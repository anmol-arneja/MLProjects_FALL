PART III 

This file contains instructions on how to run the Naive Bayes algorithm and SVM algorithm
******Naive Bayes code is fully implemented in Python*****
******SVM is implemented using sklearn.svm library in Python*****
******We also implemented Naive Bayes and KNeighborsClassifier using sklearn library in 
Python*****
******Before running the code please check if you need to install some module in order 
to run it*****
***********We also have a file for plotting how results*******

The code contains following files:

* main 
This file is the run the whole code including data extraction, feature selection, naive bayes and svm.

* defines 
In this file we define or train and test data, labels and selected features.

* feature_select
This file contains the algorithm for mutual information method for feature selection.

* naive_bayes
This file contains the algorithm for naive bayes fully implemented and we also used 
coutvectorizer library in sklean to count frequency of our features. 

* svm 
This file contains the algorithm for support vector machine, k-nearneighbor and 
multinomial naive bayes using python libraries in sklearn in addition to using coutvectorizer
library in sklean to count frequency of our features. 

* proj_plots
This file contains the code to plot our accuracy vs. feature number results and we do it using 
matplotlib.pyplot library in python to visualize our results.

TO Run :
1.Choose which functions in the main file you want to run by commenting in - out 
2.Run main function
