0,"  I touched my arm on the stove, and I got burned, and I cried.__EOS__  I bet you did. I bet that hurt. What happened? Did Daddy let you cook by yourself or something? Oh, God. OK. The court says that I'm not supposed to say anything, but I would be, like, totally negligent if I didn't tell you that you really have to watch yourself when you're alone with Daddy, OK?__EOS__  Margo was there.__EOS__  Margo? You mean our Margo? Margo who was at our house, that Margo? Do you have a nice room at Daddy's?",1
1," You analyze the lyrics and then you realize, Oh, a tune like telling just don't think about the future. Just don't talk about that. Let's just enjoy now.__EOS__ Signs of unstable times, that Zhang says still resonate in today's China.__EOS__ There's nothing guaranteed, you know. Mentally, you're very pressured in a way.__EOS__ And that feeling is bound to cross cultures, says Dave Liang, of the Shanghai Restoration Project.",2
2," storytelling and presenting music with a message. __EOS__ When Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr. came on to the hip-hop scene, it was the beginning of an era, just not his. __EOS__  One, two, three and to the four. Snoop Doggy Dog and Dr. Dre is at the door, Ready to make an entrance so back on up. Because we know we about rip  up. __EOS__ Common broke on to the scene in the early 1990s, just as gangster rap was starting its assault on mainstream America. ",2
3," Yeah. And so it was the first uncensored prison magazine. You won many awards, including the George Polk Award. And you investigated things that were happening in prison. I mean, it was like a real newspaper, reporting on what was happening inside. How did you know, how did you figure out that that's what you should be doing, that you would be good at it, that you would like it, that you would make a difference? __EOS__ I didn't know that when I started out. All I - what I - what I really wanted to do was tell - put it this way  When I was released off death row, I was released into what then was the bloodiest prison in the nation. And the things I saw, and the way, you know, what I saw going on in that place, I was so shocked and offended, and that's where I just felt that, you know, society doesn't know this. __EOS__ A warden. __EOS__ Yeah, C. Paul Phelps. He thought that a free press could perhaps make a difference. ",0
4," Classical pianist Vladimir Horowitz, in the 20 years since his death, has only gained in stature as one of the titans of 20th century music. As insecure as he was accomplished, he at once craved the public's rapturous attention then shunned it altogether. __EOS__ Horowitz contracted a private company to cut lacquer disc recordings of all of his Carnegie Hall recitals. They are admittedly not high fidelity, but that's more than amply compensated for by Horowitz's muscular tone and vibrant orchestral palette. __EOS__ Like many great artists, Horowitz suffered from extreme mood swings and even submitted himself to electroshock therapy in the 1960s to alleviate his bipolar symptoms. Later, he would try antidepressants but found that they severely impaired his ability to play music. __EOS__ But there is also unalloyed energy and joy in these recordings, especially when Horowitz is pulling off a brisk, virtuosic run. He achieved his gorgeous tone and singing, swinging sense of melody by keeping his fingers near to the keys, not lifting them off and striking the poor ivories as some showier pianists do. ",2
5," Do you hear saxophones when you're playing? Do you think saxophone lines of like, you know, sort of like Coltrane?  __EOS__ No, but I think the breathing thing kind of went in there and never stopped. So I tend to take a breath, taking - playing guitar. Whereas, when you hear a lot of rock guitars, they're not really breathing, they're just, there's no pause going on. They're just - they're very concerned if they're not playing. Even if they leave a bar empty for the drums to go by they seem to, you know, especially in the last 30 years, where you have this kind of speed guitar player who just doesn't stop.  __EOS__ You seemed impressed with the improvisatory nature of jazz? __EOS__ Yeah. To me it was a kind of classical music that you didn't write down. You just stepped up and played, and that was really appealing to me. ",2
6," They had some pretty strong ideas. They had some pretty strong ideas about their own faith and their own virtue, and the virtue of their own faith. So these people who founded Massachusetts, they were seeking religious liberty, and they were complaining about the persecutions they suffered in England. And of course, the first thing they do when they get to Massachusetts is persecute others and persecute their religions.__EOS__ So, so many settlers in the colonies were Protestants from England. How did religion come into play in the justification of the Revolutionary War, which was going to be fought against fellow Protestants?__EOS__ That's a great question, and historians still argue a lot about religion and the American Revolution. I argue in the book that religion provided some of the core ideas for a lot of the people who would become founders and certainly the people who fought against British rule.__EOS__ How do you think the idea of separation of church and state has evolved over time?",0
7,"  I have to. And I'm not gonna.__EOS__  Well, we got to. Otherwise we're dead. They're just going to have to go back down the same way they come. Come on.__EOS__  Just one clear shot. That's all I want.__EOS__  Come on.",3
8," Ugh.__EOS__ What happened? When was that?__EOS__ I think I was like 20 years old. It was in Florida. It was the second season. I worked at this restaurant and I remember watching the first season and being like, well, I'll go try out for ""American Idol."" Why not, you know? My dad and I drove to Miami - I lived in St. Petersburg at the time. And we stood in line for I think 27 hours.__EOS__ After three notes.",2
9," And that's the movement which has most to do with hell and with judgment and the terror. And he has but a few lines from that and then he moves on. __EOS__ The other interesting thing that scholars would debate about is in one text, the original text, in Latin reads  Deliver the souls of all faithful departed. And Faure eliminates the word faithful, so deliver the souls of all departed, somewhat say that wasn't an oversight. He meant to make a statement by that. __EOS__ That certainly the statement the church means to make. November 11th is Veterans Day here in the U.S. and celebrated at Episcopal Churches around the world as a day to remember the casualties of war. __EOS__ And during the Falkland's War when Mrs. Thatcher want a triumphful service, it wasn't a ""Requiem"" but the dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, Alan Webster, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, insisted on praying for all the dead - the Argentine dead as well as the British. ",2
10," They continued to use it in their music for ""We are the Robots"" and ""The Man Machine."" And it sounded perfectly natural in the context of Kraftwerk because they were doing purely electronic music. __EOS__ We're charging our battery and now we're full of energy. We are the robots. We are the robots. We are... __EOS__ You know, it seems to me that from what you're saying, the use of the vocoder started with experimental music - maybe avant-garde music - but then eventually it moved into mainstream with hip-hop, right? __EOS__ It became the voice of electro-funk hip-hop in the early '80s. In particular, Michael Jonzun - he's a disco musician from Boston - recorded perhaps the first entire hip-hop vocoder album, ""Lost in Space,"" which was released in 1983. And the song called ""Pack Jam"" was inspired by his intent to destroy all Pacman, or Pacman machines, because the videogame made him dizzy. ",2
11," Wild. Wild. __EOS__ There's all these theatrics and dirty like lurching sound. __EOS__ I have an attitude towards these dirty sounds and the grotesque in my shows, and I like to scare people a little, but then to make them feel safe again, and let them go home hugging each other like friends. __EOS__ What do the theatrics add to it like in this song, ""Medusa Cha Cha Cha""? ",2
12," It was based on - at least in part on a couple of people that we knew growing up. I don't want to say who for obvious reasons. __EOS__ But we added a lot of horrible warm empathy... __EOS__ ...which Fred Melamed, the actor, certainly made hay with. __EOS__ So what did they do that made them insufferable? ",1
13," Okay. __EOS__ And Dr. Nuland, thank you for your time today. __EOS__ Oh, what a pleasure. __EOS__ Sherwin Nuland is the author of, most recently, ""The Art of Aging  A Doctor's Prescription for Well-Being."" He joined us today from our bureau in Chicago. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0
14," I thought one of the most unusual stories that you heard was told by the mother who sold her child's Social Security number.__EOS__ Some women are able to raise money by letting friends or relatives use their children's Social Security numbers to claim tax credits, and this woman, her sister, I think it was, had promised her $3,000 - had promised her a share of the $3,000 tax credit if she could lend her the Social Security numbers of the kids, and the woman did it but was complaining she didn't get the full sum that she was owed.__EOS__ One of the things that welfare reform was supposed to do was promote a work ethic. Can you evaluate whether that has succeeded?__EOS__ Well, I would say it has succeeded, because low-income since mothers went to work in much greater shares than they ever had before. It was partly the great economy of the late 1990s. It was partly the provision of extra benefits like tax credits and child care that helped people take low-wage jobs. But certainly when you have less access to cash aid, it did prompt more people to go to work.",3
15," Yeah, it was and it was curated in a peculiar way. __EOS__ But, you know, actually you sort of retrospect but, you know, if you look back on it, it's really interesting. __EOS__ There was this guy in Minneapolis named Mel Jazz who had a matinee movie, it was the afternoon movie, and it was very different than now. Now you have all these choices but here as Joel says, he was the curator. If you wanted to watch a movies you watched Mel Jazz had programmed. And he would have, you know, Hercules movies, but he would also have, you know, ""8�."" He bought probably the Joel Levine catalog, so he had all the Italian movies. So that was kind of our high low introduction to movies. __EOS__ That's funny. And did he talk during the movies? ",1
16," Really it was a fantastic week. I was feeling really, really good. It could have come in another moment and it would have been very painful and I would have been suffering a lot. Because I really - I put a lot of heart in this CD. It's a very important project for me. __EOS__   __EOS__ The whole CD follows a certain projection. Not only in terms of the songs that you're singing, the titles that you've chosen, but in the way you sing them. __EOS__ Yes, absolutely. And the order was very important. It's about really the momentum of the characters in the love story in the beginning of the CD. As I say it's the construction of the crystal castle. Then in the middle of CD tragedy pops up and it talks about suffering and it talks about betrayal and it talks about all these terrible things that could happen in a love story. ",2
17," And before long, he was a lookout. __EOS__ That's exactly right. My mother always says, she says, you know, kids need to think that you care before they care what you think. What Wes saw from the streets and from, you know, the kids on the corner and the kids who were dealing was he saw kids who he felt at that time genuinely cared about him and genuinely cared about his future. And he saw what they had and the material items that they had and how cool they looked, and then you see these kids who are willing to take you in and embrace you as family. __EOS__ Now, we should say that you also had run-ins with the law yourself, and you flirted with the idea of walking across that line and leading a life that could ultimately have led to prison. But when you were arrested for spraying graffiti on a wall, you immediately knew this is not someplace I want to be. And you were with someone who had a very different reaction. He almost dealt with the cops like, come on, bring it on. I'm tougher than you are. __EOS__ Thats exactly right, and you know, I think about it, and it is almost embarrassing now to think about the fact that I was, you know, here I was with, you know, with a tremendous mother and, you know, support from family but just this draw of the streets and this challenge that I was personally having internally about what does it mean to be a man, was really pulling at me. So it manifested itself in things like vandalism and getting into fights. ",0
18," Ooh. Well, she's growing up in a household where she can certainly pick up the fundamentals. __EOS__ Absolutely. __EOS__ You know about Twitter and Facebook? __EOS__ I've only heard about Twitter, and I know about Facebook because my wife just got me a Facebook page, and at some point during this tour that I'm on,  she's going to show me how to do it myself. ",2
19," Well, the psychology of fans, the sport itself - it's the same psychology that applies to any group membership. People are drawn to their groups, they insert themselves in the groups and those groups serve very fundamental, interpersonal and psychological needs. So even a team - you're not part of that group. You're not playing on that group. It's true. You're just a spectator of their performance. Still, their outcome is your outcome. You are psychologically a part of that group. And when it fails, you have failed.__EOS__ Chris says that he talked to one of his good friends who was watching the game at home and he said he even had physical reactions to the game. Let's play that clip.__EOS__ He just wasn't handling it well and transformed from someone who enjoyed the game a lot to someone who just was kind of incapacitated by how anxious he was feeling during the train wreck as everything kind of came off the rails. Watching, he was, like, physically uncomfortable to the point that he had to get up and leave his apartment. And, you know, he said even his wife recognized that there was a marked change in his demeanor. I don't know if she used the word terrifying or concerning or - but it was concerning enough that she noticed it and encouraged him to, you know, leave the TV behind.__EOS__ Now, I don't know this gentleman, but I do know that, in this area where I live, in the Washington, D.C. area, people say that they notice a marked change in the atmosphere in the local metropolitan area depending on whether the local football team, the Redskins, win or lose. Is that typical?",3
20," Yeah, that's a good way of - I mean, look, if you're a tormented Christian who's frustrated with the God who will not answer, be happy that he doesn't answer you because this is what happens when the God you worship answers you sometimes. __EOS__ There was that Onion story years ago. __EOS__ Oh, yeah. __EOS__ Which you edited. Yeah, go ahead. ",1
21,"  And I've been waking in the morning just like every other day, and just like every boring blues song, I get swallowed by the pain. And so I fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away...__EOS__ It is a skill, though, to be able to write songs that make people feel like they understand some kind of intimate part of you, yet be able to keep something for yourself.__EOS__ Yeah. Well, I mean, to me there are three parts to art - I mean, well, certainly to the art that I make. There's catharsis - which is, you know, dealing with the downsides of life. Then, of course, there's got to be empathy as well 'cause otherwise, it's just me reading out pages of my diary, which is embarrassing. You know, it's got to be presented in a way...__EOS__ Which could also be interesting.",2
22," Bobby Timmons played piano. When we finished a tune and before I made an announcement on the mic, he'd play this little lick or something. __EOS__ Usually, if you don't like something, you walk away from it. If you listen to a recording, you take the tone arm off, you push the button. If you're in a club, you walk out. But if it's you you don't like, it's a little strange, you know. __EOS__ Frankly, we didn't expect any kind… __EOS__ In fact, I thought I wouldn't play again because my interest now was in the writing. And then I got the itch. I hadn't played in seven or eight years. It was like getting over a stroke, you know. Everything had gone - the armature was gone, cobwebs in the brain. It took me 10 years to get comfortable again. ",2
23," Well, and I think a lot of times the depth with which Simon writes will leave people kind of feeling that it is kind of haunting and that he is kind of dark. I think to me, he's always been more of a novelist, almost, than a songwriter. He's just got a great knack for developing complex characters and showing you some sort of internal or external struggle. And Simon has kind of always been important to Omaha but he was one of the first guys in the late 80s and early 90s who really just kind of came into these open mike nights and painted with his own brush. And it was so powerful that I think he really, really influenced some of the younger songwriters who are now making a name for Omaha. __EOS__ One of those songwriters, perhaps the best known, is Conor Oberst. The 20-something fronts the indie rock band, Bright Eyes, and has been called a foxy young Bob Dylan by Rolling Stone. Although Oberst has packed up and moved to New York, his record label, Saddle Creek, is based solidly in Omaha. But there's another sound coming out of this city that doesn't involved any singers  jazz. One album, Fractured Intuition, was recently released by Omaha musicians Kevin Pike and John Kotchian. __EOS__ I think Kevin and John are unique in that they're kind of a part of this younger crowd, where you maybe would expect them to be out in a garage wearing a flannel shirt, screaming, but they chose to really discipline themselves and study jazz and have just done some amazing stuff with it. __EOS__ Is there much of a jazz scene there in Omaha? ",2
24,"  You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle or sneeze or burp or fart. So no, no, no annoying sounds. Right? __EOS__ Does this count as annoying? __EOS__ The main character is called Gru, and the actor who provides his voice is TV and movie star Steve Carell. He's in our New York studios. Welcome to the program. __EOS__ Thank you very much. ",1
25," That's why… __EOS__ …but we both are tongue-rollers and we both have attached earlobes, so that was - it was kind of my little scientific experiment. And then, it was interesting as we did find, as you've said, the similar manners is we both just stipulate a lot when we talk, we're both very animated and expressive, we're both - we both kind of mock-type while we speak, often as we're thinking things sometimes. __EOS__ Which is an odd thought, but it turned out, again, uncanny similarities. You both suffered from depression in college. You both took up very broadly similar careers; both interested in the same kinds of movies. Elyse, you were studying to be a film director. Paula Bernstein, you write about film. You've found out later you could have run into each other in the same movie theater in New York - the Angelika. __EOS__ It is true. ",0
26," Yeah - well one, ""Pink Flamingos,"" which was basically about the filthiest people alive, and they were. __EOS__ And I read that you've dedicated the film ""Female Trouble"" to Tex Watson, who was really one of the, you know... __EOS__ Well, yeah, and that was really irresponsible, and I admit that. This chapter is as much of how I've changed, you know, through this. Charles Watson is basically who killed every one of the victims. He was Manson's best piece of work ever. But I'm not here to stick up for any of them but for Leslie. I'm not sure that all of them didn't have the same thing happen to them. They were controlled by a madman. __EOS__ Why do you think you were so fascinated with the Manson case and a lot of other cases where it seems you do have a real interest in crime? ",0
27," Right now, we're driving south. We're going to what we call the south place. __EOS__ This is where Craig's great-great-grandparents - or my kid's great-great-grandparents homesteaded. And on the horizon is lots of houses that weren't here five years ago, and they just steadily creep north. __EOS__ They all look the same. There's nothing different about them. __EOS__ We like on a farm that, when I married my husband, was three miles north of Ankeny, which is a suburb that's just north of Des Moines. We are now surrounded on three sides of our farm with subdivisions. Our neighbors to the south sold for $23,000 an acre, and we have a neighbor to the east of us that sold for $45,800 an acre, I think. He got a dollar a square foot. We own, our family - not just Craig and I, but family members - own about 800 acres. And some people think I should cash in my chips and become a millionaire, but I don't know that many rich people that are happy. And my kids are pretty well grounded in agriculture, and they want to have a future here. And as long they want to do it, I will be here to make sure that the city honors the boundaries that - around this farm. This is a farm, and it's going to remain a farm. ",3
28," Yes. That's all I did. The first thing before we started shooting, I said to Murray, I said, well, the first thing that comes to mind is, I'm not a very attractive man, nor have I ever been. And if I looked like this as a woman, I would have a lot of trouble.__EOS__ Did it make you rethink the kind of woman you were attracted to after thinking of yourself as an unattractive woman?__EOS__ Say again?__EOS__ OK. So many men, even if they think they're not attractive, really feel this desire that they have to, you know, be a partner with a beautiful woman.",1
29," Yeah. But in the same time, they really want African expression, even they need more electrical sound, you know, a keyboard, electrical guitar, drums, but they really prefer the African expression, and it make me crazy. And live here, I think people are waiting for something more real, more traditional. And, yeah, I can do both, but it make me just crazy. __EOS__ Well, thank you for taking the time to talk to us. __EOS__ Thank you so much. __EOS__ Youssou N'Dour's new album is called ""Rokku Mi Rokka,"" or ""Give and Take."" ",2
30," He said that I said I've written about it for Newsweek magazine several times. __EOS__ I'm going to need someone who speaks English. __EOS__ The first thing to know about Iran is that it's not evil. Iranians and Americans, they have much more in common than they have different. __EOS__ But what do I have in common with you? ",3
31," It has helped me a lot in these 10 years to stay focused and trying to grasp for a higher ground because of the love that people have shown to him and to me. It gives me a sense of responsibility to those people. __EOS__ Since our conversation with Afeni Shakur, we've learned she's had to postpone her trip to South Africa and reportedly plans to spread her son's ashes in Soweto next year. __EOS__  When I was young, me and my mama  17 years old, kicked out on the street. Though back at the time I'd never see her face. Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place. Suspended from school, scared to go home. I was a fool with the big boys, breaking all the rule. Shed tears with my baby sister. Over these years we was  the little kids. And even though we had different daddies, the same drama. When things went wrong, we blamed mama. I reminisce on the stress I caused. It was hell hugging on my mama from a jail cell … __EOS__ Coming up, a new study says Americans pay a higher price for dropping out of school than people in other countries, and there's no place like home. That's because where you live can affect how long you live. We'll discuss these and other topics on our Roundtable next.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",2
32,"  Yes, that's Electric Light Orchestra's classic tune, and its title      says a lot of what a well-crafted song can do.  For nine years now,      Fountains of Wayne has made a habit of creating or re-creating melodies      that simply get stuck in one's head, and that's not a complaint. __EOS__   No, I can't get it out of my head.  No, I      can't get it out of my head. __EOS__  Ashley Kahn is author of the book ""A Love Supreme   The      Story of John Coltrane's Signature Album.""  Fountains of Wayne's new CD,      ""Out of State Plates,"" has just been released. __EOS__  And I'm Renee Montagne.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",2
33," But we are Zimbabweans. __EOS__ We don't care whether you're Indian, Malawi, Kalanga, whatnot. We just don't want you in particular. It will never be a colony again, this country. __EOS__ I realize that, Mr. Chamada. __EOS__ It will never be a colony. ",1
34," Our Tiny Desk Concerts with The Zombies is about to begin, so please head on over to the skinny end of the fifth floor. Thank you.__EOS__ We've got a new album out actually. And we're going to do a song from the album called ""Any Other Way.""__EOS__  Still remember seeing you standing there alone in a crowded room. Suddenly, your presence fills the air, nothing that I could do. Always knew you were the only one, I never told you so. Thought you'd understand what I had done when I had to let you go...__EOS__ The Zombies, Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone, came together in 1961 to form The Zombies and maybe best known for hits like ""Time of the Season."" Or maybe it would be this one, ""She's Not There.""",2
35," Yeah. Oh, he thought I was the cutest chickie walking around. But he had very bad eyesight. __EOS__ So I think most people know that, you know, he took his life after... __EOS__ Killed himself, yeah. __EOS__ Yeah - and this was not long - it was, like, a few months after your late-night show, which he was producing, on Fox was canceled. And apparently, the network asked him to leave. You opposed that, and then the whole show got canceled. ",1
36," 'Cause you wanted to know, you know, what jazz artists were playing in the city when your team was out of town. When you played the Knicks, for example, you went to Birdland. But I'm interested in the music. Did the music -did you turn to the music in times of trouble? __EOS__ Not really. I just - I was a jazz lover. Don't ask me how I come by being a jazz lover and finished high school in 1946. Everybody else was listening to singing groups, you know. And I just, I mean, you know, Dexter Gordon and Miles Davis and Yusef Lateef and Jimmy Smith, you know. I just took a liking, you know. And in a sense it was an escape. I mean, you got to do something. You know, I tried to going to the late movies. And, you know, the late movies, you know, some strange folks in late movies, you know, drunks, you know. __EOS__ You're on 42nd Street in New York and you get anything, you know. So, I said I better find me another avenue, you know? But I had a good ride. I had a good ride in professional basketball. __EOS__ That's pro basketball Hall of Famer Earl Lloyd. His memoir, written with Sean Kirst and published by Syracuse University Press, is called ""Moonfixer  The Basketball Journey of Earl Lloyd, the first African American to Play with the NBA."" Lloyd joined us from member station WFAE in Charlotte, North Carolina. Thank you so much, Mr. Lloyd. ",0
37,"  Okay. Damien, we're go for explosion. Ready to kick the tires, light the fires on your say-so. Damien, we're go for explosion. __EOS__ I love the idea that you, the special effects man, lost a finger in ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" which is… __EOS__ …which was a special-effects-heavy film, of course. __EOS__ Oh, that's such a slow-moving film about, you know, a driver and a woman that he drives. ",3
38," No. You see...__EOS__ And were tormented and wrestling with their true nature that they couldn't express?__EOS__ No. You never got to that point, but that's because these ended when they did as a popular pop culture form. If these had lasted and thrived into the 1980s, let's say, or certainly the '90s, you would have started to see those stories. But at this point, even the religion question was usually cloaked in these. So there was an issue called ""Different"" in one of the Simon and Kirby books, and they never really say what the different thing is about the guy, but clearly it's that he's Jewish. I mean anybody like me, who's Jewish, could read the story and say, oh, I mean yeah, that's what this is. But they don't come right out and say it because it was 1952.__EOS__ So how did you figure out that this guy was Jewish and that that was his secret?",0
39," The White Mandingos came together at Jenifer's house in Woodstock, where he and Jenkins would hang out and jam. But what they were laying down didn't really add up to anything until Jenkins says his partner thought to call Murs.__EOS__ Once he hit it with the lyrics, it opened up. Like something you may not like, like, wow, I don't understand that. You put some lyrics on it, oh, and then it becomes the best thing there.__EOS__  I sent my demo to the demons up at Warner Brothers. Now they say they want to sign me lying . I know I'm getting got, but  I need a start. I'll renegotiate once I hit the charts. But now I kick back and enjoy the ride. Spend my advance and swallow my pride...__EOS__ Murs made his name over the last 15 years on the independent hip-hop circuit, playing punk and rock festivals. He says all three musicians have never quite fit in.",2
40," Hamed Wardak says that the group has 3,000 members, and you're saying that a group that appears to be this grassroots lobbying group representing Afghan-Americans is really a front group for the special interests of one man or one company or other companies that are - that have similar interests and that interest is in American long-term commitment in Afghanistan, because that will mean the American military will continue to pay this group and other groups like it. __EOS__ That would make sense. But really, you know, ideologies are tough to obviously parse out. You know, often you'll find people - their ideology coincides with whatever helps them financially, right? Or their business tends to work in line of their ideology. So I'm not saying, oh, Hamed Wardak believes this just because he's profiting from it. But what I am saying is the evidence is there that this group, which represents itself as sort of a group of, you know, concerned Afghan-Americans and so on, was set up by one particular high-paid lobbying firm in Washington - Patton Boggs is a law firm in Washington - basically for Hamed Wardak. __EOS__ So what are the implications of that? What does that mean? Does that - do you think that that means that they should not have any influence on Capitol Hill or that they should be taken less seriously... __EOS__ No, no, no. ",0
41," Probably not. __EOS__ Caustic things to say about Tom Hicks. __EOS__ Tom Hicks, I think, sort of broke the mold when he signed Rodriguez to that $253 million dollar deal. I mean that was more money than he paid for the stadium and the franchise, if you can imagine, at that time… __EOS__ Mm-hmm. ",0
42," My Journey Through the Valley of the Shadow."" __EOS__ I embraced the diagnosis and started girding myself to die. No disbelief, no anger, no bargaining. In fact, if anything, I walked around in a pink cloud for a day or two, feeling my death, getting used to it. Was my theology working, or was I simply in denial or shock? Looking back, was your theology working or were you in denial or shock? __EOS__ It was working. Every minister spends a lifetime preparing for this exam. The most important work we do is done with families in bereavement. But we really don't know, having given all of this advice and held all of these hands and walked all of these journeys through the valley, how we ourselves are going to respond. And it was a great relief to me that I was able to embrace my death. I sensed that if you've made peace with your life, you can make peace with your death. But if you haven't, it's much more difficult. __EOS__ Okay. So, on the one hand, you feel like you reached acceptance of your death right after your diagnosis, and you kind of entered the zone. ",0
43," And also songs that I've been listening to lately are from Ali Farka Toure because he has been gone for a while now. It's an album of reminiscence for me because I have the chance to have him actually home for dinner one or two months before he passed away. And for me it's really in this hard time, he's the one that I look up to.__EOS__ And, of course, Miriam Makeba is always something that I listen to on a regular basis.__EOS__ She has been my role model. I learned through her how to harmonize and how you can use your voice as a powerful tool to talk about things that are universal that touch everybody. I have ""Pata Pata"" in mind because it's a song that everybody knows, everybody sings to touch each other. And for me in this era of communication, we don't speak to each other much. The technology is a very good invention, but does it bring us more together or does it push us far away from each other?__EOS__ Every Friday and Saturday night, it's Pata Pata time.",3

45," An example that I found really fascinating, and this is when the Hollywood studios were still trying to maintain some kind of foothold in European markets, including Germany and Italy, MGM had optioned a play by Robert Sherwood, and wanted to adapted it into a movie, and the play was called ""Idiot's Delight."" Describe what the play was and describe how the movie turned out.__EOS__ The play was about a group of tourists who were caught in an Italian hotel, I think, a hotel on the border of Italy, when the Italians had started bombing, I believe it was Paris. I can't remember. But anyway, they were caught there. And the story is about, you know, the interaction between these tourists. And when the play was optioned to make a movie, MGM said it couldn't be Italy because they didn't want to offend Mussolini. And also they couldn't speak Italian because that would offend Mussolini, so they spoke in Esperanto. And...__EOS__ In an unnamed country.__EOS__ In an unnamed country. And this movie had absolutely no connection to the play that Robert Sherwood had written. And he was asked later on if he had a collaborator on this movie. And he said yes, I had one, and that was Mussolini.",3
46," Yes. I was always interested in trying to help our country behave. __EOS__ In 1961, she joined Women Strike for Peace, a group of moms that protested the growing threat of nuclear testing. The group opposed the Vietnam War. And in 1965, while on a trip to Moscow, she took a clandestine side trip to North Vietnam to meet with Vietnamese mothers who also wanted an end to the war. She said she lived a full life as a parent and as citizen engaged in the world around her. __EOS__ The night he died, across the street here at St. Vincent's Hospital, I closed the club that night. Max never asked me to run the club and he asked nobody because he was indomitable, as we all think we are. I closed it for one night, and the next night I opened it. __EOS__ Barry Singer was Gordon's co-writer for her memoir ""Alive at the Village Vanguard."" ",3
47," But you are playing him at that moment. You're the one running down the street in the flip-flops. Is that hard to do - to figure out, how do I this without clowning it too much, without making me a pathetic figure?__EOS__ It would be hard to do if you didn't trust the director. There is a very big difference between doing that for Alexander Payne, and doing that for someone that you don't trust because, you know, the product you're selling out there is you, right? I mean, it's not like, well, here's another set of encyclopedias if you don't like this one. It's you.__EOS__ You've said in interviews that you are starting to transition away from acting - or at least away from a certain kind of part, in a certain kind of movie. What does that mean?__EOS__ Well, I'm not going to do any more films in rubber suits, I've decided. I've learned from ""Batman."" You know, as you get older, the one thing you have to understand as an actor is that change is inevitable, and growing old on screen is not for the faint of heart. You know, there's a certain cruelty to being on a big screen as your - you know, as your eyelids start to sag and your hair falls out and turns gray, that you either have to be able to handle or not. And what you can't do is try to force yourself into roles that you could have played, or would have played, 10 years earlier.",1

But I don't think this is a time to celebrate or run some victory lap.

52," But did FDR give it his blessing because he wanted America to go to war?__EOS__ FDR gave this group his blessing because they were doing his work, which is basically to discredit American isolationists. I don't think quite frankly that he ever really wanted to go to war, certainly in the sense of sending troops to Europe. But he certainly wanted to help England. He certainly wanted to provide them all the aid that he could so that they could survive. And he would do anything he could to discredit those who were working against that.__EOS__ So is there an example of some either dirt that this British group dug up or information that they forged that will show what they were up to?__EOS__ A couple of months before we got into the war, FDR produced a map that he said showed that Latin America was going to be divided up into five German vassal states. In other words, that Germany planned to come over and establish German states in Latin and South America. And he said this map was a German map and proved it. Well, it caused all sorts of great furor in the country. And it turned out actually, that that map was a forgery, that the British had forged it and had slipped it to FDR. There's no sign that FDR knew it was a forgery. He apparently thought it was real, it was accurate, but in fact, it was a forgery of the British.",3

I couldn't scream. All I did was cry. __EOS__ You have put a lot of work into your career, not just the creative, but also self-producing your albums, which can't have been easy. But this disk, ""Lost and Found,"" takes you into territory where you're a lot more produced. What was it like to give up that control but also get other people's talents into your music? __EOS__ Well, for me, I produced everything with the producers that are on my record. I still had a lot of control. I had started on my record before I sign with a major label. I didn't know how I was going to pay for it. These were friends of mine. We were hanging out. We didn't have a plan. Everything was just, let's just hang and write something together and let don't stress about it because I was really weary of recording again. I didn't want to go back in the studio and go back into the hot seat of pressure of being an artist again. I just really wanted to just teach and be quiet, you know, and not perform. I was really done with the business. And to have finished it and to know towards the end of the record that all of this is worth it, win or lose, I just had a wonderful time making it. __EOS__ Tell me about the title track. ",2
54," Well, I always say the same thing, Terry. __EOS__ Say it again. __EOS__ I'll say it again. Being known as Columbo, it ain't cancer, so... __EOS__ I mean I make a lot of dough, and the listeners, you know, I think it's difficult for the average person to say what is - what is he complaining about, that he's typecast? Who the hell cares? I mean, he does make a lot of money and he gets good seats in restaurants. So I don't feel that that's something that people are really interested in. ",3
55,"  Oh, congratulations. __EOS__  So it... __EOS__  Hey, fantastic.  You know, one more thing.  My sister had a      friend that worked for Sony in A&R, P&R, and I think his name was A.J.--I      don't know if you knew him.  Does that ring a bell? __EOS__  A.J.?  Probably. ",2

Anything that you can't grasp, if you bring it down to where you can laugh at it, it becomes manageable and you become in charge of it. __EOS__ You're still working a lot. __EOS__ More than ever.

57," We have a number of ways of helping countries in transition - through AID, through the National Endowment for Democracy, through the Republican and Democratic Party institutes, and through a lot of NGOs - training people who are setting up a party for the first time in, how do you organize a party; how do you communicate with voters; how do you reach out? We know a little bit about this. So do the Europeans. So, especially, do people who've been through it a lot more recently than we have   the Poles, the Czechs, the Chileans. And we ought to try to organize and make sure that people, especially with more recent experience, get over to these new democracies - or countries trying to be democracies - and give them whatever help they can. __EOS__ Many, many people - fairly or unfairly - argue that, you know, the Bush administration pushed the freedom agenda at the point of a gun, and Iraq and Afghanistan were sort of their primary examples. If, in fact, this is the result of an ideal or values that were proposed by President George W. Bush, or going all the way back to Woodrow Wilson, what happens now? I mean, should the United States actively back other movements in other Middle Eastern countries? __EOS__ I'm not arguing that the United States should have a policy of overthrowing everybody's government. We had nothing to do with the uprising in Tunisia or Egypt or in Libya. These are spontaneous moves on the part of the people of those countries. __EOS__ When they make that move, how do we react? And I'm just suggesting that we should react favorably. We should react by saying, you know, it's your country, but anything we can do to help freedom expand, we want to do. We believe in it, and it's in our interests. ",3

Did they really have an intimate relationship? Did they ever consummate that relationship? How do you get insights into that?__EOS__ Well, I started by reading everything I could on the man, and for me it's important to try and get firsthand sources. And thankfully there are still a lot of FBI guys who are around that knew him, and a lot of them have settled down here in Simi Valley in Southern California.",1
61," Right.__EOS__ What about the argument that all of this border enforcement - the Obama administration has deported more people than any other administration - what if that is the cause of this reverse migration? Perhaps that's the reason why we're seeing fewer Mexican migrants coming to the U.S.__EOS__ Well, when I did a systematic analysis using the data that I've been collecting in Mexico and on this side of the border for the past 30 years, and looked at what was predicting the rates of in-and-out migration, I find that the enforcement effort, as I said earlier, had this negative effect on return migration, but had zero effect on the rate of in-migration, which was driven, initially, almost entirely by U.S. labor demand.__EOS__ Well, let's talk about the rhetoric in Washington because in many ways these decisions on immigration, as you've said, dating back to the 1960s at the very least don't have very much to do with practical reality, right? I mean, it's usually about political mores and what people need to talk about. That the rhetoric people need to use or feel they need to use in order to get elected and reelected.",3

As you point out, maybe a few of them have come back and taken the course again. Have any of them published books? __EOS__ Many of them have published books. Many of them are the voices you hear on my local public radio. Many of them are the people that you read in the newspaper. I have one student who wrote - who happened to be the nurse on duty when Ronald Reagan was shot. And she came to me with a story that was enormous.

Mike Newell was supposed to direct the film, but he was invited to do the      ""Harry Potter,"" and so when I met Simon, I mean, one week before he had      lost his director for the project, he gave me the script.  I read it      during the night in the hotel and I came back next day; it was a very      interesting story setting, in Africa.  I thought it would be very      interesting shooting in Africa.

Very quickly he became conflicted by his role there and he became a man really torn between loyalties. Yes, he was a British officer in the field. But because he was in military intelligence in Cairo, he knew of the betrayal that was coming; the way the British and the French have divided up the Middle East between themselves, detail that the Arabs knew nothing about. And the longer he spent in the field, and he's recruiting men to go on missions with him and he's fighting alongside them and they're dying alongside him, the more I think he felt just a crushing sense of guilt about his role in the war. And in ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"" he talks about feeling like he was a charlatan. And this is one of the most interesting things.

I was the only one who didn't read his part. I could pick it up by ear, because I learned a lot of the records, as well. There were a couple of people in that band - the first trumpet player and the drummer - who had everything from, oh, you know, early Miff Mole and stuff like that, all the way through Teddy Wilson and Tatum and Fats Waller.

Because for people maybe who are familiar with your music from when you were younger, you know, kind of being, like, this punk kid, what was it like writing about these scenes now?__EOS__ Yeah. I mean, it's so odd to talk about the way parenthood and growing up effects art because we automatically have all these assumptions that, you know, it's going to be like a parent writing lullaby songs to put their infant baby to sleep or, you know, maturing and things getting safe and vanilla. But for me, hanging out with a baby has, like, actually made the world volatile to me and more - the stakes are higher, I guess. So, when you bring in a new generation you stop feeling the clock ticking on your own.

But when push came to shove, when I actually got to it, there was just a little voice that told me, you know, maybe it's time to try something different. Maybe there are ways you can express your patriotism and not necessary follow in this tradition. After all, I felt like we'd maxed the course on that area. And I looked at the difficulty my dad had, sort of, trying to live up to the shadow of his father and I thought, you know what? Let's try and be the best in another category. __EOS__ I understand we should congratulate you, that you're going to celebrate your first Father's Day this year. __EOS__ Yeah, it's pretty exciting.

It was kind of fun. We alternated. If it was Chick's tune, he was the boss. If I was - if it's my tune, I was the boss. But it wasn't a - it was just because somebody had to make a decision. And it went quicker that way, . But everybody contributed a lot to each other's tunes.

88," And I'm like, I don't like J.K. Rowling anymore. Actually, I am a purist and I do not like to mix my Harry Potter and my ""Twilight."" I have a pile next to my bed and it's the seven Harry Potter books and I have the three ""Twilight"" books. I don't want to get those worlds mixed, because once I do I know it's just going to go crazy.__EOS__ If Jojo is worried about mixing up her imaginary worlds now, just wait till she reads Meyer's new book, ""The Host."" Geared to the adult market, it's a science fiction romance where two women, one an alien from outer space, inhabit the same body and are in love with the same man. Meyer says writing dialogue for characters that share the same body wasn't a problem for her.__EOS__ All of these characters in my other books, in this book, all of them take place in one head - mine. So I'm really used to internal conversations. That came pretty easily. I hear voices all the time.__EOS__ And just as Meyer writes about good vampires in the ""Twilight"" books, she's created kinder, gentler alien invaders in ""The Host.""",0
89," Mr. Zuckerman had the best swing in the county. It was a single long piece of heavy rope tied to the beam over the north doorway. The bottom end of the rope was a fat knot to sit on. It was arranged so that you could...__EOS__ It was arranged so that you could swing without being pushed. You climbed a ladder to the hayloft, then holding the rope you stood at the edge and looked down. And you were scared and dizzy. Then you straddled the knot so that it acted as a seat. And you got up all your nerve, took a deep breath and jumped.__EOS__ E.B. White started reading that passage. I think I never heard his voice before. And we also heard a 10-year-old from Washington, D.C. reading there.__EOS__ One of the pigs he was raising died. And while he was carrying the pails of slops every day to the replacement pig in the barn, he noticed that there was a spider attending its web every day, expanding the web, rebuilding what had happened the night before. And then one day he saw that it had spun an egg case. And so he stopped to examine it.",0

91," Let's talk about a musical family that was a huge family - would have to have a very big table to sit around - and that was the Bach's.  __EOS__ They would be the biggest, Renee. There were at least 50 Bachs who were musicians. For example, Bach's grandfather and Bach's father Johann Ambrosius. Bach himself had 20 children with two wives. The sons of Bach who were well-known musicians were Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Gottfried Heinrich Bach, Johann Christoph Bach, and Johann Christian Bach. And that's only some of them. And then we have cousins and uncles, and it just goes on and on. __EOS__ By the way, Renee, this is a little portion of a symphonia or symphony by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, the famous Bach's youngest son. He wrote some very nice pieces, but there's nothing of Wilhelm Friedemann that reaches the great heights of his daddy. __EOS__ You know, we just mentioned a moment ago Mozart's sister. How about other female - well, musicians. Or in this case how about other... ",2
92," Because the Greenpeace ships observe. They don't try and interfere, right?__EOS__ They observe, they don't — yeah. And, you know, Watson attempted to attack them.

Well, so he's got this ramming bar, I mean, this blade attached to the bow of his vessel and he's going to try and rip a hole in the hull of the Japanese ship, right? What happened?__EOS__ Well, so he had one shot at it because as soon as they would see, you know, who it was they would take off. So here he is. You know, he's coming up on them, pedal to the metal. It's sort of like, you know, give it more, Scotty. You know. Oh, Captain, she's, like, coming apart. It was like that.",0
93,"  Right.  But what I argue in my piece and what I believe firmly as a Muslim and as a writer is that we can't allow the lowest common denominator in society to define our conversations as civilizations, and literature is a critical element in moving civilizations forward.  We've got to accept that and we also need to allow for the kind of conversations that would actually move the Muslim world and the West together forward. __EOS__  And yet, you say that might happen.  Hundreds of people were killed in rioting over those Danish cartoons. __EOS__  I know, and I'm not naive about any of the risks that are playing out because of ideologies out there that support violence.  But at the same time, I know that we can be pretty smart and we can to try figure out how to take on challenges like that. __EOS__  Let's see if we can get some callers in on the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org.  And we'll begin with Abu and Abu and is with us from Charlottesville in Virginia. ",0
94,"  There's a loving in your eyes all the way.__EOS__ In 1982, the Irish-Catholic singer joined a Jewish drummer, a Protestant guitar and keyboard player and a Jamaican bassist to form the Culture Club. The band was groundbreaking, not just for its multicultural makeup, but also for its music. Culture Club combined calypso, country, reggae and pop, and they hit it big. This song, ""Karma Chameleon,"" was number one in 16 countries.__EOS__  Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon.__EOS__ Now, after Culture Club, Boy George kept recording when he could, but it's been a while. His first solo album in 19 years comes out tomorrow. When he joined us from London to talk about it, I asked him to listen back to an interview he did with Johnny Carson on ""The Tonight Show"" in 1984. Boy George had grown tired of all the DJs asking the same questions about his childhood and his look. Here's Johnny.",2
95," Well, because I am a little more noticeable and a little more above board because, in Washington, D.C. we have what, Secret Service, FBI, local law enforcement. My fights have to be a little more recognizable. Phoenix, who has a lot different drug situations, gang situations, he's a little more in the shadows, but we're still fighting the same war. It's just different battlegrounds. __EOS__ And, but can I  forgive me, I just feel like I have to ask, there are people who just think you're crazy. That you're just going to subject yourself... __EOS__ And that's fine. No, and that's fine. __EOS__ You're going to subject yourself to being hurt. ",3
96," Yup. __EOS__ where there was just this togetherness. __EOS__ You have so many great songs on this album, but what song do you think that you changed the most when - for this album? You know, because you have instrumental versions of songs with lyrics, lyrical versions of songs that were instrumentals. You know, how did you come up with the flow that allowed you to change things up? __EOS__ That's a very interesting question. I don't know. I think we did it in a good way, the changes that we made in the songs so that the songs are recognizable but they've got a different something happening on them that makes people go, oh, that is Breezin'. But I didn't know somebody was singing, is that Al? ",2
97," Tonight is the premiere of the new FX comedy series he's producing called ""Totally Biased,"" featuring comic W. Kamau Bell.__EOS__  Everything OK?__EOS__  Yeah, everything's OK, but I had a fight with that neighbor again. In the elevator, she attacked me. I had to - made up some story to get out of it. I mean, it was like horrible.__EOS__  What was she mad about?",1
98," Now, there's also another one that has to deal with Althea Gibson. You've got Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Carol Moseley-Braun. __EOS__ Oh, yes. Uh-huh. And that's the U.S. Open coming up on September 27th out at the new Billie Jean King Tennis Center. And it is a tribute to Althea Gibson, yes, and African-American women of first - some that you just named, Jackie Joyner and Carol Moseley, Susan Depeth. And I believe someone said I was in that group. I hope so. __EOS__ Absolutely. __EOS__ But that's what it's about. ",2
99," The Spelunking Club. And I said, I don't know what that word means. And I got my mother to take me over to the meeting, and suddenly, here was this thing about exploration. There was an image of a person on rope rappelling into a black abyss. It was such a perfect shot, because the pure utter blackness of what he was rappelling into, the starkness of him against that, the sun shining down on this moss-lit shaft. It was just like Jules Verne right there before my eyes, and that was it, that was the scene. It got me hooked right away.__EOS__ And everything changed at that moment. Cave exploring actually became his profession, a life right at the edge of human possibility. What you do is climb Everest in reverse. I mean, these caves are as deep as Everest is high.__EOS__ That's true but with one critical difference. On Everest, they're shedding weight as they're coming down and they're coming down light. We don't have that option. When we're at the bottom of a cave, you actually have to pull your way back out. So the hard part starts at the bottom.__EOS__ Here's Bill's TED Talk.",3
100," OK. And it was available to anybody for free. And how many people followed the course or participated?__EOS__ Well over 100,000.__EOS__ OK.__EOS__ I think getting up to 200,000, perhaps.",3
101," No. I don't believe in marriage. I just believe that if people love themselves, why do they have to get married? I never believed in that institution. I don't believe in many things. I believe if two people love themselves, they should stay together and be happy. So I try to be open with my relationship and I take my family, who I call my kids, I put them before anything, before myself. I think they are the future. __EOS__ Also very clear. __EOS__ We all accepted his 27 wives. Everybody accepted his 27 wives, except my mother, of course. __EOS__ Well, well... ",2
102," Yes. __EOS__ So I am the one, Elyse, who experienced all these separations. And in fact, I'm the one who, you know, felt that it did answer a key element of my identity meeting Paula - or not meeting Paula, but just simply learning that I had a twin. I was more relaxed knowing the truth about that I have had a twin. __EOS__ So - whereas I felt that I was less relaxed, knowing that it made my life, you know, that it brought more of a sense of anxiety about identity that in that, it - you know, it was, I mean, I think it was unnerving to both of us, but in some ways, it clicked for Elyse more. __EOS__ Well, it was unnerving when she became a reality. That was complicated. But when it was - when I got the letter and I found out I had a twin, I was elated simply knowing the truth. ",0
103," Yes, absolutely. And I think the senator showed something of his true spirit, of his faith, and how that faith plays itself out in his daily life. __EOS__ You must have watched the interview last with the ABC News and Governor Palin. __EOS__ Yes, I did. __EOS__ Did it strike you, as you were watching, as someone like us, if you will, kind of a more or less average person, talking with this network news anchor, and that the more or less average person really didn't know what the Bush doctrine is? ",3
104," Did you know how to perform onstage in a place like the Opry? __EOS__ Not really. I just got out there with my guitar, and I sang. I mean, I just did it just like I was doing it at home, you know. I never thought about it being the Grand Ole Opry because if I had, I wouldn't have been able to have done it. You just pretty well got to figure, well, you know, this is something I could do every day. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ It's so much like what you do every day. ",2
105," And it's not all his fault. He's so kind of careless about the relationship, he doesn't even remember he apologized to you five years ago.__EOS__ Yeah. And that's very Louis. I think he was being, you know, pretty honest in that exchange. And I think there was a lot of genuine emotion there. I think that on some, some part of him was, that was a genuine apology for what might have been his side of the selfishness in our relationship. I'm going to look at it that way, because I feel that - because he was definitely - just listening, and as you know, when you just listen and you don't have any visuals, there's an emotional depth to it that I don't think I really heard until I just listened to that now when you played it.__EOS__ So when I heard it, I was thinking, OK, so Louis C.K. is the new main character in this, and he's giving the blame to himself, because it's going to make it a more interesting episode, and because he's a generous guy. And so he's going to blame himself in his show and not blame you. But you think he's actually taking some of the blame for real in this.__EOS__ Well, I think that these things are two-sided, and I think that when you listen to my podcast, that I could've pointed fingers. I could've been petty, and in that moment where, you know, I take responsibility for my side of it, I could've said but you, but you this, but you that, but you - and, you know, I realized like this was - that's not the time for it. You know, understand and take the consequences of your actions. So I think there's a chance - you would have to ask Louis - if there was some part of him that was, you know, taking some responsibility, or maybe he was just, you know, created this role and did his riff on our riff, and made it his own in that way. I don't really know. You'd have to ask him. But I do know that we are getting along better.",3
106," Because, you know, there are a lot of times you are having the specialties of a country. And sometime I was having Bulgarian foods. What's the typical side for this that's really, you know, something that you recommend as a nice typical side of yours? French fries with cheese on top. And I'm like, all right. You know, you got to get it. You got to go for it. But I was really hoping he'd say salad that day. It didn't work out that way. __EOS__ There are other challenges in finding a different country's cuisine to dine on every day. Even in Southern California, it's tough locating a place that serves there from Uzbekistan or Mozambique. __EOS__ Amazingly, Scotland and Wales are really difficult. New Zealand is kind of difficult, although now, I have some options for that. __EOS__ Noah has received some help. Readers of his blog have chimed in with their recommendations. A few have even invited him over to cook him food from their homelands. But back to Afghanistan and our lunch. ",3

109," The duo called themselves Floetry, and they were successful. Natalie and Marsha released three albums in the course of four years, and Floetry earned seven Grammy nominations. But then came the pressure to conform.__EOS__ Management and the label kind of leaning. I mean, a direct quote, as I was quite often being asked to ""dumb my lyrics down,"" and to rap more so than being a poet. And I wasn't very comfortable with the route that we were being suggested to go into.__EOS__ But her friend and collaborator, Marsha, did take that route. She went to the U.S. to launch her solo career.__EOS__ She didn't want to make a neo-soul music anymore. She didn't feel like it was really who she is. She wanted to do something else. And there is room for everybody.",2
110," Thanks. __EOS__ The safety concerns with the crew I was with are always - were always present. Every one of them had a terrible story of either someone getting killed or someone, you know, seriously, you know, crushed and made it out alive. But, I mean, serious injury not just, you know, a little broken finger. So it was always a concern and there were every day, practically, a new, you know, something new that was - they were coming up with to make it a better environment. __EOS__ And a constant, you report, a constant topic of conversation is what the miners refer to as the top. This is good top. This is bad top. __EOS__ That's always the first thing that seemed that they would look at because, you know, the top is basically the roof over your head, which is barely - it's really more over your shoulder because it's only five feet tall there. And, you know, in some places, it's good and some places it's bad. It depends on the rock formation above it. It depends on whether you're, you know, in limestone or shale or what other geological forces around you. But it's, you know, it's crumbling. It's certainly crumbling a lot and caving in. I mean, there were cave-ins when I was there. It's common. ",3
111," Thank you, Rachel. I appreciate it.__EOS__ So I understand this has been a personal interest of yours for a long time - the connection that twins share.__EOS__ I grew up with twins being a sort of shadow over my childhood. My younger sister Vicki, who is two years and 10 months younger, was a twin. And I expected my mother to come home from the hospital with two babies and there was only one. And I couldn't understand why everybody else got healthy babies and somehow the baby that would have been my brother didn't make it. So, you know, as will happens with three-year-olds, I thought it had to do with the fact that he was a boy and I decided he was a kind of stand in for me. So I actually went through a little part of my childhood with the fantasy that I was an identical twin and that the other one was gone somewhere.__EOS__ Can you lay out - understanding you don't want to give too much away - but what is the central gist of the narrative?",0

And I think it plays out real well in the film.__EOS__ Was there anything in there that was embellished or just not true but made for a better movie; they needed to change something for the narrative?__EOS__ I think - I noticed one of the liberties that Hollywood took in the movie that I just kind of - I remember sitting back in my chair and was like, why would you put that in there? - is when at the very end of the movie, they have the Taliban working me over pretty good...__EOS__ Uh-huh.",0

How is Glory so brave even if grownups around her are not?__EOS__ That is a great question. And I think I made Glory very brave because so many of the kids that I knew when I was in sixth grade, really, would not have been like Glory. So I wanted her to be the exceptional child in that time period. I wanted her to do something that not many kids would do. And I think between her father and the librarian, Miss Bloom, encouraging her, Glory really sort of learned a lot and began to stand up, and I think that's why she turned out to be a whole lot braver than I or any of my friends ever were.",0

But it wasn't necessarily football that Dawidoff, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, was drawn to. He writes stories about outsiders who joined established institutions and come to affect the culture. Country stars, the topic of one of Dawidoff's books, fall into that category. So do CIA agents, who Dawidoff compares to football people in that they're resigned to living in a world thought to be understood by outsiders but which is actually obscured.__EOS__ They're NFL coaches for a reason. They are seriously motivating, nurturing, intelligent, kindhearted, dedicated people. I mean...__EOS__ One day, Rex Ryan approach Dawidoff and asked him a question.

What's that like? Dawidoff was touched.__EOS__ You know, a lot of people in my life who know all about my childhood, they've never asked me anything about this. And it was just completely natural for Rex to ask about it.

Good to have you with us. __EOS__ Thanks, it's great to be here. __EOS__ And what's really interesting, Louis, about your books is that you, in fact, reach into the past and kind of re-imagine the past, and in that way, create a new kind of mystery novel. __EOS__ For instance, in ""Mr. Timothy,"" you kind of re-imagine what might have to happen to Tiny Tim had he lived on.

119," We actually started off filming in more than just those three countries. And over time, while we watched the various revolutions change and we witnessed the ways the sort of legacy media outlets were covering the stories, we all decided to pick stories that weren't being told actually as much other ones. So Bahrain obviously has been nicknamed - and I'm sure there are comments about this - The Forgotten Revolution.__EOS__ Maryam, you know, it's very difficult for me in my comfortable home here in the United States to imagine being put in the kind of position to make the decisions that you've made. You and your family, through multiple arrests, through beatings - I mean, your father was tortured - and I wonder when you're weighing personal safety, not just personal safety but your entire family's safety, how you decide that that calculation is still worth it, I mean, especially seeing what's happened in Syria? How do you still keep moving forward?__EOS__ Well, I mean, I think to some extent, it's because we grew up with that kind of mindset. I mean, my father has been through so much. I remember from 2001 until 2011, I saw my father coming home numerous times with marks of beatings on his back. And I always posed the same question to him is why do you continue doing what you're doing when the outcome is not what you want it to be?

And I think the idea that America - that you could somehow find common cause with the great Satan - was the most problematic part of the piece, that the idea that Iranians and Americans are, you know, similar on the scale of humanity.__EOS__ That's interesting.

What strikes me there is that, of course, pride in one's child is beautiful. But you can have pride in a marriage, too, that doesn't have to be destructive. __EOS__ Sandra, oh, go ahead, I'm sorry.

126," Mishka, I love you. Mishka, I love you. Mishka...__EOS__ ....I love you.__EOS__ I love you.__EOS__ I love you.",3
127," Yeah, exactly.__EOS__ And you have the built-in narrative drive of the season. Practice, game one, game two and so on and so forth and interweaving the stories within those - within that structures of the sports season.__EOS__ Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, that was, you know, that was another reason that we decided to kind of focus on the team, because it did give us an inherent beginning, middle and an end. But, you know, for us, it was never about the football. And hopefully, when audiences see it, they realize that it's, you know, football is the lens that we're - that we enter the story on, but it's definitely not what the film is about.__EOS__ Yeah, the themes are much more universal. I mean, we're really exploring ideas of, you know, themes of fatherhood, you know, themes of, you know, a lot of subtext is resilience. You know, the, you know, and really exploring the world of the haves and have-nots through the conduit of football.",1
128," Marco and Celia first meet when she auditions for the circus, and he realizes that she may be more than just a master of illusion. __EOS__  No one is watching her except Marco as she stands perfectly still on the stage, waiting patiently. And then very slowly, her gown begins to change. Starting at the neckline, seeping down like ink, the green silk is turning a murky midnight black. Marco gasps. Chandresh and Madame Padva turned at the sound just in time to witness the creeping black fade into snow-bright white at the bottom of the skirt until all evidence that the gown was ever green is gone. __EOS__ As mind boggling as Marco and Celia's tricks may be, Morgenstern says their magic goes only so far in helping them to shape their own destiny. __EOS__ The phrase nothing is impossible comes up a lot. I think I wanted to play with that a little bit and have that there were limits to what could be done, like, that there's a life and death sort of aspect, that they can't fix certain things. ",0
129," Yeah. ""The Big Lebowski"" might be the all-time favorite, though.__EOS__ That's great.__EOS__ And ""Schindler's List.""__EOS__ Well, we are Jews.",1
130," My father said, you are not marrying my daughter until after she has that baby. You are never gonna be able to say that you had to marry her, because you don't. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ We will take care of her. __EOS__ I was not exactly the most stand up person at that time, but I said, look, I want marry her and that's it. ",3
131," It may turn out, judged from what we're learning from the British and the Australians, that separating kids temporarily, not totally sex-segregated education, but to have special classes for girls and boys. It may be the way to go, and in fact far from being something from the past it may be cutting-edge, and we're seeing lots of good effects with special reading and writing classes for boys, and math and science classes for girls.__EOS__ Just briefly, before we take our break, and I believe you're going to stay with us and we're happy about that, but your book, ""The War Against Boys,"" came out 12 years ago. It was subtitled, ""How Misguided Feminism is Harming Our Young Men."" I know you've changed the subtitle for an upcoming edition, but I have to ask has your attitude changed? I mean, is it your view that feminism is the problem. Or is it - what is - is it that feminism is the problem here?__EOS__ Yeah, I never meant to indict the feminist movement. I meant misguided, sort of hard-lined male intolerant feminism, but I don't think most feminists are that way. And I think that that subtitle led many people to just close their mind to the message of my book. And so I certainly didn't want to do that. So I've changed it to, ""How Misguided Policies,"" and I think there are many policies that are harming young men and it's not the fault of feminists.__EOS__ You have two boys yourself?",3
132," I've seen it 710, I think. __EOS__ Okay. __EOS__ No, I've only seen it only once, I think. __EOS__ It's too embarrassing. I don't want to watch it again. It's also ruined my life. ",1
133," Yeah.__EOS__ Well, I interviewed him a few years ago. You want to hear what he had to say about ""Annie""?__EOS__ Yes. Please. Please.__EOS__ Yeah, okay. I mean, about ""Hard Knock Life""? Okay. So this is Charles Strouse, who wrote the music for ""Annie,"" talking about Jay-Z's version of ""Hard Knock Life."" And here's what he had to say about it.",0

His most recent CD is called ""Ovunque Proteggi"" or May You Protect Me Everywhere. __EOS__ Grazie. __EOS__ You can hear Signore Capossela perform the ""Medusa Cha Cha Cha,"" hear whole tracks and discover new music at npr.org/music). __EOS__ It's a perfect day. It's a sunny day. I'm on my own, whistle, wave, buy a cocktail with an umbrella. The sky is near enough to touch, clouds of perfumed water. The dreamy air kisses me because it's a perfect day. ",2
135," Fred Hersch is happy to be back at the Vanguard, where his photograph has earned a permanent place on one of the green, felt-covered walls. __EOS__ It's above Coltrane, and next to Bill Evans and catty-corner from Mingus, and not that I, in my wildest dreams, think that I'm at that level as an artist. __EOS__ Some might say he's pretty close. __EOS__ He has a loving, beautiful way of creating nuance from the piano. ",2
136," Well, I'm starting to see notes fly out. __EOS__ There you go. And I'm guessing from that recording that that timpani player is using pretty hardheaded sticks with hard felt and not the soft, mushy, spongy sticks. __EOS__ Now, why did that cause such an uproar? __EOS__ Well, I don't think anybody had ever heard such a thing in the opera house before, just with naked snare rolls. I think it was quite revolutionary. ",2
137," In 1918, he runs into Anne Vanderbilt, and she becomes very interested in yoga. And such wonderful things happened to the Vanderbilt family through their relationship with Bernard that she ended up bankrolling part of his move to Nyack, New York, where he began to buy land and set up what is basically the first established American ashram. __EOS__ Your description of the Clarkstown Country Club certainly does not sound like an ashram. It sounds more like something that resembled a circus, with elephants and baseball games played in drag, and so on. Describe what it was like. __EOS__ Well, the cream of the crop of American society was interested in Bernard's teachings. There were heiresses from wealthy families, a great war spy named Sir Paul Dukes. There were attorneys, and Bernard put on professional grade circuses and vaudeville entertainments that lasted from tea in the afternoon until dawn. And he did all of this out of a belief that this was part of becoming a well-rounded person. __EOS__ Given that yoga is now a multibillion dollar industry - some call it the yoga industrial complex - do you think Pierre Bernard would be proud of what it has become? ",3
138," All of it. And it's just something about the way we, as performers from this city, the way we do things. We hear extra sounds in our heads, extra beats, extra backbeats, extra rhythms that people from other parts of the United States just don't understand or get. __EOS__  Another man done gone. Another man done gone. Another man done gone. He had to leave his home. Another man done gone. __EOS__ The phrasing, it just sounds so much like New Orleans in particular. And as a female vocalist, Irma is the epitome of that. __EOS__  Another storm has come... ",2
139," Glad to be here. __EOS__ So paint a picture of the first Thanksgiving for us. It wasn't a table with fancy fixings and a turkey and some golden turret was it? __EOS__ It was pretty rustic. It was more like I think an outside barbeque than a sit down dinner. __EOS__ Okay. So I guess in my head I picture the English sitting on one side of the table and the Native Americans sitting on the other side of the table and everyone breaking bread together, but not so much. ",3
140," Yeah, it was a time in my life where I was depressed and didn't know what depression was. And I was disengaged with tennis. I woke up in a life that I realized it wasn't mine, I wasn't connected to. I hated what I did. I was in a marriage I didn't want to be in. And I was depressed and somebody came along and offered me an escape and, and I took it. And for a moment there was vast sadness. __EOS__ Were there consequences for you your assistant who you kind of ratted out in your letter, you've said that he used meth and, that, you know, he spiked his drink that you accidentally drank? __EOS__ He had already kind of fallen off the radar. He was gone. But I watched that drug rip his life apart. He was in a rehab and was, had already publicly sort of confessed to his circle that he was, you know, dying with this addiction. And so, there was nothing private about that part of it. But, you know, in the book I sort of refer him as Slim, which was also deliberate. __EOS__ To hide his real name. ",0
141," OK.__EOS__ I think a lot of your fans would be surprised to find out that your mother was mentally ill. You found this out later. You weren't even being raised by her. At a certain point, you were being raised by an aunt who you thought was your mother. And then your mother shows up one day, for reasons that you're still not clear on, and then took you to live at a group home.__EOS__ It wasn't a group home; it was a convent.__EOS__ Convent.",0
142," Well, derogatory way. I mean, they're actually called - forgive me - Rhineland bastards by the Gestapo, made to wear black stars. That doesn't all happen in your novel, but still, this really beguiling young trumpeter, Hieronymus, he speaks German.__EOS__ Yes. He's a German citizen, born and raised in that area and so - yeah. He is very much a German and this is how he would, you know, identify himself if questioned. But, of course, you know, in this kind of horribly fraught regime, he's other.__EOS__ He's other. And they have to escape and they don't all make it out. We won't say who does and who doesn't. But did you write some of this novel in Germany?__EOS__ I did, but only, you know, in the very final drafts. The novel was conceived because I was living in Germany. I was in southern Germany for over a year starting in 2006. I had an artist fellowship there and so just being a black woman in Germany, I started to think about the history of African people or people of African descent in Germany and, you know, started doing some research and found some - you know, not many, but - you know, a few terrific sources that gave whole histories.",0
143," Dispatches from China's Most Popular Literary Star .""__EOS__ Not so long ago, many Chinese commentators wrote in a cautious, oblique style designed not to offend the nation's famously humorless leaders. Then came the Internet, blogs and a cheeky young man named Han Han. The voice of China's post-'80s generation, Han was ironic, skeptical and blunt. He wrote what many young Chinese thought, but dared not say publicly.__EOS__ I participated in quite a few essay competitions. Before each event, I had to brainwash myself and check to see what slogans were in fashion.__EOS__ Han on the rule of law.",0
144," So I was going to - I wanted to acknowledge that. And I wanted to acknowledge and glory in all of the different creators, all of the different aspects of Batman, including the original Batman movie, including the most recent versions, including Neal Adams, a wonderful Batman artist, and you know, the third Neal to be mentioned on this show who also didn't spell his name correctly. He spelled it like Neal Conan. __EOS__ Neal Adams who re-imaged, who gave us the longer, pointer ears, the more swirlingy cloak, he put Batman back at night back in the '70s and essentially made him cool again after the Adam West version of Batman had had un-cooled him ultimately. So I got to try and say - talk about how much I loved all of those things and of course have essentially the same format that Alan had, which is you get the last issue with that numbering of your comic. But I don't think that you could look at them as being the same kind of thing at all. __EOS__ I asked this question to the man who did so much with the Sandman. Is Batman the most interesting character in comics? __EOS__ I've never thought of any character as being the most interesting character in comics. I don't there is the most interesting character in comics because the truth is, characters are as good as you write them. And the glory of great characters and the glory of great writers and creators is that point where you put a wonderful creator on a second, third, fourth or even a fifth-string character and suddenly you have Frank Miller doing Daredevil and everybody going, oh, Daredevil was such a great character, or Alan Moore doing something who was just considered a joke. ",0
145," Did you actually have a choice, like yes I want to be a star, so make me a star?__EOS__ Well, I think what they meant by that was would I be game to go and do, you know, the massive amounts of promotion, would I be game to go and be photographed and this, that and the other and, you know, did I want to get out there, basically, into the media.__EOS__ Let me tell you, I see a lot of movies, and I'm so often frustrated. I mean, there's so many movies that aren't very good, and I guess you must feel that, too, as an actress, that there's a lot of stuff out there that you don't feel is worth your time.__EOS__ Some of I read, and I think why?",1
146," Oh.__EOS__ And it was like, ow! She was hit like that. And it happened to be that her - the glass of her spectacles broke, but thank God she had nothing in her eye. Because you don't want to go to a concert and come with one eye out of the concert, right? But it's sometimes very dangerous. Yeah.__EOS__ Have you ever hurt yourself?__EOS__ Oh, very many, many times.",2
147," Oh, there was salt. __EOS__ I'm thinking about that song Suitcase. Don't put too much salt in those black eyed peas. When we listen to your music, what other musical influences do we hear? __EOS__ Well, I was listening to popular music. I wasn't all that eclectic, you know, but because I played in a calypso band and we played steel drums, we were playing calypso music, so we were playing Latin-influenced music from the Caribbean. We listened to jazz records. Mongo Santa Maria was my favorite. A couple of us had little cheap conga drums that we had managed to scrounge up that we would just have our, like, little drum sessions out on my front porch. So we would just sit there, me and George Simpkins and Carlos County lived down the street, and the Thurman boys, they lived across the street. And we would just sit and bang out drums, you know, figuring it out, you know? Yeah. __EOS__ See. So in a sense I guess I was having tribal experience, not knowing what it was, really, you know, and then coming to the blues. ",2
148," Struck a chord with me? I don't know.__EOS__ Just struck a chord with you. You remember?__EOS__ I just wrote the song. I wasn't thinking about it. I was just writing it. I'm not that deep. I'm not deep.__EOS__ Oh, OK.",2
149,"  Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans, way back up in the woods among the evergreens, there stood a log cabin made of earth and wood, where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode... __EOS__ The amazing thing about ""Johnny B. Goode"" to me is that it sounds like a folk song. It sounds like a song that came out of the generations, just honed over generations, not written by an individual, and yet it's written by an individual. __EOS__  He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack, go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track... __EOS__ Sort of the apex of it to me, the apex of Chuck Berry's songwriting, because it sounds so natural, just something that any one who was the greatest songwriters of any generation would be proud of.

Alex Rodriquez is the runner on first. His teammate hits a pop-up foul ball down the third baseline. A-Rod has almost made it to third base. He's heading back to first and he takes the shortest possible route, I guess, which takes him right across the pitcher's mound. Breach of etiquette, what do you think? __EOS__ Yup. ",3
151," Of course. __EOS__ I'm happy there. It's just there are certain moments and things and mainly just love-related things that make me periodically sad. And I'm happy that I have the ability to write about them. __EOS__ Yeah. You're brought your guitar along, right? __EOS__ Yes. ",2
152," I remember it all. __EOS__ Okay. So with all that great stuff on the bookshelves and the Weavers on the turntable, it must've really helped you fall in love with books. __EOS__ It helped me fall in love with the whole world, except for sports... __EOS__ But do you know what I mean? It's just - the world was all there. I loved books but I loved art, I loved - you know, and it was all there for the taking. And, you know, children are sponges, and I was incredibly lucky to have such extraordinary stuff to soak up. Yeah, it really did. ",3
153," Actually, I would say perhaps not. I have written only two books that feature people that could even be remotely described as serial killers, and I hear it's pretty close to the real-life description, which is not a super-genius, Hannibal Lecter-type person, but usually a person of slightly below-average IQ, but possibly with a sense of being more intelligent, more powerful than he is. And it usually is a he. There have been very few female serial killers.__EOS__ Laura Lippman joined us from member station WYPR in Baltimore. Thanks very much for your time.__EOS__ Thank you for having me.__EOS__ Rob Cohen with us from NPR West in Culver City, California. Thank you.",1
154," Yeah. __EOS__ As you travel about, do you feel that Islamists are gaining more power and influence, day by day? __EOS__ Well, I think they are, now, the only organized force, so they are gaining ground while the other parties - the parties of the young people and others who made the - triggered the Revolution - are just about starting their own parties. And that's also one of the reasons I believe that having the election in September is way too soon, because you would not have a level playing field at that time. The new parties are not yet fully engaged. __EOS__ Now, let me ask you about this book, which I'll mention is called ""The Age of Deception,"" and it covers what I guess we can now think of as your previous life - running the International Atomic Energy Agency at a really momentous period, involving Iraq - U.S. invasion of Iraq, the Iran issue. You are working on issues relating to Libya, relating to North Korea. ",0
155," temperature shifts, barometric shifts and so on.__EOS__ Wow. Sounds like something I'd see on ""Masterpiece Theatre.""__EOS__ They are - you're right. They're amazingly traumatic. But there are - the grasp of their height and so on, and the instrument readings all exist. And as I say, this produced...__EOS__ Yeah.",0
156," Toes? Wait. What does toes have to do with Oedipus?__EOS__ Well, you know, he had a foot, right? He had a foot issue, old Oedipus.__EOS__ He did?__EOS__ Didn't he have a broken foot or something like that?",0
157," Yeah. They are constantly kind of making political deals, you know, to kind of backtrack and not give the Freedom Riders the full support of the federal government. So they actually - to get out of the church, they make a deal with the governor of Alabama. They finally forced John Patterson to sign out - to sign the document that will call out the National Guard. So it seems like it's the governor of Alabama who's actually doing it. __EOS__ We're talking with Stanley Nelson, who's the director, writer and producer of a new film called ""Freedom Riders,"" that premieres Monday, May 16th on PBS series ""American Experience."" Also with us is former Freedom Rider Ernest ""Rip"" Patton. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. __EOS__ Yeah. In the film, it was actually Julian Bond who says it. I mean, you know, you don't want violence to happen outright. But, you know, doesn't that then bring publicity to our cause? You know, doesn't that heighten what we're doing, if something does happen? You know, if the Freedom Riders had been able to just ride through the South and get to New Orleans and the South kind of ignored them, then what would have happened? So as Julian puts it, you know, in some ways it's good for our cause if something happens. But you know, nowhere did they in any way imagine that the violence would be the violence that did happen. __EOS__ And I wonder, Rip Patton, younger person at that time, did you think nothing would happen? ",1
158," Rayid, thank you. __EOS__ Yeah, can I just follow up? I'm curious  Is it a matter of journalists being intimidated to ask the question, or are they simply not doing due diligence in educating themselves about the issues? __EOS__ Well, there's been some world-class journalism on this subject. Right here in the United States, Gretchen Morgenson of the New York Times has a new book out today on the subject of what happened at Fannie Mae. __EOS__ two parties, they're the best we can do, let's live with them. ",0
159," Why? __EOS__ He couldn't understand what this war fever was about. I think he had common sense. But he was the loser. As society got swept up, he was the guy who lost out. __EOS__ So let's figure out the drama here. Theodore Roosevelt isn't president yet. He's assistant secretary of the Navy, and there's this tremendous debate building in the country about what to do. How did the drama play out? __EOS__ Well, Teddy Roosevelt, as assistant secretary of the Navy, did his best to get us into the war. He had the fleet ready to go take on the Spanish. He was constantly lobbying McKinley, and they were putting pressure. They were war hawks. ",0
160," Absolutely. __EOS__ ...and beam ourselves somewhere. __EOS__ I wish we could. Every time I'm in an airport terminal, I wish I could. __EOS__ This is our place, this is our place, and we'd better take care of it. And sometimes, of course, you can be disgruntled. In a way, for example, I've worked in the jungle, and after real hardship I came to the conclusion  Yes, I love the jungle, however against my better judgment. But... ",0
161,"  I'm so hoping you didn't drink it. __EOS__  Oh.  But I so did it. __EOS__  Oh, dear. __EOS__  After I drank it, I was sitting there and I didn't even feel buzzed, high, nothing, and I was like, OK, maybe I just - let me stand up, you know.  OK, so I stand up and I absolutely have no - it has no effect on me, and right then and there I got scared to death and I said, you have my attention, Lord. What are you trying to tell me?   ",2
162," And Gertrude Ward was a really good example of that. __EOS__  Oh, swing low, chariot. I said, swing low, chariot... __EOS__ And, I mean, this was kind of a tough life. I mean, she didn't just let them sing in church and in community performances. She uprooted them - took them out of school and moved them to Vegas. __EOS__ She was so controlling. You know, some people think that she was so controlling, that she may have stressed Clara so much, that she, you know, died at a lot younger age than she, you know, necessarily would have. ",1
163," Yeah.__EOS__ ...but family nevertheless.__EOS__  The Lightning Express from the depot so grand had started out on its way...__EOS__ ""Lightning Express"" is just this little boy who's trying to get to his mother, and he doesn't have enough money to pay the fare for the train.",2
164, .__EOS__ He sings about blue-collar guys who dream of parties and alcohol and women. He also does something more.__EOS__ Many of his tunes are known as Narco-Corridos; that's the name for ballades that tell stories of the drug trade. Authorities have been cracking down on those songs.__EOS__ Which is why El Komander says he's quitting. NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports.,2
165," She had a way of carrying herself and an aura about her of strength that made it surprising that somebody who had such a strong personality would get in a situation like a recording situation and be really shy and intimidated by the whole thing. __EOS__ It's a contradiction that Dalton isn't around to resolve. She died in 1993. And if she gave any recorded interviews, they apparently don't survive. The mystery that surrounds her life may be part of the reason for her recent comeback.  __EOS__ Let's play that.  __EOS__ In the last two years, independent labels have put out three CDs' worth of reissued and unreleased material. ",2
166," Oh, I would think it would be the bible of almost everybody. __EOS__ It does sound that the Internet here is - if not the ideal medium, the only medium I can imagine for such a work. You couldn't have a book this large or an encyclopedia, so… __EOS__ No, you can't. And the Internet is one of the technological keys to this whole project. We wouldn't have been able to think about this very seriously 20 years ago. Maybe it will still seem like a - well, it still seems like a dream 10 years ago when I started writing about it. The electronic encyclopedia - I remember one very prominent British colleague and a friend of mine wrote me when he saw an article I've written Ion this. What are you smoking, Ed? Well, now I hope that I can persuade in my lesson smoking anything. __EOS__ Well, Professor Wilson, thank you every much for talking with us about it. Good to talk to you again. ",0
167," In a way, when I was a kid, you know, not everybody looked at me in sixth grade and thought  Oh, he must be gay because he likes musicals and he's arty and airy-fairy. They looked at me and thought weirdo. And now you look at - they would look at me and think faggot and come after me for that reason, or more intensely. __EOS__ Now Dan, as you put it earlier, you're married in Canada and boyfriends in...  ...in the U.S. So I guess you had to go... __EOS__ Which we've actually turned into an acronym, husband in Canada, HIC, boyfriend in America, BIA, so he's my HICBIA now. __EOS__ That's because you couldn't get married in America?

168," That's the first time these two meet, and it's your first glimpse of Stone Cresson, a disturbed and disturbing man. Edward Norton plays him with prison tattoos and cornrows and eyes so cold with malice it makes the hairs on your neck stand up. __EOS__ Thanks. Good to be here. __EOS__ Let me just let listeners in a little bit on what happens in the plot so they can follow this. __EOS__ Yeah. ",1

They have done pretty well, but, you know, again, that's -one of Chrysler's corporation issues is that pickup trucks and SUVs have fallen off quite a bit, and taken this company with them a little bit. __EOS__ Here's an email we got from Steve in Monte Claire. Best care ever - 65 Plymouth Valiant with a slant six. One of those in Mexico in the late '80s early '90s, the place was teaming one time. A Mexican cop stop may not for the usual reason, but because he wanted to buy my beautiful Valiant.  I told him. I guess that's going back a little ways. __EOS__ Well, I think  a genius, you know. Absolutely, it was a fantastic car. The Valiant was awesome. __EOS__ Here's another email. This one from Richard. I'm a 37-year-old car owner of an import car shop. My family bought a 2004 Chrysler Pacifica in 2005. We love this vehicle. Dual climate control that works, four heated seats, navigation in front with the driver, all wheel drive, power tailgate, an excellent audio system with a rear DVD, wireless with headsets that lets those in front to what we want to, decent mileage, side curtain airbags, the third seats fall down for the dogs to go to work, comfortable for six. America can build a great vehicle if they try. ",3

172," It was the early 2000s. Social media was exploding. The Mexican drug war was escalating. Sinaloan kids were sharing music with LA kids. Omar says it was the perfect storm.__EOS__ Today Narco-Corridos are a multi-million dollar businesses. Dave Gaddis is a retired regional director for the DEA in Mexico.__EOS__ There are public relations campaigns by these cartels in order to establish a certain level of popularity, and I believe that some of these Corridos actually help them do that.__EOS__ It's commonly thought that these songs are commissioned by the drug lords. But El Komander says he has no ties to any cartel.",2
173," Yes. That's definitely true. It actually is uncomfortable. Because you have a shortened tendon, it will feel tighter when you walk barefoot, or even in flats, if you are used to wearing high heels. So if you have been wearing high heels for years and years and decide that you want to go to flats, then you need - as with someone switching to barefoot running - you need to do it gradually.__EOS__ So let's talk about dealing with muscle soreness, the kind of soreness that can set in with overexertion or with, you know, a rigorous workout routine.__EOS__ That actually surprised me. I hang around with a lot of athletes, and there are many athletes who take that non-steroidal ibuprofen every day.

174,"  ...because they're blown into magazines so that they fall      out and you get--they get noticed.  Yeah, I thought that was one of the      most clever ones; very simple, a guy who just opts not to fill them out,      and at the end of a month or so he mails them back.  And since they're      pre-paid, the advertiser--the magazine gets hit with the expense. __EOS__  A lot of the annoyances that you detail which people try and      combat have to do with the telephone and telephone marketers.  In the      end, there's not much you can do to break through a phone tree, is there? __EOS__  The one tactic I did come up with for that was someone who      had found if you press the non-English option, often you get an operator      who does speak English, and you get one much more quickly than if you      follow the road you're supposed to follow. __EOS__  Of all of these strategies for fighting back that you pass along,      is there one that you find the most appealing or that people seem to      respond to the most?

I mean, when you're dead you don't know, and I know where I'm going and I would be well dressed. __EOS__ When you say you know where you're going, you mean the graveyard. __EOS__ To the, not to the afterlife. To the... __EOS__ Not the afterlife. Right. ",1
177," And he wants to go back.__EOS__ Yeah, Nathan is still an active duty Marine in the Wounded Warriors Regiment. And the only thing he wants to do is go back. He wants to be a leader of men. But he eventually realizes that he's not going to be able to do that. And so Ashley, I think, in one way is relieved. But at the same time, I think they both wonder, well, what is he going to do?__EOS__ Danfung Dennis, thank you very much for joining us.__EOS__ Thank you so much for having me.",1
178,"  Half the men in Napa Valley have been in the bloom of your life.__EOS__ So as we heard in that clip, there's a lot of laughter in this series. And in the scene that we heard, there was, like, laughter after every single line. __EOS__ I know.__EOS__ And is that - is that all laughter from the audience? Is there a laugh track to you? Is the laughter sweetened?",3
179," Hmm. Thanks, Bruce. __EOS__ Thank you very much. __EOS__ Bye-bye. And let's see if we can talk with Mason. Mason calling us from Manchester, New Hampshire. __EOS__ Yes, sir. You mentioned that some of his paragraphs that he wrote, people would have a hard time, that they were messy and sort of all over the place. How did that get by the editors? And did the editors ever try to shape him and refine his work? ",0
180," Now, correct me if I'm wrong. Your grandparents were both - your grandmothers were both from Italy? __EOS__ Yeah. My mother's side of the family was from Campania, south of Naples, and my father's side was from Abruzzo, which is east of Rome, in a little Adriatic town called Vasto, which I've seen pictures of in 1905 when they came over. You would have emigrated too. __EOS__ Now, it's a quite - now, it's quite a fashionable resort for the Germans and the Austrians who just come right down the coast. But it was not a nice place to be back then. It was poverty-stricken as all of these southern Italian towns were. __EOS__ So sometimes I ask musicians to redeem a song - to take a song they love but that other people think of as square or corny or sentimental, and they're often criticized for loving the song. I'm going to ask you to redeem a food, to take a food that is mighty unpopular, but you think is really quite good. ",0

The SEALs carried them safely to Djibouti, and then to a military base in Italy.

I don't think either one of us could have handled any more.__EOS__ No. I mean, inside of yourself, you want to talk about everything. But I think that one hour, you're able to kind of relay the main message that you love each other, and that whatever has happened during these 93 days, we have the rest of our lives to talk about it.__EOS__ Some of the experts seem to worry about your marriage surviving this, and talked about that there's experiences with relationships never being the same after something like this.",0
182," And he comes into this room - and I don't know what this room is, but it seems to be raining in the room, and there are dangling chains. And he's trying to find the cat, and he's just, you know, calling for the cat. And it's just - you're just leaning in, you're so fascinated watching this scene. And then, of course the alien, which is now in full form and is over seven feet tall, is behind him, you know, and he just turns around and he sees it.__EOS__ The suspense of what's happening as he's just trying to find that cat is just so unbelievably scary. And the room is amazing, and it's just a great, great moment in cinema. It's really stuck with me.__EOS__ One of the things that we did in ""The Walking Dead"" season premiere was our group comes across a prison, and we designed a set in which they go into dark corridors, you know, trying to clear it out of zombies so they could occupy this prison.__EOS__ I want this to feel like ""Alien."" As the group is going around, I want to just feel claustrophobic. I wanted just a flashlight cutting the darkness. And I was happy that I was finally able to rip off the movie because it's been such a seminal piece for me my whole life.",1
183," You know, you're here in this film playing a guy with young people who are engaged in this romantic fling that, you know, seems familiar, and making mistakes, and you're kind of giving the Jesse Eisenberg character advice from the perspective of experience.__EOS__ Well, I don't think I would ever try to tell people anything about the work they're doing in general, but let alone people who are at that level, because all of them are very experienced. You know, Ellen is someone who's made a lot of films, and she's very successful in the film business, and she's very talented. I mean, it's just apparent when you work with her just how gifted she is and the way she can act in front of a camera.__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ I think all of us turn to each other and say  Do you think he's liking what we're doing? Like Jesse would say  How do you think this is going? And I'd say  I don't know. How do you think it's going? So it's all - it's a little - yeah, Woody is so quiet.

After ""Chicago"" won Best Picture, he sent us some beautiful cufflinks with a note that said  If a picture's worth a thousand words, a joke on the Oscars is worth a million at the box office.

185," Yeah, they didn't want there to be the temptation. __EOS__ But in your case, partition was glass, so you could see everything. __EOS__ Yeah, it was all wishy-washy. This has been very strange. __EOS__ Well how did it work with that partition in place? What did the bartender have to do? ",3
186," That's right. If a stockbroker or a bond trader lost his life or her life in the World Trade Center, getting the family to agree voluntarily not to sue the airlines requires a greater amount of compensation than the waiter or the busboy who might sue - unless they receive a much smaller amount of money based on wages and lifetime economic earnings. So, that helps explain why Congress did that the way they did it. __EOS__ Let's get another caller on the line.

187," This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with the Israeli filmmaker Dror Moreh, whose Oscar-nominated documentary ""The Gatekeepers"" is based on interviews with six former Israeli intelligence chiefs. After spending their careers battling Palestinian militants and tracking down terrorists, they all expressed concerns about continued occupation of Palestinian territories. Moreh also directed a 2008 documentary about former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. I spoke with him Monday, the day after the Academy Awards presentation.__EOS__ No. I was surprised to the extent and to the depth of what they thought about it. You know, when you come to that kind of interviews, about - especially when you speak with security forces head and people that always, you think, saw the enemy through the binocular of the rifle, you think that they will be much more harsh, much more motivated by security questions. And I was surprised and shocked to hear that this is what they thought and this is what they think.__EOS__ As I listen to these officials give their perspectives, I wondered how much of this was new to them, or whether when they were in office or they were engaged in carrying out missions, they thought, hmm, we're on the wrong course here, and whether they ever told that to their, you know, their civilian policymakers. Do you know?__EOS__ It's an amazing question. It's a very important question, what you've asked now. And I've asked that question to each one of them  Why didn't you say those words when you were in office? So the question I would say is a bit complicated, because in one hand, they said, look, those meetings where we were in those offices with the prime minister who is the only and direct boss of the heads of the Shin Bet, we said those words sometimes in shoutings, that this policy will lead to this the that and that consequences, sometimes to bitter consequences.",1
188," So has scholarship brought you any closer to or further from the church?__EOS__ Well, I wouldn't say it's brought me closer to the church. It's made me feel independent of the church, I guess is the way I would put it. Now, I - you know, I think I have a deep attachment to the Catholic Church, because it's - the same way as I do to my native country. You know, it's where I grew up...__EOS__ Which is Ireland.__EOS__ It's - indeed. Yes.",0
189," I do, but I've never used it. And I've never downloaded music either, by the way. I've heard all about it. __EOS__ So, I know you have one more song, and it's from Colombia. And the genre is something called - and I don't know if I'm going to pronounce this correctly - but terapia? __EOS__ Terapia, yeah. It means therapy. It's a kind of music that develops in the dancehalls in coastal Colombia. I've made five trips now to collect music. It's just wonderful stuff and it's an incredible scene. It's outdoors, it's 120 degrees, it's sweating, hot. They have no midrange speakers anywhere, but these giant four-by-six-foot bass speakers all around.

191,"  A classy strip. __EOS__  Classy strip, yeah.  And he said, `You can do this.  You      can start off with, you know, with Chopin.'  He had--Don had a great      voice.  `You can play Chopin or one of those guys, and then just stand up      and let it rip.' And I put the whole act together and on opening      night--it was at the Chateau de Ville Dinner Theatre in Framingham,      Massachusetts--opening night I was terrified.  You know, I was--five      minute before I went on I was still trying to figure out how to take off      my bra gracefully. __EOS__  With one hand. __EOS__  With one hand, yeah.  And I was in the wings with Danny      Herman, my stage manager, and he said to me, `OK,' you know, `stay      calm. Everything's fine.'  And the lights went to black, the comedians      ran off the stage and in the wings on the other side of the stage I      noticed two policemen with dogs on leashes.  And I said, `Danny, why are      the policemen over there with dogs?'  And he said, `Oh, well, you know,      they're just here just in case.'  And I said, `In case what?'  And he      said, `If you actually show anything, they'll arrest you.'  And yeah, we      had everything timed so I played the final glissando on the piano and      ripped my bra off exactly when the blackout occurred. ",2
192," Yeah. And it was a pretty extraordinary moment. And I think that kind of sums up their whole case. They didn't have a case. They had no option but to walk out. They've managed to successfully delay the hearing three times. And on the fourth time and the final hearing, they had no case to answer. So they had no choice but to walk out. But it was great for us as filmmakers to be in there at the court at the time and actually witness that. __EOS__ Well, I mean, I think they did have a choice and - but they chose to do that. And that shows an extraordinary level of disrespect for law, for international law. And that kind of sets a mark. And it was an incredibly thing to capture that on film because I don't think it happens very often. __EOS__ Then they utterly ignore the courts rulings. And, of course, Zimbabwe is a signatory to the SADC. And then the next scene we see is a still photograph of Mount Carmel burning. __EOS__ Yeah. I mean, it's tragic what happened to the farm, the farm workers and to the family themselves since that day of that — the final court case, when they won their case. Well, I don't want to giveaway too much to viewers who might tune in tonight and watch the film, but it's tragic what's happened to them as a family and them as a farm. But it symbolizes what's happened across the border in Zimbabwe. Blacks and whites, millions of people, have been forced into this situation with Robert Mugabe's regime and in particular the land reform. ",1

194," Yeah. Disney is not this sanitized place that you might imagine it to be. I mean, they hired Ashman and Menken after they did ""Little Shop of Horrors"" which was sort of the ""Avenue Q"" of its day.

And I don't think Disney has any problem with employing people who have, you know, done off color stuff in the past.__EOS__ Right.",1
195,"  Sometime when youve lost someone... __EOS__ Did your father encourage you to do this? __EOS__ There was a slight sort of  Are you really going to bang your head against the wall and live out of a suitcase, and be an artist? Because, of course, being a traveling singer had a price for my father. You know? I mean he was married four times, divorced three times and he sort of coined the phrase  Absence makes the heart go to wander. __EOS__ But you went at it anyway. I bet they, your father and mother, hoped you'd outgrow all of this. ",2
196," And your latest work is directing ""Precious."" __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ You've taken - among other things - you've cast Mo'Nique, the actress and talk show host, you've cast Mariah Carey in this film, you cast a young obese woman in the starring role as Precious - you know, a lot of really unlikely choices that all really work. __EOS__ I don't know what other directors do. I can only tell you what I do. I don't believe in a rehearsal process at all. It's more of a therapy session. They need to understand me, you know, so my rehearsal period is really me talking about my insecurities, my fears, my hopes, my dreams, sex, food, literature, gossip, music... ",1
197," Let's take a call from Catherine in Fresno, California. Welcome to TALK OF THE NATION, Catherine.  __EOS__ Thank you. My comment was maybe a little off your topic, but I think it's worth noting. I teach high school, and Fresno, California, is a very diverse community. My classroom, in my high school - have mostly Asian, largely Hmong, students and mostly Mexican students, with a few Caucasian kids mixed in here and there. And I make up, typically, one of maybe four white people in the classroom at a given time. What we have talked through the history, the kids often ask why on earth did they care that someone was black or that someone was Jewish, or that someone was this or that? Young people of today literally don't take account of it. It doesn't occur to them that that's part of the measure of what's going on. __EOS__ Catherine, thanks for your call. Randall Kennedy, do you see that - that as generations start to change over, that some of these issues just are kind of aging themselves out? __EOS__ Absolutely. I mean, social scientists have taken a look at racial attitudes, and racial attitudes have changed dramatically, and they have a generational component to them. On the other hand, I don't think that we should fall prey to naivete. The fact of the matter is even amongst younger people, you know, there is racial prejudice. And that's going to, unfortunately, hang on for a good long while. ",0
198," Mm. He orders the plane to take off again, and where does it go? __EOS__ He wants the plane to go to Mexico City. And people thought, well, that's crazy. You know, under the way that he wanted the plane to fly, it was a tremendous drag, so it would have to refuel in Reno, Nevada. So around midnight, the plane landed in Reno, the aft stairs dangling in the back, sparks flew, and FBI agents raided this plane. And one of the things they found when they went into the mall of the cabin was that some things were missing. One of them was a parachute, all the money and him. __EOS__ And him. He was not on the plane when it landed in Reno to refuel. So somewhere between Seattle and Reno, Nevada that night, the man who became known as D. B. Cooper, this hijacker, escaped. And the presumption is he jumps out of the plane with the parachute and escapes, makes an escape. At that point, what does the FBI do? __EOS__ The manhunt began that morning, and it was an epic manhunt that followed, I mean, one of the biggest in the nation's history. And one of the first things they tried to do, in addition to figuring out who he was, was where he landed. Now, this area of terrain to search is some of the most remote, if not the most remote in this country. It is where Big Foot lives. ",0
199," Yeah, it is broken I think, Steve. You know, this is with a system that was built in 1970. Lots of things happened in the last 40 years. Lots of countries now have that ability to develop nuclear weapon or have the know-how to develop nuclear weapons. So the weapon states need to send the message loud and clear; and not just a message, but act on it, walk the walk, that they are moving towards a world free from nuclear weapons. If you are not going to do that, in the long term, you cannot have a system of security based on nuclear haves and nuclear-have nots. The system of security, based on nuclear deterrence, is an absolute way to self-destruct. __EOS__ Mohammed ElBaradei is the author of ""The Age of Deception.""
