Oh, God. OK. The court says that I'm not supposed to say anything, but I would be, like, totally negligent if I didn't tell you that you really have to watch yourself when you're alone with Daddy, OK?__EOS__  Margo was there.__EOS__  Margo? You mean our Margo? Margo who was at our house, that Margo? Do you have a nice room at Daddy's?",1,,1," You analyze the lyrics and then you realize, Oh, a tune like telling just don't think about the future. Just don't talk about that. Let's just enjoy now.__EOS__ Signs of unstable times, that Zhang says still resonate in today's China.__EOS__ There's nothing guaranteed, you know. Mentally, you're very pressured in a way.__EOS__ And that feeling is bound to cross cultures, says Dave Liang, of the Shanghai Restoration Project.",2,,2," storytelling and presenting music with a message. __EOS__ When Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr. came on to the hip-hop scene, it was the beginning of an era, just not his. __EOS__  One, two, three and to the four. Snoop Doggy Dog and Dr. Dre is at the door, Ready to make an entrance so back on up. Because we know we about rip  up. __EOS__ Common broke on to the scene in the early 1990s, just as gangster rap was starting its assault on mainstream America. ",2,,3," Yeah. And so it was the first uncensored prison magazine. You won many awards, including the George Polk Award. And you investigated things that were happening in prison. I mean, it was like a real newspaper, reporting on what was happening inside. How did you know, how did you figure out that that's what you should be doing, that you would be good at it, that you would like it, that you would make a difference? __EOS__ I didn't know that when I started out. All I - what I - what I really wanted to do was tell - put it this way  When I was released off death row, I was released into what then was the bloodiest prison in the nation. And the things I saw, and the way, you know, what I saw going on in that place, I was so shocked and offended, and that's where I just felt that, you know, society doesn't know this. __EOS__ A warden. __EOS__ Yeah, C. Paul Phelps. He thought that a free press could perhaps make a difference. ",0,,4," Classical pianist Vladimir Horowitz, in the 20 years since his death, has only gained in stature as one of the titans of 20th century music. As insecure as he was accomplished, he at once craved the public's rapturous attention then shunned it altogether. __EOS__ Horowitz contracted a private company to cut lacquer disc recordings of all of his Carnegie Hall recitals. They are admittedly not high fidelity, but that's more than amply compensated for by Horowitz's muscular tone and vibrant orchestral palette. __EOS__ Like many great artists, Horowitz suffered from extreme mood swings and even submitted himself to electroshock therapy in the 1960s to alleviate his bipolar symptoms. Later, he would try antidepressants but found that they severely impaired his ability to play music. __EOS__ But there is also unalloyed energy and joy in these recordings, especially when Horowitz is pulling off a brisk, virtuosic run. He achieved his gorgeous tone and singing, swinging sense of melody by keeping his fingers near to the keys, not lifting them off and striking the poor ivories as some showier pianists do. ",2,,5," Do you hear saxophones when you're playing? Do you think saxophone lines of like, you know, sort of like Coltrane?  __EOS__ No, but I think the breathing thing kind of went in there and never stopped. So I tend to take a breath, taking - playing guitar. Whereas, when you hear a lot of rock guitars, they're not really breathing, they're just, there's no pause going on. They're just - they're very concerned if they're not playing. Even if they leave a bar empty for the drums to go by they seem to, you know, especially in the last 30 years, where you have this kind of speed guitar player who just doesn't stop.  __EOS__ You seemed impressed with the improvisatory nature of jazz? __EOS__ Yeah. To me it was a kind of classical music that you didn't write down. You just stepped up and played, and that was really appealing to me. ",2,,6," They had some pretty strong ideas. They had some pretty strong ideas about their own faith and their own virtue, and the virtue of their own faith. So these people who founded Massachusetts, they were seeking religious liberty, and they were complaining about the persecutions they suffered in England. And of course, the first thing they do when they get to Massachusetts is persecute others and persecute their religions.__EOS__ So, so many settlers in the colonies were Protestants from England. How did religion come into play in the justification of the Revolutionary War, which was going to be fought against fellow Protestants?__EOS__ That's a great question, and historians still argue a lot about religion and the American Revolution. I argue in the book that religion provided some of the core ideas for a lot of the people who would become founders and certainly the people who fought against British rule.__EOS__ How do you think the idea of separation of church and state has evolved over time?",0,,7,"  I have to. And I'm not gonna.__EOS__  Well, we got to. Otherwise we're dead. They're just going to have to go back down the same way they come. Come on.__EOS__  Just one clear shot. That's all I want.__EOS__  Come on.",3,,8," Ugh.__EOS__ What happened? When was that?__EOS__ I think I was like 20 years old. It was in Florida. It was the second season. I worked at this restaurant and I remember watching the first season and being like, well, I'll go try out for ""American Idol."" Why not, you know? My dad and I drove to Miami - I lived in St. Petersburg at the time. And we stood in line for I think 27 hours.__EOS__ After three notes.",2,,9," And that's the movement which has most to do with hell and with judgment and the terror. And he has but a few lines from that and then he moves on. __EOS__ The other interesting thing that scholars would debate about is in one text, the original text, in Latin reads  Deliver the souls of all faithful departed. And Faure eliminates the word faithful, so deliver the souls of all departed, somewhat say that wasn't an oversight. He meant to make a statement by that. __EOS__ That certainly the statement the church means to make. November 11th is Veterans Day here in the U.S. and celebrated at Episcopal Churches around the world as a day to remember the casualties of war. __EOS__ And during the Falkland's War when Mrs. Thatcher want a triumphful service, it wasn't a ""Requiem"" but the dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, Alan Webster, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, insisted on praying for all the dead - the Argentine dead as well as the British. ",2,,10," They continued to use it in their music for ""We are the Robots"" and ""The Man Machine."" And it sounded perfectly natural in the context of Kraftwerk because they were doing purely electronic music. __EOS__ We're charging our battery and now we're full of energy. We are the robots. We are the robots. We are... __EOS__ You know, it seems to me that from what you're saying, the use of the vocoder started with experimental music - maybe avant-garde music - but then eventually it moved into mainstream with hip-hop, right? __EOS__ It became the voice of electro-funk hip-hop in the early '80s. In particular, Michael Jonzun - he's a disco musician from Boston - recorded perhaps the first entire hip-hop vocoder album, ""Lost in Space,"" which was released in 1983. And the song called ""Pack Jam"" was inspired by his intent to destroy all Pacman, or Pacman machines, because the videogame made him dizzy. ",2,,11," Wild. Wild. __EOS__ There's all these theatrics and dirty like lurching sound. __EOS__ I have an attitude towards these dirty sounds and the grotesque in my shows, and I like to scare people a little, but then to make them feel safe again, and let them go home hugging each other like friends. __EOS__ What do the theatrics add to it like in this song, ""Medusa Cha Cha Cha""? ",2,,12," It was based on - at least in part on a couple of people that we knew growing up. I don't want to say who for obvious reasons. __EOS__ But we added a lot of horrible warm empathy... __EOS__ ...which Fred Melamed, the actor, certainly made hay with. __EOS__ So what did they do that made them insufferable? ",1,,13," Okay. __EOS__ And Dr. Nuland, thank you for your time today. __EOS__ Oh, what a pleasure. __EOS__ Sherwin Nuland is the author of, most recently, ""The Art of Aging  A Doctor's Prescription for Well-Being."" He joined us today from our bureau in Chicago. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0,,14," I thought one of the most unusual stories that you heard was told by the mother who sold her child's Social Security number.__EOS__ Some women are able to raise money by letting friends or relatives use their children's Social Security numbers to claim tax credits, and this woman, her sister, I think it was, had promised her $3,000 - had promised her a share of the $3,000 tax credit if she could lend her the Social Security numbers of the kids, and the woman did it but was complaining she didn't get the full sum that she was owed.__EOS__ One of the things that welfare reform was supposed to do was promote a work ethic. Can you evaluate whether that has succeeded?__EOS__ Well, I would say it has succeeded, because low-income since mothers went to work in much greater shares than they ever had before. It was partly the great economy of the late 1990s. It was partly the provision of extra benefits like tax credits and child care that helped people take low-wage jobs. But certainly when you have less access to cash aid, it did prompt more people to go to work.",3,,15," Yeah, it was and it was curated in a peculiar way. __EOS__ But, you know, actually you sort of retrospect but, you know, if you look back on it, it's really interesting. __EOS__ There was this guy in Minneapolis named Mel Jazz who had a matinee movie, it was the afternoon movie, and it was very different than now. Now you have all these choices but here as Joel says, he was the curator. If you wanted to watch a movies you watched Mel Jazz had programmed. And he would have, you know, Hercules movies, but he would also have, you know, ""8卿ｫ."" He bought probably the Joel Levine catalog, so he had all the Italian movies. So that was kind of our high low introduction to movies. __EOS__ That's funny. And did he talk during the movies? ",1,,16," Really it was a fantastic week. I was feeling really, really good. It could have come in another moment and it would have been very painful and I would have been suffering a lot. Because I really - I put a lot of heart in this CD. It's a very important project for me. __EOS__   __EOS__ The whole CD follows a certain projection. Not only in terms of the songs that you're singing, the titles that you've chosen, but in the way you sing them. __EOS__ Yes, absolutely. And the order was very important. It's about really the momentum of the characters in the love story in the beginning of the CD. As I say it's the construction of the crystal castle. Then in the middle of CD tragedy pops up and it talks about suffering and it talks about betrayal and it talks about all these terrible things that could happen in a love story. ",2,,17," And before long, he was a lookout. __EOS__ That's exactly right. My mother always says, she says, you know, kids need to think that you care before they care what you think. What Wes saw from the streets and from, you know, the kids on the corner and the kids who were dealing was he saw kids who he felt at that time genuinely cared about him and genuinely cared about his future. And he saw what they had and the material items that they had and how cool they looked, and then you see these kids who are willing to take you in and embrace you as family. __EOS__ Now, we should say that you also had run-ins with the law yourself, and you flirted with the idea of walking across that line and leading a life that could ultimately have led to prison. But when you were arrested for spraying graffiti on a wall, you immediately knew this is not someplace I want to be. And you were with someone who had a very different reaction. He almost dealt with the cops like, come on, bring it on. I'm tougher than you are. __EOS__ Thats exactly right, and you know, I think about it, and it is almost embarrassing now to think about the fact that I was, you know, here I was with, you know, with a tremendous mother and, you know, support from family but just this draw of the streets and this challenge that I was personally having internally about what does it mean to be a man, was really pulling at me. So it manifested itself in things like vandalism and getting into fights. ",0,,18," Ooh. Well, she's growing up in a household where she can certainly pick up the fundamentals. __EOS__ Absolutely. __EOS__ You know about Twitter and Facebook? __EOS__ I've only heard about Twitter, and I know about Facebook because my wife just got me a Facebook page, and at some point during this tour that I'm on,  she's going to show me how to do it myself. ",2,,19," Well, the psychology of fans, the sport itself - it's the same psychology that applies to any group membership. People are drawn to their groups, they insert themselves in the groups and those groups serve very fundamental, interpersonal and psychological needs. So even a team - you're not part of that group. You're not playing on that group. It's true. You're just a spectator of their performance. Still, their outcome is your outcome. You are psychologically a part of that group. And when it fails, you have failed.__EOS__ Chris says that he talked to one of his good friends who was watching the game at home and he said he even had physical reactions to the game. Let's play that clip.__EOS__ He just wasn't handling it well and transformed from someone who enjoyed the game a lot to someone who just was kind of incapacitated by how anxious he was feeling during the train wreck as everything kind of came off the rails. Watching, he was, like, physically uncomfortable to the point that he had to get up and leave his apartment. And, you know, he said even his wife recognized that there was a marked change in his demeanor. I don't know if she used the word terrifying or concerning or - but it was concerning enough that she noticed it and encouraged him to, you know, leave the TV behind.__EOS__ Now, I don't know this gentleman, but I do know that, in this area where I live, in the Washington, D.C. area, people say that they notice a marked change in the atmosphere in the local metropolitan area depending on whether the local football team, the Redskins, win or lose. Is that typical?",3,,20," Yeah, that's a good way of - I mean, look, if you're a tormented Christian who's frustrated with the God who will not answer, be happy that he doesn't answer you because this is what happens when the God you worship answers you sometimes. __EOS__ There was that Onion story years ago. __EOS__ Oh, yeah. __EOS__ Which you edited. Yeah, go ahead. ",1,,21,"  And I've been waking in the morning just like every other day, and just like every boring blues song, I get swallowed by the pain. And so I fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away...__EOS__ It is a skill, though, to be able to write songs that make people feel like they understand some kind of intimate part of you, yet be able to keep something for yourself.__EOS__ Yeah. Well, I mean, to me there are three parts to art - I mean, well, certainly to the art that I make. There's catharsis - which is, you know, dealing with the downsides of life. Then, of course, there's got to be empathy as well 'cause otherwise, it's just me reading out pages of my diary, which is embarrassing. You know, it's got to be presented in a way...__EOS__ Which could also be interesting.",2,,22," Bobby Timmons played piano. When we finished a tune and before I made an announcement on the mic, he'd play this little lick or something. __EOS__ Usually, if you don't like something, you walk away from it. If you listen to a recording, you take the tone arm off, you push the button. If you're in a club, you walk out. But if it's you you don't like, it's a little strange, you know. __EOS__ Frankly, we didn't expect any kindダﾝ __EOS__ In fact, I thought I wouldn't play again because my interest now was in the writing. And then I got the itch. I hadn't played in seven or eight years. It was like getting over a stroke, you know. Everything had gone - the armature was gone, cobwebs in the brain. It took me 10 years to get comfortable again. ",2,,23," Well, and I think a lot of times the depth with which Simon writes will leave people kind of feeling that it is kind of haunting and that he is kind of dark. I think to me, he's always been more of a novelist, almost, than a songwriter. He's just got a great knack for developing complex characters and showing you some sort of internal or external struggle. And Simon has kind of always been important to Omaha but he was one of the first guys in the late 80s and early 90s who really just kind of came into these open mike nights and painted with his own brush. And it was so powerful that I think he really, really influenced some of the younger songwriters who are now making a name for Omaha. __EOS__ One of those songwriters, perhaps the best known, is Conor Oberst. The 20-something fronts the indie rock band, Bright Eyes, and has been called a foxy young Bob Dylan by Rolling Stone. Although Oberst has packed up and moved to New York, his record label, Saddle Creek, is based solidly in Omaha. But there's another sound coming out of this city that doesn't involved any singers  jazz. One album, Fractured Intuition, was recently released by Omaha musicians Kevin Pike and John Kotchian. __EOS__ I think Kevin and John are unique in that they're kind of a part of this younger crowd, where you maybe would expect them to be out in a garage wearing a flannel shirt, screaming, but they chose to really discipline themselves and study jazz and have just done some amazing stuff with it. __EOS__ Is there much of a jazz scene there in Omaha? ",2,,24,"  You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle or sneeze or burp or fart. So no, no, no annoying sounds. Right? __EOS__ Does this count as annoying? __EOS__ The main character is called Gru, and the actor who provides his voice is TV and movie star Steve Carell. He's in our New York studios. Welcome to the program. __EOS__ Thank you very much. ",1,,25," That's whyダﾝ __EOS__ ダﾝbut we both are tongue-rollers and we both have attached earlobes, so that was - it was kind of my little scientific experiment. And then, it was interesting as we did find, as you've said, the similar manners is we both just stipulate a lot when we talk, we're both very animated and expressive, we're both - we both kind of mock-type while we speak, often as we're thinking things sometimes. __EOS__ Which is an odd thought, but it turned out, again, uncanny similarities. You both suffered from depression in college. You both took up very broadly similar careers; both interested in the same kinds of movies. Elyse, you were studying to be a film director. Paula Bernstein, you write about film. You've found out later you could have run into each other in the same movie theater in New York - the Angelika. __EOS__ It is true. ",0,,26," Yeah - well one, ""Pink Flamingos,"" which was basically about the filthiest people alive, and they were. __EOS__ And I read that you've dedicated the film ""Female Trouble"" to Tex Watson, who was really one of the, you know... __EOS__ Well, yeah, and that was really irresponsible, and I admit that. This chapter is as much of how I've changed, you know, through this. Charles Watson is basically who killed every one of the victims. He was Manson's best piece of work ever. But I'm not here to stick up for any of them but for Leslie. I'm not sure that all of them didn't have the same thing happen to them. They were controlled by a madman. __EOS__ Why do you think you were so fascinated with the Manson case and a lot of other cases where it seems you do have a real interest in crime? ",0,,27," Right now, we're driving south. We're going to what we call the south place. __EOS__ This is where Craig's great-great-grandparents - or my kid's great-great-grandparents homesteaded. And on the horizon is lots of houses that weren't here five years ago, and they just steadily creep north. __EOS__ They all look the same. There's nothing different about them. __EOS__ We like on a farm that, when I married my husband, was three miles north of Ankeny, which is a suburb that's just north of Des Moines. We are now surrounded on three sides of our farm with subdivisions. Our neighbors to the south sold for $23,000 an acre, and we have a neighbor to the east of us that sold for $45,800 an acre, I think. He got a dollar a square foot. We own, our family - not just Craig and I, but family members - own about 800 acres. And some people think I should cash in my chips and become a millionaire, but I don't know that many rich people that are happy. And my kids are pretty well grounded in agriculture, and they want to have a future here. And as long they want to do it, I will be here to make sure that the city honors the boundaries that - around this farm. This is a farm, and it's going to remain a farm. ",3,,28," Yes. That's all I did. The first thing before we started shooting, I said to Murray, I said, well, the first thing that comes to mind is, I'm not a very attractive man, nor have I ever been. And if I looked like this as a woman, I would have a lot of trouble.__EOS__ Did it make you rethink the kind of woman you were attracted to after thinking of yourself as an unattractive woman?__EOS__ Say again?__EOS__ OK. So many men, even if they think they're not attractive, really feel this desire that they have to, you know, be a partner with a beautiful woman.",1,,29," Yeah. But in the same time, they really want African expression, even they need more electrical sound, you know, a keyboard, electrical guitar, drums, but they really prefer the African expression, and it make me crazy. And live here, I think people are waiting for something more real, more traditional. And, yeah, I can do both, but it make me just crazy. __EOS__ Well, thank you for taking the time to talk to us. __EOS__ Thank you so much. __EOS__ Youssou N'Dour's new album is called ""Rokku Mi Rokka,"" or ""Give and Take."" ",2,,30," He said that I said I've written about it for Newsweek magazine several times. __EOS__ I'm going to need someone who speaks English. __EOS__ The first thing to know about Iran is that it's not evil. Iranians and Americans, they have much more in common than they have different. __EOS__ But what do I have in common with you? ",3,,31," It has helped me a lot in these 10 years to stay focused and trying to grasp for a higher ground because of the love that people have shown to him and to me. It gives me a sense of responsibility to those people. __EOS__ Since our conversation with Afeni Shakur, we've learned she's had to postpone her trip to South Africa and reportedly plans to spread her son's ashes in Soweto next year. __EOS__  When I was young, me and my mama  17 years old, kicked out on the street. Though back at the time I'd never see her face. Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place. Suspended from school, scared to go home. I was a fool with the big boys, breaking all the rule. Shed tears with my baby sister. Over these years we was  the little kids. And even though we had different daddies, the same drama. When things went wrong, we blamed mama. I reminisce on the stress I caused. It was hell hugging on my mama from a jail cell ダﾝ __EOS__ Coming up, a new study says Americans pay a higher price for dropping out of school than people in other countries, and there's no place like home. That's because where you live can affect how long you live. We'll discuss these and other topics on our Roundtable next.

But he had very bad eyesight. __EOS__ So I think most people know that, you know, he took his life after... __EOS__ Killed himself, yeah. __EOS__ Yeah - and this was not long - it was, like, a few months after your late-night show, which he was producing, on Fox was canceled. And apparently, the network asked him to leave. You opposed that, and then the whole show got canceled. ",1,,36," 'Cause you wanted to know, you know, what jazz artists were playing in the city when your team was out of town. When you played the Knicks, for example, you went to Birdland. But I'm interested in the music. Did the music -did you turn to the music in times of trouble? __EOS__ Not really. I just - I was a jazz lover. Don't ask me how I come by being a jazz lover and finished high school in 1946. Everybody else was listening to singing groups, you know. And I just, I mean, you know, Dexter Gordon and Miles Davis and Yusef Lateef and Jimmy Smith, you know. I just took a liking, you know. And in a sense it was an escape. I mean, you got to do something. You know, I tried to going to the late movies.

Damien, we're go for explosion. __EOS__ I love the idea that you, the special effects man, lost a finger in ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" which isダﾝ __EOS__ ダﾝwhich was a special-effects-heavy film, of course. __EOS__ Oh, that's such a slow-moving film about, you know, a driver and a woman that he drives. ",3,,38," No. You see...__EOS__ And were tormented and wrestling with their true nature that they couldn't express?__EOS__ No. You never got to that point, but that's because these ended when they did as a popular pop culture form. If these had lasted and thrived into the 1980s, let's say, or certainly the '90s, you would have started to see those stories. But at this point, even the religion question was usually cloaked in these. So there was an issue called ""Different"" in one of the Simon and Kirby books, and they never really say what the different thing is about the guy, but clearly it's that he's Jewish. I mean anybody like me, who's Jewish, could read the story and say, oh, I mean yeah, that's what this is. But they don't come right out and say it because it was 1952.__EOS__ So how did you figure out that this guy was Jewish and that that was his secret?",0,,39," The White Mandingos came together at Jenifer's house in Woodstock, where he and Jenkins would hang out and jam.

But really, you know, ideologies are tough to obviously parse out. You know, often you'll find people - their ideology coincides with whatever helps them financially, right? Or their business tends to work in line of their ideology. So I'm not saying, oh, Hamed Wardak believes this just because he's profiting from it. But what I am saying is the evidence is there that this group, which represents itself as sort of a group of, you know, concerned Afghan-Americans and so on, was set up by one particular high-paid lobbying firm in Washington - Patton Boggs is a law firm in Washington - basically for Hamed Wardak. __EOS__ So what are the implications of that?

Looking back, was your theology working or were you in denial or shock? __EOS__ It was working. Every minister spends a lifetime preparing for this exam. The most important work we do is done with families in bereavement. But we really don't know, having given all of this advice and held all of these hands and walked all of these journeys through the valley, how we ourselves are going to respond.

Describe what the play was and describe how the movie turned out.__EOS__ The play was about a group of tourists who were caught in an Italian hotel, I think, a hotel on the border of Italy, when the Italians had started bombing, I believe it was Paris. I can't remember. But anyway, they were caught there. And the story is about, you know, the interaction between these tourists.

He certainly wanted to provide them all the aid that he could so that they could survive.

In other words, that Germany planned to come over and establish German states in Latin and South America. And he said this map was a German map and proved it. Well, it caused all sorts of great furor in the country. And it turned out actually, that that map was a forgery, that the British had forged it and had slipped it to FDR.

I still had a lot of control. I had started on my record before I sign with a major label. I didn't know how I was going to pay for it. These were friends of mine. We were hanging out. We didn't have a plan. Everything was just, let's just hang and write something together and let don't stress about it because I was really weary of recording again. I didn't want to go back in the studio and go back into the hot seat of pressure of being an artist again. I just really wanted to just teach and be quiet, you know, and not perform.

I mean, should the United States actively back other movements in other Middle Eastern countries? __EOS__ I'm not arguing that the United States should have a policy of overthrowing everybody's government. We had nothing to do with the uprising in Tunisia or Egypt or in Libya. These are spontaneous moves on the part of the people of those countries. __EOS__ When they make that move, how do we react?

Very quickly he became conflicted by his role there and he became a man really torn between loyalties. Yes, he was a British officer in the field. But because he was in military intelligence in Cairo, he knew of the betrayal that was coming; the way the British and the French have divided up the Middle East between themselves, detail that the Arabs knew nothing about. And the longer he spent in the field, and he's recruiting men to go on missions with him and he's fighting alongside them and they're dying alongside him, the more I think he felt just a crushing sense of guilt about his role in the war.

Did you ever consider a military career? __EOS__ Well, to be honest, being quite an admirer of my own father and my - and our interesting family history over the years, I had my sight set on the Naval Academy pretty much from the time I was about 10 years old. But when push came to shove, when I actually got to it, there was just a little voice that told me, you know, maybe it's time to try something different. Maybe there are ways you can express your patriotism and not necessary follow in this tradition. After all, I felt like we'd maxed the course on that area. And I looked at the difficulty my dad had, sort of, trying to live up to the shadow of his father and I thought, you know what? Let's try and be the best in another category. __EOS__ I understand we should congratulate you, that you're going to celebrate your first Father's Day this year. __EOS__ Yeah, it's pretty exciting. I'm a little sleep deprived, so I'm glad this radio and not television.

It was kind of fun. We alternated. If it was Chick's tune, he was the boss. If I was - if it's my tune, I was the boss. But it wasn't a - it was just because somebody had to make a decision. And it went quicker that way, . But everybody contributed a lot to each other's tunes. So it was just a great experience. __EOS__ Let's get some listeners in on the conversation  800-989-8255, 800-989-talk. Email  talk@npr.org.

I love that movie.__EOS__ But this - it sounds like you guys were just having a blast.__EOS__ It was more fun than you think.__EOS__ .,0,,88," And I'm like, I don't like J.K. Rowling anymore. Actually, I am a purist and I do not like to mix my Harry Potter and my ""Twilight."" I have a pile next to my bed and it's the seven Harry Potter books and I have the three ""Twilight"" books. I don't want to get those worlds mixed, because once I do I know it's just going to go crazy.__EOS__ If Jojo is worried about mixing up her imaginary worlds now, just wait till she reads Meyer's new book, ""The Host."" Geared to the adult market, it's a science fiction romance where two women, one an alien from outer space, inhabit the same body and are in love with the same man. Meyer says writing dialogue for characters that share the same body wasn't a problem for her.__EOS__ All of these characters in my other books, in this book, all of them take place in one head - mine. So I'm really used to internal conversations. That came pretty easily. I hear voices all the time.__EOS__ And just as Meyer writes about good vampires in the ""Twilight"" books, she's created kinder, gentler alien invaders in ""The Host.""",0,,89," Mr. Zuckerman had the best swing in the county. It was a single long piece of heavy rope tied to the beam over the north doorway. The bottom end of the rope was a fat knot to sit on. It was arranged so that you could...__EOS__ It was arranged so that you could swing without being pushed. You climbed a ladder to the hayloft, then holding the rope you stood at the edge and looked down. And you were scared and dizzy. Then you straddled the knot so that it acted as a seat. And you got up all your nerve, took a deep breath and jumped.__EOS__ E.B. White started reading that passage. I think I never heard his voice before. And we also heard a 10-year-old from Washington, D.C. reading there.__EOS__ One of the pigs he was raising died. And while he was carrying the pails of slops every day to the replacement pig in the barn, he noticed that there was a spider attending its web every day, expanding the web, rebuilding what had happened the night before. And then one day he saw that it had spun an egg case. And so he stopped to examine it.",0,,90," Well,  but not if you are living in Philadelphia and that's where it's polluted. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ You are still living in a place that's polluted no matter how many offsets are in Brazil. __EOS__ Well, yes, exactly. I think, yes, I mean we all  you kind of think abstractly, Terry, you got to think abstractly. ",3,,91," Let's talk about a musical family that was a huge family - would have to have a very big table to sit around - and that was the Bach's.  __EOS__ They would be the biggest, Renee. There were at least 50 Bachs who were musicians. For example, Bach's grandfather and Bach's father Johann Ambrosius. Bach himself had 20 children with two wives. The sons of Bach who were well-known musicians were Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Gottfried Heinrich Bach, Johann Christoph Bach, and Johann Christian Bach. And that's only some of them. And then we have cousins and uncles, and it just goes on and on. __EOS__ By the way, Renee, this is a little portion of a symphonia or symphony by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, the famous Bach's youngest son. He wrote some very nice pieces, but there's nothing of Wilhelm Friedemann that reaches the great heights of his daddy. __EOS__ You know, we just mentioned a moment ago Mozart's sister. How about other female - well, musicians. Or in this case how about other... ",2,,92," Because the Greenpeace ships observe. They don't try and interfere, right?__EOS__ They observe, they don't ダ_ yeah. And, you know, Watson attempted to attack them. It was, you know, sort of heart-stopping.__EOS__ Right. Well, so he's got this ramming bar, I mean, this blade attached to the bow of his vessel and he's going to try and rip a hole in the hull of the Japanese ship, right? What happened?__EOS__ Well, so he had one shot at it because as soon as they would see, you know, who it was they would take off. So here he is. You know, he's coming up on them, pedal to the metal. It's sort of like, you know, give it more, Scotty. You know. Oh, Captain, she's, like, coming apart. It was like that.",0,,93,"  Right.  But what I argue in my piece and what I believe firmly as a Muslim and as a writer is that we can't allow the lowest common denominator in society to define our conversations as civilizations, and literature is a critical element in moving civilizations forward.  We've got to accept that and we also need to allow for the kind of conversations that would actually move the Muslim world and the West together forward. __EOS__  And yet, you say that might happen.  Hundreds of people were killed in rioting over those Danish cartoons. __EOS__  I know, and I'm not naive about any of the risks that are playing out because of ideologies out there that support violence.  But at the same time, I know that we can be pretty smart and we can to try figure out how to take on challenges like that. __EOS__  Let's see if we can get some callers in on the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org.  And we'll begin with Abu and Abu and is with us from Charlottesville in Virginia. ",0,,94,"  There's a loving in your eyes all the way.__EOS__ In 1982, the Irish-Catholic singer joined a Jewish drummer, a Protestant guitar and keyboard player and a Jamaican bassist to form the Culture Club. The band was groundbreaking, not just for its multicultural makeup, but also for its music. Culture Club combined calypso, country, reggae and pop, and they hit it big. This song, ""Karma Chameleon,"" was number one in 16 countries.__EOS__  Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon.__EOS__ Now, after Culture Club, Boy George kept recording when he could, but it's been a while. His first solo album in 19 years comes out tomorrow. When he joined us from London to talk about it, I asked him to listen back to an interview he did with Johnny Carson on ""The Tonight Show"" in 1984. Boy George had grown tired of all the DJs asking the same questions about his childhood and his look. Here's Johnny.",2,,95," Well, because I am a little more noticeable and a little more above board because, in Washington, D.C. we have what, Secret Service, FBI, local law enforcement. My fights have to be a little more recognizable. Phoenix, who has a lot different drug situations, gang situations, he's a little more in the shadows, but we're still fighting the same war. It's just different battlegrounds. __EOS__ And, but can I  forgive me, I just feel like I have to ask, there are people who just think you're crazy. That you're just going to subject yourself... __EOS__ And that's fine. No, and that's fine. __EOS__ You're going to subject yourself to being hurt. ",3,,96," Yup. __EOS__ where there was just this togetherness. __EOS__ You have so many great songs on this album, but what song do you think that you changed the most when - for this album? You know, because you have instrumental versions of songs with lyrics, lyrical versions of songs that were instrumentals. You know, how did you come up with the flow that allowed you to change things up? __EOS__ That's a very interesting question. I don't know. I think we did it in a good way, the changes that we made in the songs so that the songs are recognizable but they've got a different something happening on them that makes people go, oh, that is Breezin'. But I didn't know somebody was singing, is that Al? ",2,,97," Tonight is the premiere of the new FX comedy series he's producing called ""Totally Biased,"" featuring comic W. Kamau Bell.__EOS__  Everything OK?__EOS__  Yeah, everything's OK, but I had a fight with that neighbor again. In the elevator, she attacked me. I had to - made up some story to get out of it. I mean, it was like horrible.__EOS__  What was she mad about?",1,,98," Now, there's also another one that has to deal with Althea Gibson. You've got Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Carol Moseley-Braun. __EOS__ Oh, yes. Uh-huh. And that's the U.S. Open coming up on September 27th out at the new Billie Jean King Tennis Center. And it is a tribute to Althea Gibson, yes, and African-American women of first - some that you just named, Jackie Joyner and Carol Moseley, Susan Depeth. And I believe someone said I was in that group. I hope so. __EOS__ Absolutely. __EOS__ But that's what it's about. ",2,,99," The Spelunking Club. And I said, I don't know what that word means. And I got my mother to take me over to the meeting, and suddenly, here was this thing about exploration. There was an image of a person on rope rappelling into a black abyss. It was such a perfect shot, because the pure utter blackness of what he was rappelling into, the starkness of him against that, the sun shining down on this moss-lit shaft. It was just like Jules Verne right there before my eyes, and that was it, that was the scene. It got me hooked right away.__EOS__ And everything changed at that moment. Cave exploring actually became his profession, a life right at the edge of human possibility. What you do is climb Everest in reverse. I mean, these caves are as deep as Everest is high.__EOS__ That's true but with one critical difference. On Everest, they're shedding weight as they're coming down and they're coming down light. We don't have that option. When we're at the bottom of a cave, you actually have to pull your way back out. So the hard part starts at the bottom.__EOS__ Here's Bill's TED Talk.",3,,100," OK. And it was available to anybody for free. And how many people followed the course or participated?__EOS__ Well over 100,000.__EOS__ OK.__EOS__ I think getting up to 200,000, perhaps.",3,,101," No. I don't believe in marriage. I just believe that if people love themselves, why do they have to get married? I never believed in that institution. I don't believe in many things. I believe if two people love themselves, they should stay together and be happy. So I try to be open with my relationship and I take my family, who I call my kids, I put them before anything, before myself. I think they are the future. __EOS__ Also very clear. __EOS__ We all accepted his 27 wives. Everybody accepted his 27 wives, except my mother, of course. __EOS__ Well, well... ",2,,102," Yes. __EOS__ So I am the one, Elyse, who experienced all these separations. And in fact, I'm the one who, you know, felt that it did answer a key element of my identity meeting Paula - or not meeting Paula, but just simply learning that I had a twin. I was more relaxed knowing the truth about that I have had a twin. __EOS__ So - whereas I felt that I was less relaxed, knowing that it made my life, you know, that it brought more of a sense of anxiety about identity that in that, it - you know, it was, I mean, I think it was unnerving to both of us, but in some ways, it clicked for Elyse more. __EOS__ Well, it was unnerving when she became a reality. That was complicated. But when it was - when I got the letter and I found out I had a twin, I was elated simply knowing the truth. ",0,,103," Yes, absolutely. And I think the senator showed something of his true spirit, of his faith, and how that faith plays itself out in his daily life. __EOS__ You must have watched the interview last with the ABC News and Governor Palin. __EOS__ Yes, I did. __EOS__ Did it strike you, as you were watching, as someone like us, if you will, kind of a more or less average person, talking with this network news anchor, and that the more or less average person really didn't know what the Bush doctrine is? ",3,,104," Did you know how to perform onstage in a place like the Opry? __EOS__ Not really. I just got out there with my guitar, and I sang. I mean, I just did it just like I was doing it at home, you know. I never thought about it being the Grand Ole Opry because if I had, I wouldn't have been able to have done it. You just pretty well got to figure, well, you know, this is something I could do every day. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ It's so much like what you do every day. ",2,,105," And it's not all his fault. He's so kind of careless about the relationship, he doesn't even remember he apologized to you five years ago.__EOS__ Yeah. And that's very Louis. I think he was being, you know, pretty honest in that exchange. And I think there was a lot of genuine emotion there. I think that on some, some part of him was, that was a genuine apology for what might have been his side of the selfishness in our relationship. I'm going to look at it that way, because I feel that - because he was definitely - just listening, and as you know, when you just listen and you don't have any visuals, there's an emotional depth to it that I don't think I really heard until I just listened to that now when you played it.__EOS__ So when I heard it, I was thinking, OK, so Louis C.K. is the new main character in this, and he's giving the blame to himself, because it's going to make it a more interesting episode, and because he's a generous guy. And so he's going to blame himself in his show and not blame you. But you think he's actually taking some of the blame for real in this.__EOS__ Well, I think that these things are two-sided, and I think that when you listen to my podcast, that I could've pointed fingers. I could've been petty, and in that moment where, you know, I take responsibility for my side of it, I could've said but you, but you this, but you that, but you - and, you know, I realized like this was - that's not the time for it. You know, understand and take the consequences of your actions. So I think there's a chance - you would have to ask Louis - if there was some part of him that was, you know, taking some responsibility, or maybe he was just, you know, created this role and did his riff on our riff, and made it his own in that way. I don't really know. You'd have to ask him. But I do know that we are getting along better.",3,,106," Because, you know, there are a lot of times you are having the specialties of a country. And sometime I was having Bulgarian foods. What's the typical side for this that's really, you know, something that you recommend as a nice typical side of yours? French fries with cheese on top. And I'm like, all right. You know, you got to get it. You got to go for it. But I was really hoping he'd say salad that day. It didn't work out that way. __EOS__ There are other challenges in finding a different country's cuisine to dine on every day. Even in Southern California, it's tough locating a place that serves there from Uzbekistan or Mozambique. __EOS__ Amazingly, Scotland and Wales are really difficult. New Zealand is kind of difficult, although now, I have some options for that. __EOS__ Noah has received some help. Readers of his blog have chimed in with their recommendations. A few have even invited him over to cook him food from their homelands. But back to Afghanistan and our lunch. ",3,,107," Carl, we hope you can forget those labor pains. __EOS__ Thanks so much for the encouragement. __EOS__ Sure. __EOS__ Let's go to Joseph, Joseph with us from Lawrence, Kentucky.

Natalie and Marsha released three albums in the course of four years, and Floetry earned seven Grammy nominations. But then came the pressure to conform.__EOS__ Management and the label kind of leaning. I mean, a direct quote, as I was quite often being asked to ""dumb my lyrics down,"" and to rap more so than being a poet. And I wasn't very comfortable with the route that we were being suggested to go into.__EOS__ But her friend and collaborator, Marsha, did take that route. She went to the U.S. to launch her solo career.__EOS__ She didn't want to make a neo-soul music anymore. She didn't feel like it was really who she is. She wanted to do something else. And there is room for everybody.",2,,110," Thanks. __EOS__ The safety concerns with the crew I was with are always - were always present. Every one of them had a terrible story of either someone getting killed or someone, you know, seriously, you know, crushed and made it out alive. But, I mean, serious injury not just, you know, a little broken finger. So it was always a concern and there were every day, practically, a new, you know, something new that was - they were coming up with to make it a better environment. __EOS__ And a constant, you report, a constant topic of conversation is what the miners refer to as the top. This is good top. This is bad top. __EOS__ That's always the first thing that seemed that they would look at because, you know, the top is basically the roof over your head, which is barely - it's really more over your shoulder because it's only five feet tall there. And, you know, in some places, it's good and some places it's bad. It depends on the rock formation above it. It depends on whether you're, you know, in limestone or shale or what other geological forces around you. But it's, you know, it's crumbling. It's certainly crumbling a lot and caving in. I mean, there were cave-ins when I was there. It's common. ",3,,111," Thank you, Rachel. I appreciate it.__EOS__ So I understand this has been a personal interest of yours for a long time - the connection that twins share.__EOS__ I grew up with twins being a sort of shadow over my childhood. My younger sister Vicki, who is two years and 10 months younger, was a twin. And I expected my mother to come home from the hospital with two babies and there was only one. And I couldn't understand why everybody else got healthy babies and somehow the baby that would have been my brother didn't make it. So, you know, as will happens with three-year-olds, I thought it had to do with the fact that he was a boy and I decided he was a kind of stand in for me. So I actually went through a little part of my childhood with the fantasy that I was an identical twin and that the other one was gone somewhere.__EOS__ Can you lay out - understanding you don't want to give too much away - but what is the central gist of the narrative?",0,,112,"  I ain't easy to love. Scars have made me black and blue, but I feel a lot less broken every day I spend with you...__EOS__ The album is called ""Life Happens"" and Candi Staton joins me now.

I think with you, you've many, many acts overt he acts over the course of your life.",2,,113," I thought they did a great job with what they had to work with. He cut it down to just the bare bones of what it was supposed to be. And I think it plays out real well in the film.__EOS__ Was there anything in there that was embellished or just not true but made for a better movie; they needed to change something for the narrative?__EOS__ I think - I noticed one of the liberties that Hollywood took in the movie that I just kind of - I remember sitting back in my chair and was like, why would you put that in there? - is when at the very end of the movie, they have the Taliban working me over pretty good...__EOS__ Uh-huh.",0,,114," Dear editor  I love our community pool. My birthday party has been there every single summer since forever, but my forever is now over. You know what? Maybe I'm the fool and blind, or should I say I was a fool who used to be blind. I was dumb enough to fall for the ugly lies. I was blind to hatred that stings more like a bucket full of the pool's strongest chlorine. Gloriana June Hemphill, age 11.__EOS__ That was actually Cofield Collins, a student in Mississippi reading from the book ""Glory Be."" We turn to the Emily J. Pointer Library in Como, Mississippi, to get questions from young readers there. Here's Cofield again.__EOS__ My name is Cofield Collins. I'm 11, and I'm in the sixth grade. How is Glory so brave even if grownups around her are not?__EOS__ That is a great question. And I think I made Glory very brave because so many of the kids that I knew when I was in sixth grade, really, would not have been like Glory. So I wanted her to be the exceptional child in that time period. I wanted her to do something that not many kids would do. And I think between her father and the librarian, Miss Bloom, encouraging her, Glory really sort of learned a lot and began to stand up, and I think that's why she turned out to be a whole lot braver than I or any of my friends ever were.",0,,115," Well, of all the holidays mentioned in the Bible, it says happiness, that we must be happy by the holiday Sukkot the most. So of all the holidays in our tradition, this is considered to be the happiest of all holidays. __EOS__ We'll see how that goes over. __EOS__ That would be very appropriate. And certainly if anybody's walking by my house, I would encourage you to do that. __EOS__ And finally, what's the proper greeting for Sukkot? ",3,,116," It was Rex Ryan who first interested Dawidoff, a casual football fan. Ryan was brash, funny, loud and huge. Dawidoff would soon come to see him as the most inspirational person he'd ever met. But it wasn't necessarily football that Dawidoff, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, was drawn to. He writes stories about outsiders who joined established institutions and come to affect the culture. Country stars, the topic of one of Dawidoff's books, fall into that category. So do CIA agents, who Dawidoff compares to football people in that they're resigned to living in a world thought to be understood by outsiders but which is actually obscured.__EOS__ They're NFL coaches for a reason. They are seriously motivating, nurturing, intelligent, kindhearted, dedicated people. I mean...__EOS__ One day, Rex Ryan approach Dawidoff and asked him a question. Ryan knew that Dawidoff's father was a distant troubled figure who battled mental illness. You're expecting a child. Does being a dad worry you, given your own history, the coach wanted to know. What's that like? Dawidoff was touched.__EOS__ You know, a lot of people in my life who know all about my childhood, they've never asked me anything about this. And it was just completely natural for Rex to ask about it. And that might seem like a very personal line of  for somebody who doesn't know you that well, but Rex is completely used to talking to people on the most intimate terms. People reciprocate at that level of comfort, and they become closer to him and they'll do more for him.",0,,117," Yeah, right. We are talking about what it takes to write a new kind of mystery writer - mystery book. We are talking with mystery writer Tana French. And if you would like to give us a call, the number is 800-989-8255. And joining us now is Louis Bayard, who went from writing romantic comedies to taking on the mystery genre. He is the author of three mystery novels, including the Edgar Award-nominated ""Pale Blue Eye."" His newest book, ""The Black Tower,"" will be release this August. And he is with me in Studio 3A. Good to have you with us. __EOS__ Thanks, it's great to be here. __EOS__ And what's really interesting, Louis, about your books is that you, in fact, reach into the past and kind of re-imagine the past, and in that way, create a new kind of mystery novel. __EOS__ For instance, in ""Mr. Timothy,"" you kind of re-imagine what might have to happen to Tiny Tim had he lived on. In ""The Pale Blue Eye,"" you bring in the famous Edgar Allan Poe into play.

It's tempting to think it is. I mean, it feels like he is a regular overweight kind of sad, 12-year-old, who is basically trying to get along in the world anyway he can. __EOS__ You know, if you want to teach a college class implying that this is all in his head, then you go right ahead. But, you can get it from the author right here that this is not in his head. He is real. ",0,,119," We actually started off filming in more than just those three countries. And over time, while we watched the various revolutions change and we witnessed the ways the sort of legacy media outlets were covering the stories, we all decided to pick stories that weren't being told actually as much other ones. So Bahrain obviously has been nicknamed - and I'm sure there are comments about this - The Forgotten Revolution.__EOS__ Maryam, you know, it's very difficult for me in my comfortable home here in the United States to imagine being put in the kind of position to make the decisions that you've made. You and your family, through multiple arrests, through beatings - I mean, your father was tortured - and I wonder when you're weighing personal safety, not just personal safety but your entire family's safety, how you decide that that calculation is still worth it, I mean, especially seeing what's happened in Syria? How do you still keep moving forward?__EOS__ Well, I mean, I think to some extent, it's because we grew up with that kind of mindset. I mean, my father has been through so much. I remember from 2001 until 2011, I saw my father coming home numerous times with marks of beatings on his back. And I always posed the same question to him is why do you continue doing what you're doing when the outcome is not what you want it to be? And he always told me someday you'll understand.__EOS__ I just wanted to actually play another clip from the film in which you're talking about this very issue in terms of reporting human rights abuses in Bahrain.",1,,120," I think the answer is actually a bit of both. It is unique in the sense that it has attained a kind of quality well beyond Guantanamo. It is almost - it's mythic in proportion.

Like, Iranian people are like us.__EOS__ Well, I think that - you know, oddly enough, I think that is what was infuriating to them about the piece, I think, was not the spying issue, but that Maziar stated in it that Americans and Iranians have things in common. And I think the idea that America - that you could somehow find common cause with the great Satan - was the most problematic part of the piece, that the idea that Iranians and Americans are, you know, similar on the scale of humanity.__EOS__ That's interesting. It's like, oh, we have so much in common with Satan .__EOS__ That's exactly right. So imagine you've got this country that spends an awful lot of time burning our flags.

Yeah, see, what most people don't know and they're going to find out now, we sang as much four-part harmony on those street corners as we did doo-wop because Nicky was really good at pulling four-part out of the air, as I said before. And we could do Hi-Lows, we can do Four Freshman.__EOS__ That's what it sounds like...__EOS__ We did.__EOS__ Yeah, that's what it sounds like.",2,,125," I would have to say that they're different. You know... __EOS__ Different reflections of, I guess a similar quality, wouldn't you think? __EOS__ Right. Yeah, absolutely. What strikes me there is that, of course, pride in one's child is beautiful. But you can have pride in a marriage, too, that doesn't have to be destructive. __EOS__ Sandra, oh, go ahead, I'm sorry.

Mishka...__EOS__ ....I love you.__EOS__ I love you.__EOS__ I love you.",3,,127," Yeah, exactly.__EOS__ And you have the built-in narrative drive of the season. Practice, game one, game two and so on and so forth and interweaving the stories within those - within that structures of the sports season.__EOS__ Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, that was, you know, that was another reason that we decided to kind of focus on the team, because it did give us an inherent beginning, middle and an end. But, you know, for us, it was never about the football. And hopefully, when audiences see it, they realize that it's, you know, football is the lens that we're - that we enter the story on, but it's definitely not what the film is about.__EOS__ Yeah, the themes are much more universal. I mean, we're really exploring ideas of, you know, themes of fatherhood, you know, themes of, you know, a lot of subtext is resilience. You know, the, you know, and really exploring the world of the haves and have-nots through the conduit of football.",1,,128," Marco and Celia first meet when she auditions for the circus, and he realizes that she may be more than just a master of illusion. __EOS__  No one is watching her except Marco as she stands perfectly still on the stage, waiting patiently. And then very slowly, her gown begins to change. Starting at the neckline, seeping down like ink, the green silk is turning a murky midnight black. Marco gasps. Chandresh and Madame Padva turned at the sound just in time to witness the creeping black fade into snow-bright white at the bottom of the skirt until all evidence that the gown was ever green is gone. __EOS__ As mind boggling as Marco and Celia's tricks may be, Morgenstern says their magic goes only so far in helping them to shape their own destiny. __EOS__ The phrase nothing is impossible comes up a lot. I think I wanted to play with that a little bit and have that there were limits to what could be done, like, that there's a life and death sort of aspect, that they can't fix certain things.

""The Big Lebowski"" might be the all-time favorite, though.__EOS__ That's great.__EOS__ And ""Schindler's List.""__EOS__ Well, we are Jews.",1,,130," My father said, you are not marrying my daughter until after she has that baby. You are never gonna be able to say that you had to marry her, because you don't. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ We will take care of her. __EOS__ I was not exactly the most stand up person at that time, but I said, look, I want marry her and that's it. ",3,,131," It may turn out, judged from what we're learning from the British and the Australians, that separating kids temporarily, not totally sex-segregated education, but to have special classes for girls and boys. It may be the way to go, and in fact far from being something from the past it may be cutting-edge, and we're seeing lots of good effects with special reading and writing classes for boys, and math and science classes for girls.__EOS__ Just briefly, before we take our break, and I believe you're going to stay with us and we're happy about that, but your book, ""The War Against Boys,"" came out 12 years ago. It was subtitled, ""How Misguided Feminism is Harming Our Young Men."" I know you've changed the subtitle for an upcoming edition, but I have to ask has your attitude changed? I mean, is it your view that feminism is the problem. Or is it - what is - is it that feminism is the problem here?__EOS__ Yeah, I never meant to indict the feminist movement. I meant misguided, sort of hard-lined male intolerant feminism, but I don't think most feminists are that way. And I think that that subtitle led many people to just close their mind to the message of my book. And so I certainly didn't want to do that. So I've changed it to, ""How Misguided Policies,"" and I think there are many policies that are harming young men and it's not the fault of feminists.__EOS__ You have two boys yourself?",3,,132," I've seen it 710, I think. __EOS__ Okay. __EOS__ No, I've only seen it only once, I think. __EOS__ It's too embarrassing. I don't want to watch it again. It's also ruined my life. ",1,,133," Yeah.__EOS__ Well, I interviewed him a few years ago. You want to hear what he had to say about ""Annie""?__EOS__ Yes. Please.

It's a sunny day. I'm on my own, whistle, wave, buy a cocktail with an umbrella. The sky is near enough to touch, clouds of perfumed water. The dreamy air kisses me because it's a perfect day. ",2,,135," Fred Hersch is happy to be back at the Vanguard, where his photograph has earned a permanent place on one of the green, felt-covered walls. __EOS__ It's above Coltrane, and next to Bill Evans and catty-corner from Mingus, and not that I, in my wildest dreams, think that I'm at that level as an artist. __EOS__ Some might say he's pretty close. __EOS__ He has a loving, beautiful way of creating nuance from the piano. ",2,,136," Well, I'm starting to see notes fly out. __EOS__ There you go. And I'm guessing from that recording that that timpani player is using pretty hardheaded sticks with hard felt and not the soft, mushy, spongy sticks. __EOS__ Now, why did that cause such an uproar? __EOS__ Well, I don't think anybody had ever heard such a thing in the opera house before, just with naked snare rolls. I think it was quite revolutionary. ",2,,137," In 1918, he runs into Anne Vanderbilt, and she becomes very interested in yoga. And such wonderful things happened to the Vanderbilt family through their relationship with Bernard that she ended up bankrolling part of his move to Nyack, New York, where he began to buy land and set up what is basically the first established American ashram. __EOS__ Your description of the Clarkstown Country Club certainly does not sound like an ashram. It sounds more like something that resembled a circus, with elephants and baseball games played in drag, and so on. Describe what it was like. __EOS__ Well, the cream of the crop of American society was interested in Bernard's teachings. There were heiresses from wealthy families, a great war spy named Sir Paul Dukes. There were attorneys, and Bernard put on professional grade circuses and vaudeville entertainments that lasted from tea in the afternoon until dawn. And he did all of this out of a belief that this was part of becoming a well-rounded person. __EOS__ Given that yoga is now a multibillion dollar industry - some call it the yoga industrial complex - do you think Pierre Bernard would be proud of what it has become? ",3,,138," All of it. And it's just something about the way we, as performers from this city, the way we do things. We hear extra sounds in our heads, extra beats, extra backbeats, extra rhythms that people from other parts of the United States just don't understand or get. __EOS__  Another man done gone. Another man done gone. Another man done gone. He had to leave his home. Another man done gone. __EOS__ The phrasing, it just sounds so much like New Orleans in particular. And as a female vocalist, Irma is the epitome of that. __EOS__  Another storm has come... ",2,,139," Glad to be here. __EOS__ So paint a picture of the first Thanksgiving for us. It wasn't a table with fancy fixings and a turkey and some golden turret was it? __EOS__ It was pretty rustic. It was more like I think an outside barbeque than a sit down dinner. __EOS__ Okay. So I guess in my head I picture the English sitting on one side of the table and the Native Americans sitting on the other side of the table and everyone breaking bread together, but not so much. ",3,,140," Yeah, it was a time in my life where I was depressed and didn't know what depression was. And I was disengaged with tennis. I woke up in a life that I realized it wasn't mine, I wasn't connected to. I hated what I did. I was in a marriage I didn't want to be in. And I was depressed and somebody came along and offered me an escape and, and I took it. And for a moment there was vast sadness. __EOS__ Were there consequences for you your assistant who you kind of ratted out in your letter, you've said that he used meth and, that, you know, he spiked his drink that you accidentally drank? __EOS__ He had already kind of fallen off the radar. He was gone. But I watched that drug rip his life apart. He was in a rehab and was, had already publicly sort of confessed to his circle that he was, you know, dying with this addiction. And so, there was nothing private about that part of it. But, you know, in the book I sort of refer him as Slim, which was also deliberate. __EOS__ To hide his real name. ",0,,141," OK.__EOS__ I think a lot of your fans would be surprised to find out that your mother was mentally ill. You found this out later. You weren't even being raised by her. At a certain point, you were being raised by an aunt who you thought was your mother. And then your mother shows up one day, for reasons that you're still not clear on, and then took you to live at a group home.__EOS__ It wasn't a group home; it was a convent.__EOS__ Convent.",0,,142," Well, derogatory way. I mean, they're actually called - forgive me - Rhineland bastards by the Gestapo, made to wear black stars. That doesn't all happen in your novel, but still, this really beguiling young trumpeter, Hieronymus, he speaks German.__EOS__ Yes. He's a German citizen, born and raised in that area and so - yeah. He is very much a German and this is how he would, you know, identify himself if questioned. But, of course, you know, in this kind of horribly fraught regime, he's other.__EOS__ He's other. And they have to escape and they don't all make it out. We won't say who does and who doesn't. But did you write some of this novel in Germany?__EOS__ I did, but only, you know, in the very final drafts. The novel was conceived because I was living in Germany. I was in southern Germany for over a year starting in 2006. I had an artist fellowship there and so just being a black woman in Germany, I started to think about the history of African people or people of African descent in Germany and, you know, started doing some research and found some - you know, not many, but - you know, a few terrific sources that gave whole histories.",0,,143," Dispatches from China's Most Popular Literary Star .""__EOS__ Not so long ago, many Chinese commentators wrote in a cautious, oblique style designed not to offend the nation's famously humorless leaders. Then came the Internet, blogs and a cheeky young man named Han Han. The voice of China's post-'80s generation, Han was ironic, skeptical and blunt. He wrote what many young Chinese thought, but dared not say publicly.__EOS__ I participated in quite a few essay competitions. Before each event, I had to brainwash myself and check to see what slogans were in fashion.__EOS__ Han on the rule of law.",0,,144," So I was going to - I wanted to acknowledge that. And I wanted to acknowledge and glory in all of the different creators, all of the different aspects of Batman, including the original Batman movie, including the most recent versions, including Neal Adams, a wonderful Batman artist, and you know, the third Neal to be mentioned on this show who also didn't spell his name correctly. He spelled it like Neal Conan. __EOS__ Neal Adams who re-imaged, who gave us the longer, pointer ears, the more swirlingy cloak, he put Batman back at night back in the '70s and essentially made him cool again after the Adam West version of Batman had had un-cooled him ultimately. So I got to try and say - talk about how much I loved all of those things and of course have essentially the same format that Alan had, which is you get the last issue with that numbering of your comic. But I don't think that you could look at them as being the same kind of thing at all. __EOS__ I asked this question to the man who did so much with the Sandman. Is Batman the most interesting character in comics? __EOS__ I've never thought of any character as being the most interesting character in comics. I don't there is the most interesting character in comics because the truth is, characters are as good as you write them. And the glory of great characters and the glory of great writers and creators is that point where you put a wonderful creator on a second, third, fourth or even a fifth-string character and suddenly you have Frank Miller doing Daredevil and everybody going, oh, Daredevil was such a great character, or Alan Moore doing something who was just considered a joke. ",0,,145," Did you actually have a choice, like yes I want to be a star, so make me a star?__EOS__ Well, I think what they meant by that was would I be game to go and do, you know, the massive amounts of promotion, would I be game to go and be photographed and this, that and the other and, you know, did I want to get out there, basically, into the media.__EOS__ Let me tell you, I see a lot of movies, and I'm so often frustrated. I mean, there's so many movies that aren't very good, and I guess you must feel that, too, as an actress, that there's a lot of stuff out there that you don't feel is worth your time.__EOS__ Some of I read, and I think why?",1,,146," Oh.__EOS__ And it was like, ow! She was hit like that. And it happened to be that her - the glass of her spectacles broke, but thank God she had nothing in her eye. Because you don't want to go to a concert and come with one eye out of the concert, right? But it's sometimes very dangerous. Yeah.__EOS__ Have you ever hurt yourself?__EOS__ Oh, very many, many times.",2,,147," Oh, there was salt. __EOS__ I'm thinking about that song Suitcase. Don't put too much salt in those black eyed peas. When we listen to your music, what other musical influences do we hear? __EOS__ Well, I was listening to popular music. I wasn't all that eclectic, you know, but because I played in a calypso band and we played steel drums, we were playing calypso music, so we were playing Latin-influenced music from the Caribbean. We listened to jazz records. Mongo Santa Maria was my favorite. A couple of us had little cheap conga drums that we had managed to scrounge up that we would just have our, like, little drum sessions out on my front porch. So we would just sit there, me and George Simpkins and Carlos County lived down the street, and the Thurman boys, they lived across the street. And we would just sit and bang out drums, you know, figuring it out, you know? Yeah. __EOS__ See. So in a sense I guess I was having tribal experience, not knowing what it was, really, you know, and then coming to the blues. ",2,,148," Struck a chord with me? I don't know.__EOS__ Just struck a chord with you. You remember?__EOS__ I just wrote the song. I wasn't thinking about it. I was just writing it. I'm not that deep. I'm not deep.__EOS__ Oh, OK.",2,,149,"  Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans, way back up in the woods among the evergreens, there stood a log cabin made of earth and wood, where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode... __EOS__ The amazing thing about ""Johnny B. Goode"" to me is that it sounds like a folk song. It sounds like a song that came out of the generations, just honed over generations, not written by an individual, and yet it's written by an individual. __EOS__  He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack, go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track... __EOS__ Sort of the apex of it to me, the apex of Chuck Berry's songwriting, because it sounds so natural, just something that any one who was the greatest songwriters of any generation would be proud of.

His teammate hits a pop-up foul ball down the third baseline. A-Rod has almost made it to third base. He's heading back to first and he takes the shortest possible route, I guess, which takes him right across the pitcher's mound. Breach of etiquette, what do you think? __EOS__ Yup. ",3,,151," Of course. __EOS__ I'm happy there. It's just there are certain moments and things and mainly just love-related things that make me periodically sad. And I'm happy that I have the ability to write about them. __EOS__ Yeah. You're brought your guitar along, right? __EOS__ Yes. ",2,,152," I remember it all. __EOS__ Okay. So with all that great stuff on the bookshelves and the Weavers on the turntable, it must've really helped you fall in love with books. __EOS__ It helped me fall in love with the whole world, except for sports... __EOS__ But do you know what I mean? It's just - the world was all there. I loved books but I loved art, I loved - you know, and it was all there for the taking. And, you know, children are sponges, and I was incredibly lucky to have such extraordinary stuff to soak up. Yeah, it really did. ",3,,153," Actually, I would say perhaps not. I have written only two books that feature people that could even be remotely described as serial killers, and I hear it's pretty close to the real-life description, which is not a super-genius, Hannibal Lecter-type person, but usually a person of slightly below-average IQ, but possibly with a sense of being more intelligent, more powerful than he is. And it usually is a he. There have been very few female serial killers.__EOS__ Laura Lippman joined us from member station WYPR in Baltimore.

Thank you.",1,,154," Yeah. __EOS__ As you travel about, do you feel that Islamists are gaining more power and influence, day by day? __EOS__ Well, I think they are, now, the only organized force, so they are gaining ground while the other parties - the parties of the young people and others who made the - triggered the Revolution - are just about starting their own parties. And that's also one of the reasons I believe that having the election in September is way too soon, because you would not have a level playing field at that time. The new parties are not yet fully engaged. __EOS__ Now, let me ask you about this book, which I'll mention is called ""The Age of Deception,"" and it covers what I guess we can now think of as your previous life - running the International Atomic Energy Agency at a really momentous period, involving Iraq - U.S. invasion of Iraq, the Iran issue. You are working on issues relating to Libya, relating to North Korea. ",0,,155," temperature shifts, barometric shifts and so on.__EOS__ Wow. Sounds like something I'd see on ""Masterpiece Theatre.""__EOS__ They are - you're right. They're amazingly traumatic.

They are constantly kind of making political deals, you know, to kind of backtrack and not give the Freedom Riders the full support of the federal government. So they actually - to get out of the church, they make a deal with the governor of Alabama. They finally forced John Patterson to sign out - to sign the document that will call out the National Guard. So it seems like it's the governor of Alabama who's actually doing it. __EOS__ We're talking with Stanley Nelson, who's the director, writer and producer of a new film called ""Freedom Riders,"" that premieres Monday, May 16th on PBS series ""American Experience."" Also with us is former Freedom Rider Ernest ""Rip"" Patton. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. __EOS__ Yeah. In the film, it was actually Julian Bond who says it. I mean, you know, you don't want violence to happen outright. But, you know, doesn't that then bring publicity to our cause? You know, doesn't that heighten what we're doing, if something does happen? You know, if the Freedom Riders had been able to just ride through the South and get to New Orleans and the South kind of ignored them, then what would have happened? So as Julian puts it, you know, in some ways it's good for our cause if something happens. But you know, nowhere did they in any way imagine that the violence would be the violence that did happen. __EOS__ And I wonder, Rip Patton, younger person at that time, did you think nothing would happen? ",1,,158," Rayid, thank you. __EOS__ Yeah, can I just follow up? I'm curious  Is it a matter of journalists being intimidated to ask the question, or are they simply not doing due diligence in educating themselves about the issues? __EOS__ Well, there's been some world-class journalism on this subject. Right here in the United States, Gretchen Morgenson of the New York Times has a new book out today on the subject of what happened at Fannie Mae. __EOS__ two parties, they're the best we can do, let's live with them.

As society got swept up, he was the guy who lost out. __EOS__ So let's figure out the drama here. Theodore Roosevelt isn't president yet. He's assistant secretary of the Navy, and there's this tremendous debate building in the country about what to do. How did the drama play out? __EOS__ Well, Teddy Roosevelt, as assistant secretary of the Navy, did his best to get us into the war. He had the fleet ready to go take on the Spanish. He was constantly lobbying McKinley, and they were putting pressure. They were war hawks. ",0,,160," Absolutely. __EOS__ ...and beam ourselves somewhere. __EOS__ I wish we could. Every time I'm in an airport terminal, I wish I could. __EOS__ This is our place, this is our place, and we'd better take care of it. And sometimes, of course, you can be disgruntled. In a way, for example, I've worked in the jungle, and after real hardship I came to the conclusion  Yes, I love the jungle, however against my better judgment. But...

But I so did it. __EOS__  Oh, dear. __EOS__  After I drank it, I was sitting there and I didn't even feel buzzed, high, nothing, and I was like, OK, maybe I just - let me stand up, you know.  OK, so I stand up and I absolutely have no - it has no effect on me, and right then and there I got scared to death and I said, you have my attention, Lord. What are you trying to tell me?   ",2,,162," And Gertrude Ward was a really good example of that. __EOS__  Oh, swing low, chariot. I said, swing low, chariot... __EOS__ And, I mean, this was kind of a tough life. I mean, she didn't just let them sing in church and in community performances. She uprooted them - took them out of school and moved them to Vegas. __EOS__ She was so controlling. You know, some people think that she was so controlling, that she may have stressed Clara so much, that she, you know, died at a lot younger age than she, you know, necessarily would have.

He also does something more.__EOS__ Many of his tunes are known as Narco-Corridos; that's the name for ballades that tell stories of the drug trade. Authorities have been cracking down on those songs.__EOS__ Which is why El Komander says he's quitting. NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports.,2,,165," She had a way of carrying herself and an aura about her of strength that made it surprising that somebody who had such a strong personality would get in a situation like a recording situation and be really shy and intimidated by the whole thing. __EOS__ It's a contradiction that Dalton isn't around to resolve. She died in 1993. And if she gave any recorded interviews, they apparently don't survive. The mystery that surrounds her life may be part of the reason for her recent comeback.  __EOS__ Let's play that.  __EOS__ In the last two years, independent labels have put out three CDs' worth of reissued and unreleased material. ",2,,166," Oh, I would think it would be the bible of almost everybody. __EOS__ It does sound that the Internet here is - if not the ideal medium, the only medium I can imagine for such a work. You couldn't have a book this large or an encyclopedia, soダﾝ __EOS__ No, you can't. And the Internet is one of the technological keys to this whole project. We wouldn't have been able to think about this very seriously 20 years ago. Maybe it will still seem like a - well, it still seems like a dream 10 years ago when I started writing about it. The electronic encyclopedia - I remember one very prominent British colleague and a friend of mine wrote me when he saw an article I've written Ion this. What are you smoking, Ed? Well, now I hope that I can persuade in my lesson smoking anything. __EOS__ Well, Professor Wilson, thank you every much for talking with us about it. Good to talk to you again.

Best care ever - 65 Plymouth Valiant with a slant six. One of those in Mexico in the late '80s early '90s, the place was teaming one time. A Mexican cop stop may not for the usual reason, but because he wanted to buy my beautiful Valiant.  I told him. I guess that's going back a little ways. __EOS__ Well, I think  a genius, you know. Absolutely, it was a fantastic car. The Valiant was awesome. __EOS__ Here's another email. This one from Richard. I'm a 37-year-old car owner of an import car shop. My family bought a 2004 Chrysler Pacifica in 2005. We love this vehicle. Dual climate control that works, four heated seats, navigation in front with the driver, all wheel drive, power tailgate, an excellent audio system with a rear DVD, wireless with headsets that lets those in front to what we want to, decent mileage, side curtain airbags, the third seats fall down for the dogs to go to work, comfortable for six. America can build a great vehicle if they try. ",3,,171, And you gave it?__EOS__ And I broke down. I broke down and gave it on this one instance.__EOS__ You compromised.__EOS__ This one instance alone. This one instance and this one instance alone.,1,,172," It was the early 2000s. Social media was exploding. The Mexican drug war was escalating. Sinaloan kids were sharing music with LA kids. Omar says it was the perfect storm.__EOS__ Today Narco-Corridos are a multi-million dollar businesses. Dave Gaddis is a retired regional director for the DEA in Mexico.__EOS__ There are public relations campaigns by these cartels in order to establish a certain level of popularity, and I believe that some of these Corridos actually help them do that.__EOS__ It's commonly thought that these songs are commissioned by the drug lords. But El Komander says he has no ties to any cartel.",2,,173," Yes. That's definitely true. It actually is uncomfortable. Because you have a shortened tendon, it will feel tighter when you walk barefoot, or even in flats, if you are used to wearing high heels. So if you have been wearing high heels for years and years and decide that you want to go to flats, then you need - as with someone switching to barefoot running - you need to do it gradually.__EOS__ So let's talk about dealing with muscle soreness, the kind of soreness that can set in with overexertion or with, you know, a rigorous workout routine.__EOS__ That actually surprised me. I hang around with a lot of athletes, and there are many athletes who take that non-steroidal ibuprofen every day. They take it before they work out because they hope that it will have a prophylactic effect; that it will keep them from getting sore after they work out.__EOS__ Now, this doesn't apply to, say, the effects of ibuprofen in bruising.",0,,174,"  ...because they're blown into magazines so that they fall      out and you get--they get noticed.  Yeah, I thought that was one of the      most clever ones; very simple, a guy who just opts not to fill them out,      and at the end of a month or so he mails them back.  And since they're      pre-paid, the advertiser--the magazine gets hit with the expense. __EOS__  A lot of the annoyances that you detail which people try and      combat have to do with the telephone and telephone marketers.  In the      end, there's not much you can do to break through a phone tree, is there? __EOS__  The one tactic I did come up with for that was someone who      had found if you press the non-English option, often you get an operator      who does speak English, and you get one much more quickly than if you      follow the road you're supposed to follow. __EOS__  Of all of these strategies for fighting back that you pass along,      is there one that you find the most appealing or that people seem to      respond to the most?

Mason calling us from Manchester, New Hampshire. __EOS__ Yes, sir.

This is Kevin and Kevin's with us from Seaside in Florida. __EOS__ Hey, thank you very much for taking my call. __EOS__ Sure. ",3,,187," This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with the Israeli filmmaker Dror Moreh, whose Oscar-nominated documentary ""The Gatekeepers"" is based on interviews with six former Israeli intelligence chiefs. After spending their careers battling Palestinian militants and tracking down terrorists, they all expressed concerns about continued occupation of Palestinian territories. Moreh also directed a 2008 documentary about former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. I spoke with him Monday, the day after the Academy Awards presentation.__EOS__ No. I was surprised to the extent and to the depth of what they thought about it. You know, when you come to that kind of interviews, about - especially when you speak with security forces head and people that always, you think, saw the enemy through the binocular of the rifle, you think that they will be much more harsh, much more motivated by security questions. And I was surprised and shocked to hear that this is what they thought and this is what they think.__EOS__ As I listen to these officials give their perspectives, I wondered how much of this was new to them, or whether when they were in office or they were engaged in carrying out missions, they thought, hmm, we're on the wrong course here, and whether they ever told that to their, you know, their civilian policymakers. Do you know?__EOS__ It's an amazing question. It's a very important question, what you've asked now. And I've asked that question to each one of them  Why didn't you say those words when you were in office? So the question I would say is a bit complicated, because in one hand, they said, look, those meetings where we were in those offices with the prime minister who is the only and direct boss of the heads of the Shin Bet, we said those words sometimes in shoutings, that this policy will lead to this the that and that consequences, sometimes to bitter consequences.",1,,188," So has scholarship brought you any closer to or further from the church?__EOS__ Well, I wouldn't say it's brought me closer to the church. It's made me feel independent of the church, I guess is the way I would put it. Now, I - you know, I think I have a deep attachment to the Catholic Church, because it's - the same way as I do to my native country. You know, it's where I grew up...__EOS__ Which is Ireland.__EOS__ It's - indeed. Yes.",0,,189," I do, but I've never used it. And I've never downloaded music either, by the way. I've heard all about it. __EOS__ So, I know you have one more song, and it's from Colombia. And the genre is something called - and I don't know if I'm going to pronounce this correctly - but terapia? __EOS__ Terapia, yeah. It means therapy. It's a kind of music that develops in the dancehalls in coastal Colombia. I've made five trips now to collect music. It's just wonderful stuff and it's an incredible scene. It's outdoors, it's 120 degrees, it's sweating, hot. They have no midrange speakers anywhere, but these giant four-by-six-foot bass speakers all around.

He had--Don had a great      voice.  `You can play Chopin or one of those guys, and then just stand up      and let it rip.' And I put the whole act together and on opening      night--it was at the Chateau de Ville Dinner Theatre in Framingham,      Massachusetts--opening night I was terrified.  You know, I was--five      minute before I went on I was still trying to figure out how to take off      my bra gracefully. __EOS__  With one hand. __EOS__  With one hand, yeah.  And I was in the wings with Danny      Herman, my stage manager, and he said to me, `OK,' you know, `stay      calm. Everything's fine.'  And the lights went to black, the comedians      ran off the stage and in the wings on the other side of the stage I      noticed two policemen with dogs on leashes.  And I said, `Danny, why are      the policemen over there with dogs?'  And he said, `Oh, well, you know,      they're just here just in case.'  And I said, `In case what?'  And he      said, `If you actually show anything, they'll arrest you.'  And yeah, we      had everything timed so I played the final glissando on the piano and      ripped my bra off exactly when the blackout occurred. ",2,,192," Yeah. And it was a pretty extraordinary moment. And I think that kind of sums up their whole case. They didn't have a case. They had no option but to walk out. They've managed to successfully delay the hearing three times. And on the fourth time and the final hearing, they had no case to answer. So they had no choice but to walk out. But it was great for us as filmmakers to be in there at the court at the time and actually witness that. __EOS__ Well, I mean, I think they did have a choice and - but they chose to do that. And that shows an extraordinary level of disrespect for law, for international law. And that kind of sets a mark. And it was an incredibly thing to capture that on film because I don't think it happens very often. __EOS__ Then they utterly ignore the courts rulings. And, of course, Zimbabwe is a signatory to the SADC. And then the next scene we see is a still photograph of Mount Carmel burning. __EOS__ Yeah. I mean, it's tragic what happened to the farm, the farm workers and to the family themselves since that day of that ダ_ the final court case, when they won their case. Well, I don't want to giveaway too much to viewers who might tune in tonight and watch the film, but it's tragic what's happened to them as a family and them as a farm. But it symbolizes what's happened across the border in Zimbabwe.

Because, of course, being a traveling singer had a price for my father. You know?

I can only tell you what I do. I don't believe in a rehearsal process at all. It's more of a therapy session.

",1,,197," Let's take a call from Catherine in Fresno, California. Welcome to TALK OF THE NATION, Catherine.  __EOS__ Thank you. My comment was maybe a little off your topic, but I think it's worth noting. I teach high school, and Fresno, California, is a very diverse community. My classroom, in my high school - have mostly Asian, largely Hmong, students and mostly Mexican students, with a few Caucasian kids mixed in here and there. And I make up, typically, one of maybe four white people in the classroom at a given time. What we have talked through the history, the kids often ask why on earth did they care that someone was black or that someone was Jewish, or that someone was this or that? Young people of today literally don't take account of it. It doesn't occur to them that that's part of the measure of what's going on. __EOS__ Catherine, thanks for your call. Randall Kennedy, do you see that - that as generations start to change over, that some of these issues just are kind of aging themselves out? __EOS__ Absolutely. I mean, social scientists have taken a look at racial attitudes, and racial attitudes have changed dramatically, and they have a generational component to them. On the other hand, I don't think that we should fall prey to naivete. The fact of the matter is even amongst younger people, you know, there is racial prejudice. And that's going to, unfortunately, hang on for a good long while. ",0,,198," Mm. He orders the plane to take off again, and where does it go? __EOS__ He wants the plane to go to Mexico City. And people thought, well, that's crazy. You know, under the way that he wanted the plane to fly, it was a tremendous drag, so it would have to refuel in Reno, Nevada. So around midnight, the plane landed in Reno, the aft stairs dangling in the back, sparks flew, and FBI agents raided this plane. And one of the things they found when they went into the mall of the cabin was that some things were missing. One of them was a parachute, all the money and him. __EOS__ And him. He was not on the plane when it landed in Reno to refuel. So somewhere between Seattle and Reno, Nevada that night, the man who became known as D. B. Cooper, this hijacker, escaped. And the presumption is he jumps out of the plane with the parachute and escapes, makes an escape. At that point, what does the FBI do? __EOS__ The manhunt began that morning, and it was an epic manhunt that followed, I mean, one of the biggest in the nation's history. And one of the first things they tried to do, in addition to figuring out who he was, was where he landed. Now, this area of terrain to search is some of the most remote, if not the most remote in this country. It is where Big Foot lives. ",0,,199," Yeah, it is broken I think, Steve. You know, this is with a system that was built in 1970. Lots of things happened in the last 40 years. Lots of countries now have that ability to develop nuclear weapon or have the know-how to develop nuclear weapons. So the weapon states need to send the message loud and clear; and not just a message, but act on it, walk the walk, that they are moving towards a world free from nuclear weapons. If you are not going to do that, in the long term, you cannot have a system of security based on nuclear haves and nuclear-have nots. The system of security, based on nuclear deterrence, is an absolute way to self-destruct. __EOS__ Mohammed ElBaradei is the author of ""The Age of Deception.""

They slip around. __EOS__ And indeed, this becomes important in Germany later, the battle between northern Germans, or the Prussians, if you will, who are from Weimar, and the soft, civilized, Romanized, if you will, Germans in Vienna. __EOS__ In Vienna, yeah. Also the Viennese being Catholic, that was a big deal. In the 19th century, part of being really the right kind of white person, that is to say Teutonic or Saxon or German, you also had to be Protestant. ",0,,201," Well, I know your first question is, is he related to former Iowa senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper. __EOS__ And, yes, there is a relation. A lot of people ask me that. He has announced this week. Bill Ritter is the Democratic governor who surprised everybody last week by saying he wouldn't run again. Hickenlooper is very popular but he's very liberal. And Republicans insist that he can't win statewide. Democrats think they have the best candidate in Hickenlooper. __EOS__ New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu there. __EOS__ Well, Mitch Landrieu is, of course, the brother of...

And what was sort of surprising, I was talking to Joe about this when we were shooting the movie, he's, likeダﾝ __EOS__ Joe, the lead actor. __EOS__ Joe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, of course, the lead actor playing Tom, and he said they don't normally know what the music is before you shoot. And that, to me, just seems strange because it lets them know the tone that you're after. And I think that's a really important thing for an actor to know or to feel before you shoot a scene. ",2,,203,"  6 00 A.M. day after Christmas, I throw some clothes on in the dark. __EOS__ Now, Ben Folds is harnessing the power of sing-alongs in a different way. __EOS__  The world is sleeping and I am numb. __EOS__ For his latest CD, he's commissioned arrangements of his music from some of the country's best college vocal troupes. The CD is called ""Ben Folds Presents University A Cappella."" ",2,,204," That was the whole idea really because we thought, you know, as Westerners going there, we only took, like, 10 crew. The rest of the crew are from - drawn from Bollywood. But I thought, as a Westerner going there and trying to make a film about a kid growing up there, they're just going to have to film the film as subjectively as possible and just literally tip the audience in off the edge of a cliff and just see how you get on. And the way we did that was through this chase sequence at the beginning, where you literally - there's no, like, wide shots where you go, hello, everybody, this is India. Hello, everybody, this is Mumbai, and you know, it's actually - so, you don't settle people into the film. You just hurtle them into it full pull, and that's what it's like arriving there.  __EOS__ You know, I don't want to get too technical, but it -when I looked at those chase scenes - and it's very tight quarters because people are crammed together, and their makeshift, you know, habitats are all very close - I couldn't imagine getting a sound boom and lighting and all the stuff that goes with the movie set. How did you film it? __EOS__ With a very small crew. There are very narrow lane ways, and obviously - I mean, as you probably know, in any community, a film crew is disruptive. You know, it disrupts the rhythm and access for a community. We were still very disruptive, but we took a small crew, and we filmed with very small digital cameras, which allowed us to capture the dynamism of the place, really, as well as actually not disrupt it too much ourselves. And people were very generous and welcoming to us. We filmed in two slums, a small slum by the airport called Juhu and an extraordinary slum, which is a slum of at least two million people - some say it's the biggest slum on Earth - called Dharavi. And that, you just - I mean, the chance to film there is obviously visually stunning because you're able to show a world to people that they often just see from a distance and often just with this - rather kind of like distancing title of ""a slum,"" you know? And it's rather a pejorative word in the way we use it. __EOS__ The characters in the film initially are presented to us as kids, like, little kids, preschool-age kids. ",3,,205,"  Really, really bad. __EOS__  You know it. You know I'm bad. I'm bad. You know it. __EOS__  Really, really bad. __EOS__ And in the middle of the song here, Michael Jackson and a whole gang of dancers are in the subway station. And why don't you talk about the moves that are going on here and how you choreographed this for him? ",2,,206," Yeah, except people still do. I mean, these best sellers - these books become best sellers for that reason. Well, I think one -another interesting thing is that people, they want to keep a certain image of Rhett Butler in their mind, and I know lots of people who've forgotten that what he does is to say he's going to go back and rejoin Charleston society, and wants a little bit of the grace and pleasure of life. __EOS__ How did her editors push for her to write a more acceptable and sanitized ending about the outcome? Let's just remind people how it ends. __EOS__  Rhett, if you go, where shall I go? What shall I do? __EOS__  Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. ",3,,207," The election of John Kennedy gave new hope, I think, to civil rights activists. Even though he didn't have a particularly strong record as a senator, had not shown a great interest in civil rights, he talked about a new frontier. __EOS__ When the Freedom Riders formed in 1961, did they have the same goal as the group in 1947 did, to try to force the government to enforce an already existent law that said that interstate bus travel could no longer be segregated? __EOS__ There were two landmark Supreme Court decisions  Morgan vs. Virginia in 1946, which seemed to outlaw segregation on interstate buses and, by argument, trains; but then in 1960, in December of 1960, there was a second decision, the Boynton vs. Virginia decision, which appeared to outlaw segregation in public accommodations related to interstate travel, so that you could get a cup of coffee at a lunch counter in a train station or in a bus station if you were involved in interstate transportation. __EOS__ Raymond Arsenault, speaking with Terry Gross. Arsenault is the author of the book ""Freedom Riders  1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice."" He'll be back in the second half of the show. Here's a 1963 recording of the CORE Freedom Singers, singing ""Get Your Rights, Jack,"" their own version of the Ray Charles hit.

The new civil rights is making sure that young people and people of color have not only access to capital, but to be a part of trading that capital that young people need to be able to access. __EOS__ What kind of legacy do you want to pass on in terms of giving something to younger people who might look up to you from your district, telling them that they have a chance? And let me fold that into your other position. You have so many hats. __EOS__ Well, A, people look for good government. And that's what we want to give them. I think what's also important to look at the work of the Ways and Means Committee has to do. A, we have to be able to allow the federal government negotiate with drug companies to bring prices down; not to make the program a bad program for those that are involved, but to improve it. __EOS__ Congressman, specifically on Iraq, you served on a House Armed Services Committee.

Robert Call, who is a lead technician at the Kenworth Truck Assembly Plant in Chillicothe, Ohio. __EOS__ You know what, I thought the president did an excellent job overall. I think he definitely accomplished his primary goals of refocusing on getting people back to work and gaining back trust. __EOS__ Now, weve been talking about health care over the past year and you were really against idea of a public option at one point. Are you more satisfied thinking that there might not be any big health care bill and that there might be the health care bill thats in the Congress? ",3,,210," Do I sound like a curmudgeon? __EOS__ No, you don't. __EOS__ Well, the idea behind ""A Little Book of Language"" - of course, that title is quite interesting, isn't it, because it's a title that is an echo of an earlier book that many of your listeners may have read - or even may have read to them at bedtime once. __EOS__ We're talking with David Crystal.

But all of our history, it's always been true, whenever the economy has changed and said, wow, we need a whole lot of people doing office work, suddenly the idea of a woman working before she got married for a while was regarded as a good wholesome way to prepare yourself for married life somehow. It's always that way. The economy decides something's necessary and then our thinking kind of fits around it. __EOS__ I feel like reading this, that you do get a sense of women not necessarily grasping an opportunity, but assuming an economic obligation. __EOS__ Yeah, well, for some women it's both. When you open up things like this, for some women it's breaking open the doors and opening the windows and just say, okay, fly. But for many, many, many women, it's a question of what you need to do to take care of yourself, to take care of your family. __EOS__ When you look at some of the statistics from recent times, particularly when you look at things like college admittance or college graduation and the way that young women now outnumber young men at institution after institution, does that make you feel that the story you try to tell of women's rights changing over the last half century, do you feel like that story is over, it's done? ",0,,213," Good afternoon. __EOS__ Thanks for having us. __EOS__ This is tough stuff. This was tough to watch. How tough was it to make? __EOS__ It was tough to make as well. You know, we shot, obviously, in Brownsville, which is a place where the police basically told us you were on your own if you go in there. The environment itself is very dangerous. The subject matter, it's draining and emotional and a little scary when you actually stop and think about the issue of what we're really dealing with. ",1,,214," Anu, I'm going to ask you, since you are an advocate. You've been working on this for quite some time. In fact, this is one of the main reasons that your organization was founded. What are the recommendations that you are making and do you have any confidence that you are getting a hearing now, given all of these issues that are now before the public?__EOS__ Well, we have two sweeping recommendations. The first involves the military criminal justice system as it exists and we want to professionalize the process for both victims and the accused; which is to say that commanders should have nothing to do with whether or not a case goes to trial and certainly should never be given the authority to, you know, reverse a conviction. Really, prosecutors are the folks who should be dealing with these issues, just trained lawyers, period.__EOS__ Jennifer, before we let you go, I wanted to give you the final word as a person who's reported on this as the new Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, who just recently came back from his first overseas trip, a very dramatic one. Has he indicated that he believes this is an area that needs to change?__EOS__ He has. During his confirmation hearing, he was asked about it and he said that he wanted to make it an important issue that he would focus on and he - with the Lieutenant Colonel Wilkerson case, he had said that he was going to review it. I think that he's definitely looking into it, and he's not just looking into that case because, unfortunately, he actually can't do a lot about that case. But, as far as the authorities that are in place that allowed that situation to happen, he is looking at that.",3,,215," So in North America, when the settlers were fighting wars with the Indians, the Indians that they were fighting with, the Native Americans they were fighting with, were survivors of these plagues?__EOS__ Yes, they were, by and large, people, you know, who were in a state of complete cultural shock because, you know, two-thirds of the people that they knew had died. And there is just no culture that can resist foreign invasion, even by small bands of people like the Europeans were, when you've just had this enormous, shattering experience.__EOS__ So you were talking about how Columbus and subsequent explorers brought with them to the New World domesticated animals like horses, cows, pigs, chickens, and, you know, how on the one hand, you know, this brought a lot of disease, but at the same time, it created, you know, opportunities.__EOS__ Well, they did in some cases, but they were - it was a recent innovation. What happened is the Spaniards brought horses to Mexico in the early 16th century, and it took the Native people no time at all to realize what a great thing this was. And they began stealing them, you know, basically as soon as Cortez arrived and funneling them up into the north.",0,,216," Yeah, but also bringing to that 40 years of socialization of being female, makes it really hard to know what are the rules, and how do you do this? __EOS__ Exactly. __EOS__ What's the hardest part? __EOS__ Beg your pardon? ",0,,217," We're speaking with actor Ewan McGregor. __EOS__ If you're just joining us, we're speaking with actor Ewan McGregor. One of your early successful films was ""Trainspotting,"" which was - you did with Danny Boyle, and a film, I guess about a group of heroin addicts in Scotland. And I thought we might listen to a piece of this. This is from kind of the opening of the film. Let's listen. __EOS__   Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance. Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. Choose leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of  fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who the  you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch, watching mind-numbing spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing  junk food into your mouth. __EOS__ And that's my guest Ewan McGregor from the opening of the film ""Trainspotting."" That takes you back to earlier in your career. And we hear a very thick Scottish brogue there. Is that what you sounded like as a young man in Scotland? ",1,,218," There are cool suits available. It's an aftermarket product from the same manufacturer. Unfortunately, in New York, they told us it was only two months of summer of warm weather up here, so we didn't get them. But you - your time in that suit is probably looking at a 20-minute window, 22 minutes, before your body core temperature starts to rise and it becomes a health issue. __EOS__ So it's a little like going into a scuba dive, going underwater. __EOS__ Correct. __EOS__ And interesting, the armor in those suits - in reading the book - the armor is all in front, so you - even if you're backing away from a bomb, you back away from it. ",0,,219," We're really accessing brains all over the world. One of the beautiful uses of the Internet, at least, is in this way for music. We are sort of in touch - Einstein called it spooky action at a distance - with people all across the world. And they don't know they're working with you on your record. But there's some sort of resonance built up there, and that was something that really did turn us on. __EOS__ Jeff Mercel, where on this new CD can we hear a good example of what came out of this? __EOS__ Well, ""Dream of a Young Girl as a Flower,"" for example. It's all over the place from things like the vocals, as well as the drums and instrumentation. You'd find programs that do things as commonplace to a reverb or a delay, to other things that would have German names that you couldn't even pronounce, that they'd have knobs and buttons on them that you didn't even know what they were meant to do. And on some of these you couldn't tell if they were actually performing the way that they were meant to or if they were malfunctioning. And sometimes the malfunctioning ones were infinitely more interesting to us than the ones that were actually doing what they were meant to do. __EOS__ Let's listen. ",2,,220," Ah. __EOS__ My daughter has a behavioral - she has obsessive compulsive and defiance disorder. __EOS__ Which leads us to ask Dr. Jenike, is there a genetic element to that? __EOS__ Exactly. So I believeダﾝ ",0,,221," What is a secret, actually? And, you know, it's - because you have competing populations in the brain, if you have one part that wants to tell something and another part that does not want to because of maybe the social consequences of revealing something like this, that's a secret.__EOS__ Who is talking to whom here, right, because it's all you when you're angry at yourself.__EOS__ Don't eat it, you'll get fat. You'll have to go to the gym tomorrow and so on.__EOS__ So does doing research like this make you really self-conscious about the arguments that you're having within yourself?",0,,222," You also say, about the bedroom, that for a lot of people, the bedroom was the room. I mean, you basically had a room to live in, and it was the everything room.__EOS__ Yes. If you think of, you know, the basic medieval cottage, it's just one single space, it's used for everything  cooking; any leisure, which would be very limited; sleeping; the washing that did take place and probably working, as well.__EOS__ You know, one thing I kept wondering, reading your book ""If Walls Could Talk"" is how much of the history of the home, as you describe it, applies to America. And of course, in medieval times in the U.S., the population was Native American, and their home arrangements were different than England.__EOS__ I think it owes a lot to the European tradition, doesn't it? You can see - and in fact, some parts of European history survive in America where they don't in the U.K. For example, the Tudors invented a special new room in the house called the closet, and the closet is a lovely little room. It's richly decorated. It's private. It's off the bed chamber, and it was originally used for the storing of precious arts and treasures, and it was used for praying.",0,,223," Well, a writer, Nnedi Okorafor, who won the prize in 2011 - her book was called ""Who Fears Death."" Someone mentioned to her this poem that Lovecraft had written that was just incredibly racist. And she saw it and she became completely dismayed and hurt by the fact that this professional honor, which she had been so proud to receive, was in the shape of the head of a man who would think these kinds of things about someone like her.__EOS__ Nnedi Okorafor being a Nigerian-American writer.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ And this poem is noxious. We couldn't say the title of it on the radio.",3,,224," I love the way you write about Mary Lincoln.__EOS__ Thank you, Scott.__EOS__ Years before children and the success he had as a corporate lawyer and the Civil War and the immense human suffering that in many ways they share in their family and the immense suffering of the war kind of complicated their lives. What brought Abe Lincoln and Mary Lincoln, as we might say high-born, together?__EOS__ Sex. See, people...",0,,225," Why pure escapism right now, why? __EOS__ Well, in this environment - of what's going on economically and with nature and things that happen, there needs to be some sort of escape, some sort of place that people can go to forget about their problems and to have joy, to have that pure joy. And it's not about having money, because some of the best memories that we've had are with family and friends when we didn't have any money. You always remember those memories. So it's about creating new memories for people, just bringing together people for music, for the love of music and for having a good time with their family and friends, because in the end, those are the things you remember. __EOS__  One Tribe, one time, one planet, one race. Its all one blood, don't care about your face. The color of your eye or the tone of your skin. Don't care where ya are. Don't care where ya been because where we going to go is where we want to be. The place where the little language is unity. And the continent is called Pangaea and the main ideas are connected like a spear. __EOS__ And just another question. What does it like right now? You're sort of at the pinnacle of success right now and that I would think that's a little extra - does it put extra pressure on you or you're enjoying it or do you feel pressured by it? ",2,,226," Oh, thank you, Robert.__EOS__ I should explain that 25 years ago, you were booking interviews for ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.__EOS__ That's right.__EOS__ I guess, about 25 years ago, the guys who made this film were young and living like there was no tomorrow.",1,,227," So let's get to this famous Stephen Sondheim letter.__EOS__ Before the show even started previewing, there was a feature story written in The New York Times about the show that quoted you and the writer and the director - you know, the writer who adapted it, and the director. And Stephen Sondheim wrote this, like, scathing letter in response. And you're not supposed to review a show before it opens. He said  I'm not reviewing the show.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ I'm just talking about what the creators of this adaptation said about the show.",3,,228," And we meet one family in particular who's interested in surrogacy to earn the money, well, not only to educate their son - they want him to be an officer in the Indian Army - but also to build a house. And interestingly, that is the same motivation for the woman from whom they get the eggs in this. And she is from Tennessee and we also meet her online. __EOS__ My name is Catherine Galleon. I'm 28 years old and I work through Egg Donation Incorporated, donating my eggs to couples that are not able to produce healthy children with the mother's eggs. I'm about 5'10. I weigh 130 pounds. I have brown hair and green eyes. I'm tall and fairly athletic. __EOS__ And she has donated eggs once and we see her go through the process of donating them again, indeed, injecting herself with the fertility drugs, at which moment she tells us, yes, essentially I'm being treated like a robot. __EOS__ Yes. In terms of, you know, when you take fertility drugs for the IVF treatment, is the doctors are - you know, even if you're a customarily reserved, the doctors are taking care of everything. ",1,,229," Finally, we stir in the herbs and take a taste. __EOS__ Mm. I'm sorry, I just love the basil, right? __EOS__ That's awesome, yeah. It's great. I think that might even be better than tarragon. What do you think? __EOS__ I love it. But you know what, I have one in the refrigerator because I had to make one before you all came and you can taste it with the tarragon and you've tasted this. So, I am happy that they didn't have tarragon at the store. ",3,,230," But I find it such a paradox in what you spelled out there. That you're the person who has like defied every convention in your life and in your art -the person who, you say, even you're a minority group, you're an outsider of. And, I mean, you turn that into an art and a career. And yet, you tried to get your psychiatrist to love you, and you say that every day in your life is a campaign for popularity. Isn't that a paradox? __EOS__ No. I think it's probably being a healthy neurotic - everything that I'm trying to be. __EOS__ A healthy neurotic, huh? __EOS__ Yeah. Only... ",0,,231," Is that a joke that's commonly made in Hollywood?__EOS__ No, I think in truth what it's about and why I like the joke is it's sort of got two - one aspect is yes, there I am, I'm the director. He's saying it to me. It has that kind of cuteness to it. But, really, it speaks to something that people don't often think about Hollywood, which is the kind of class hierarchy, that this above-the-line, this narrow strip of people - director, star, sort of prima donna, that kind of thing - and then the huge - they're sort of the icing, right - and then the huge bulk of the cake, who are all the workaday people, the lunch-pail folks who do that job.__EOS__ So as we heard, like the tone really shifts back and forth in the movie between, you know, drama, where everything is at stake, and comedy. And the comedy parts are, of course, in Hollywood, where this cover story is being created, and where real Hollywood and fake Hollywood collide and that parts of real Hollywood it's colliding with are sometimes, like, really cheap, like low-budgety parts.__EOS__ Yeah, low and B sci-fi stuff, yeah.",1,,232," Sure. Crystelle is a woman from West Philadelphia who grows up in a community where there is a lot of love, a strong sense of family where residents work very hard. __EOS__ You know, there have been so many books - Beloved comes to mind - that deal with that liminal space between life and death. What brought you in that direction? __EOS__ I'll tell you, I was sitting on a stoop in Washington D.C. It was 1988 or 1989. And as I was sitting there there were two young women who were walking past me, and one was talking to the other and she said to her girlfriend, I'm just going to go on and have his baby before he gets locked up or shot up or something. And her voice guided me to this story. __EOS__ You paint a picture of her being someone who has transcended the ghetto, so to speak. That is something that I don't think gets talked about enough, it's like what happens when you leave one situation, one understanding of what the black community is, and you move on to another one. ",0,,233, Sure.__EOS__ Would you really?__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ That's disgusting.,3,,234," So when you had the hit of ""Short Shorts,"" you were about 15. Were you exploited as a kid? Did people try to take advantage of you in the music industry?__EOS__ Well, I learned a very big lesson very early on. We found out when we changed - I think actually we acquired a big-time attorney after about six months in having some success in realizing we really didn't know what we were doing. And he did a search - which is standard for copyright search - and found out that the song ""Short Shorts"" was copyrighted under someone else's name, which turned out to be our managers.__EOS__ Whoa.__EOS__ That was the first awakening. You know, if we didn't get an attorney or have someone sharp, who knows where it would've gone because I don't know how long it is before you contest something, but I suspect we might have been screwed.",2,,235," The Beatles broke up. Led Zeppelin broke up. Jimi Hendrix even broke up his group and formed another group. Public Enemy broke up. It just -it happens. __EOS__ In the story Michael Rapaport tries to tell in his film, Tribe broke up because Q-Tip and Phife vied for control and credit. But the story the band tells is different. While they were in the studio, their world was changing. __EOS__ The largest difference between the hip-hop game now and back then is that people make songs. They don't do projects. We did projects. Notice I didn't even say album. We did projects. __EOS__ I just know about my group and why we came together. But the way I see it, as of right now, you don't see a lot of that because you have to split that money three, four ways.

Let's have a good ending to the story?__EOS__  Pat, you owe us an apology.__EOS__ Mom, for what? I can't apologize. I'm not going to apologize for this. You know what I will do? I will apologize on the behalf of Ernest Hemingway.__EOS__  Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologize to us, too.",1,,238," Yet, for example, for many years, Turkey was Israel's closest ally in the Middle East...__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ ...in terms of cooperation.__EOS__ Right.",0,,239," In the book there are campaign posters, a vote for Oliver Watson is a vote for America, when you began to write the book, did you know that you wanted to include so many of these visual elements? __EOS__ I did. I did. Yeah. I kind of wanted to feel like a dossier, like, you know, there is transcripts of conversations and photographs taken from hidden cameras. I wanted to - it to feel it was a - this could have really happened. This is an actual file from an actual fat kid's actual secret lair. __EOS__ Adding the pages of pictures and stuff wasn't just a way to bump up the page count. __EOS__ It was absolutely not. I want people to think this kid could really exist. He's out there and he's plotting.

Because the thing about Dean Reed - because so few people in America or Europe knew who he was, the whole time I was researching it, every time I'd meet a person who actually had seen him or knew him it was, it gave it this fantastic reality for me. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. Tikay, do you remember any of his music? __EOS__ Well, what was important for me, as a musician, is that he was an American singer singing songs, for example, that weren't being sung by other American singers. I think he sang a lot of songs by Pete Seeger and probably  at that time. And so it was interesting to see somebody who looked so, quote, ダ_Americanダ icon. He was blond and blue-eyes, tall and very, very muscled. Good looking, and then - but he was singing other types of songs that weren't played on the radio. __EOS__ Dean Reed. And, well, I think, Tikay, some of the stuff you were referring to probably didn't have a lot of strings behind it. ",0,,242," When you're writing, where's an image like that come from?__EOS__ I think the best place is like when you're a kid of someone reads you picture book. You've got such a vivid imagination of like what's going on, even if there's no pictures. Then you just conjure up all these images in your head that's so unique to you, but they're so vivid.__EOS__  I guess I would leave this world alone. Without you I'm just bones. I guess I would leave this world alone. Without you I'm just bones.__EOS__ When you were growing up and listening to music in London, could you recount for us what the image you had in your mind of Jimi Hendrix was?",2,,243," Irregular habits meant regular drinking.__EOS__ Regular drinking. He had a reputation for not showing up at the appointed time, often because he was drunk, sometimes because he had been out partying all night and just didn't feel like getting out of bed. But more important than that, Hammett was, at that time, becoming political active and he was involved in the Screenwriters Guild, a unionization effort of the screenwriters, to force the studios to give the writers credit and money for the work that they did.__EOS__ And he'd also been at least briefly a communist.__EOS__ No. It wasn't briefly - it was a long-term commitment. He was a member of the Communist Party, card-carrying. He apparently joined the party in about 1935, at about the time he was - just before the time he was writing after ""After the Thin Man."" And he remained a member of the party, you know, for the next, what, two decades.",1,,244," And I guess there are sometimes that you would just as soon see an account deleted. And I noticed that one company has a feature called Account Incinerator. __EOS__ That's right. Obviously, there are accounts that people create during their life that they dont want handed down to their children or their spouse and they want to be permanently gone. And there's a company called Entrustit, and theyve actually, as part of their service, you can set up certain accounts that will automatically get deleted once you've passed away. __EOS__ You know, weve been talking a lot about pictures, emails and other kinds of content. You know, more and more people have financial information that they have online access to and there are usernames and passwords that could really be valuable. Do you include that kind of information in your digital inventory and your instructions as well? __EOS__ So it's our recommendation that you, of course, realize that anything that has sort of a financial matter should be executed according to your legal will, as we like to call it, that provide a differentiation between your digital estate planning.

He did read the story finally and he was - he was more okay with it than my mother. But he, I think, blocked it out to a certain extent. But when I was a kid I think I went into the woods and that's when I really felt when all this stuff - I'd never been abandoned before in any way. __EOS__ How do you write about Phoebe, this character who leaves her son with no explanation, without turning her on the page into some kind of maternal monster, some sort of demon, because it's a fictional character but it's your mother also. __EOS__ Yeah. You know, I didn't see her as a monster. But when my mom read the story recently, she said why did you depict me as a drunk loser? I'm like, I don't think, you know, I depicted you as a drunk loser. I think that in the story the mother is the one who encourages the character Jeremy to express himself creatively and to find his creative voice. And in the end, she tells him the story about this king who kept birds in cages, and he would pierce their eyes and blind them in order - so that they would sing to their full potential. __EOS__ In the book, Jeremy yearns for an explanation or at least an apology. Did you ever get that from your mother, or is that even important? ",3,,247," The main thing is my family.__EOS__ You know, ordinarily, we'd hear music like yours and say, where does she live in Brooklyn?__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ So that's why I ask why you're in Detroit.",2,,248," So, Meg Keene, you've written that DIY is actually traditional.__EOS__ Well, you know, people have been doing it themselves for a very long time. You know, I talked a lot about the idea of doing it together because I think DIY has become this sort of crazy, all-consuming, I-need-to-make-it-all contest. But for time immemorial, it used to be the women of the family. But the women of the family sort of pulled together and pulled off a day that was a celebration of an important moment but not the be-all, end-all of our lives. So I think maybe we were on to something.__EOS__ Let's get another listener. Janice in Nevada, Iowa?__EOS__ It's Nevada, Iowa.",0,,249," So from your perspective as an historian, what interests you about Glenn Beck's history lessons on his show and through his new university? __EOS__ Right. Well, Glenn Beck is trying to give you a version of American history that is supposedly hidden. Supposedly, all we historians -left, right and center - have been doing for the past 100 years is to keep true American history from you. And that true American history is what Glenn Beck is teaching. __EOS__ So he referred to Colonel House in what we heard, and he said in order to understand Woodrow Wilson, FDR or Obama, you have to know about this guy. So who is Colonel House? __EOS__ Colonel Edward House was a very close advisor of Woodrow Wilson's, and Beck has been on him for a long time. He wrote novels. He did all kinds of things. But he was a close advisor of Wilson's, and he had a lot to do with the installation, particularly, of the Federal Reserve system in 1913. He was pushing for that, a way to try and put a brake on financial panics, which had ravaged the economy, American economy, the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.

I've often said that when Oprah goes off the air, I think it's going to be like, think about you live in a neighborhood and you have a really great friend across the fence or around the corner, and every day, like, 3 or 4 o'clock they come over and y'all drink coffee and you talk about things that matter to the two of you and that's just a big part of your life. And then one day she says, I'm moving away. I'm sorry, but I'm moving a couple thousand miles away. I won't be here every day. __EOS__ Well, what about for you, though? As I understand it, you are still very dear friends. The two of you are very good, good friends. But is it - your show is going to continue - is it a change for you? Is it a loss for you? Is there some sadness for you? __EOS__ Well, you know, I'm in a unique situation because we are very close friends and we continue to work together. And she's always been my mentor and helper on the Dr. Phil show, and of course that will continue. And then I'm very involved in the Oprah Winfrey Network, doing a number of projects. So I'm one of those lucky few that gets to continue to have her in my life on an ongoing basis. So I feel very fortunate about that. ",3,,252,"  The mainstream Western attitude has held that, in its fundamentals, the world will be relatively little changed by China's rise. This is based on three key assumptions  that China's challenge will be primarily economic in nature; that China will in due course become a typical Western nation; and that the international system will remain broadly as it is now with China acquiescing in the status quo and becoming a compliant member of the international community. Each of these assumptions is misconceived. The rise of China will change the world in the most profound ways. __EOS__ Now, Martin Jacques' provocative thesis was influenced, he says, by a lifetime of watching the decline of the British Empire. __EOS__ The history of humanity is the rise and fall of countries and civilizations and so on, so nothing is cast in stone, and the United States has enjoyed actually quite a long period in the sun, ever since certainly 1945. And I think that it's not so much what's wrong with the United States, although I think there are problems, it's more that the last 30 years has seen an extraordinary transformation in China and not only China but other countries, as well, India and so on, but China's the most striking example. And this is the backdrop to the shift in power. __EOS__ When you talk to Chinese experts in China, they say China does not have global ambitions; China has regional ambitions. There is nothing to fear of China. ",0,,253," . Well, the intended effects are pretty easy. I mean, the unintended effects, of course, are harder to predict. But, the intended effect, I think, immediately you know you can say it's to destroy you know, ISIS - degrade and destroy ISIS. But I think the real purpose attacking them in Syria is to basically bolster the government in Iraq. Because I think honestly, we're not at the point where intervening - at least, I think the feeling in the White House is that intervening in the middle of the Syrian civil war is going to sway it one way or another. It's just a giant, you know, knife fight.__EOS__ Do you agree with that analysis?__EOS__ It's hard to say. I think that if you look at the available evidence, ISIS - look, it's led by a megalomaniacal psychopath, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He's clearly a murderous individual. They've beheaded and kidnapped a number of Americans. But it's not entirely clear to me that at the moment they pose a threat to the United States or to Europe. And they may. I think they may at some point. And I think that - but my sense is that the danger that ISIS poses is not so much to the United States or to Europe, you know, today or tomorrow, but it's to the region, to the entire Middle East. And I think the fear is is that if the United States doesn't do something to stop ISIS now in Syria and Iraq then, you know, potentially the monarchy in Jordan could collapse and potentially further down the road, Saudi Arabia and potentially Lebanon. So you're talking about - you know, you're talking about potentially, a really calamitous situation that's going to take years and years to fix.__EOS__ So did ISIS in a way give the United States an opportunity to go into Syria? Like, everybody knows now what ISIS is. I'd never heard of the Khorasan group until this week.",3,,254," Well, I think it's a time where we're not having those opportunities to tell our story.

I'm just one person that can go out to the schools, and the demand and requests from the schools is enormous.__EOS__ David Rice, you cockeyed optimist, you.__EOS__ Well, you know - you know, look. We can go on for hours about this, and Sandra's right.

And we're not in the canon.__EOS__ Maybe one writer here or there, but, you know...",0,,255," Do you foresee a time, as we look forward to November, when we might see, you know, an establishment Republican leader, a Tea Party leader, sort of hold a summit in some backyard some way, shake hands and say, like, let's go into November together? I mean, can the Republican Party reconcile with this movement? __EOS__ Oh, I think so. I mean, I think there are going to be real growing pains here. The Republicans started off on the wrong foot with the Tea Party. They didn't really know what to make of them. The Tea Party is incredibly suspicious of anything that reeks of the establishment. __EOS__ To get rid of the Democrats, we have to get rid of the Republicans. __EOS__ Kate Zernike, New York Times reporter.

She says she longs for the days of Joni Mitchell and Janis Joplin. And that got NPR's Neda Ulaby thinking about American music's newest female icons. __EOS__ Ann Powers, chief pop critic of the Los Angeles Times, thinks Piper Kaplan is exactly wrong. __EOS__ This era is an amazing time for young women musicians, young women songwriters, young women who, to me, seem to be very involved, if not completely in charge of their own careers.

For instance, here are two bands - same music, same period - which do you think sounds more ladylike? Here's band number one.",2,,258," This reminds me of something that your narrator says about his father. He says that his father, historically speaking, probably missed being sensitive by eight to 10 years, depending on where you date the new man era.__EOS__ For sure, yeah.__EOS__ How many years did your father miss the new man era by?__EOS__ Oh, I think he missed it by more than eight to 10.",0,,259," Basically, until 1996, our law said it was illegal for any company to own more than four stations in one market, and more than 40 radio stations nationally. In 1996, after a push from the Republican Congress - Newt Gingrich's Contract with America Congress - and after approval from President Clinton, we passed the - a telecommunications act that eliminated the national ownership cap all together, and raised the local caps from 4 to 8. __EOS__ Let me go back to an earlier point, though. How were broadcast licenses distributed to begin with, and who did they go to? __EOS__ Well, from a very early moment in this country, from the - in fact, the Communications Act of 1934 that set up the FCC - the nation's large corporations were able to win the rights for broadcast licenses through federal auctions. And they did so in a way that actually squeezed a lot of amateur and independent broadcasters off the airwaves. __EOS__ So Eric, what's going on today in terms of producing new broadcast licenses? Is that even possible? ",0,,260," Then later, your family moves to Pakistan, to a refugee camp, first in Quetta and then up in - near Peshawar. And these are - well, million of Afghans were forced into refugee status during the struggle against the Soviet occupation and later during the civil war. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ But this was where you first became exposed to the politics as you tried to go to school to get an education. __EOS__ Yeah. Like, as you said, like many Afghan, millions of Afghan, we also become refugee and because Iran was not - no school for a garrison -Afghan  in Pakistan . And on that time, a refugee  class in high school when I was, I thought to be a social activist. And in the morning I was a student of the school, in the evening I was a teacher for literacy courses. ",0,,261," I am. And I'm running slowly. I'm running carefully. I'm running a little smarter, and that's certainly something that all runners need to be aware of - is, if you hurt yourself, you then have to be a little smarter. The single biggest risk factor for a running injury is a prior running injury. So if you've hurt yourself in the past, you probably need to change a little bit about how you run. You may need to warm up a little more. Some people like to switch to trails. There's not actually much science showing that the surface matters, but it definitely matters how many miles you do. And I'm running a fewer miles now, than I was.__EOS__ Now, what about the pros and cons of running when it comes to hips and knees?__EOS__ Well, the science is very encouraging - in terms of both, as a matter of fact. There's a very strong myth that running will ruin your knees. And anyone who has run for as many years as I have has had people say to them, you're going to ruin your knees. Well that, scientifically, is just not true. The science actually shows that if you have a healthy knee to start with, running tends to increase the amount of cartilage that you produce. It prompts the cartilage cells - which are the shock absorbers in your knee - it prompts them to divide and produce more cartilage. So in theory, running is actually healthy for your knees.__EOS__ Let's talk a little bit about running shoes - and walking shoes, too. Some of the common wisdom about running shoes, apparently, is being disproven.",0,,262," No.  __EOS__ I'm going to give a short answer. We got rid of slavery by giving people property rights in themselves. What is that slaves do not have? They don't have any property rights at all, and they don't have the first and most fundamental property right, which is the right to sell. __EOS__ But we got rid of slavery for a moral - the moral issue. I'm trying to... __EOS__ Ah, well. Property in yourself, owning yourself - having property rights in yourself is a moral issue, and this is one of Adam Smith's great points. Now, the living wage question is a difficult one. You see, we get into an interesting moral area here between the morality - what are called negative rights and positive rights.

Some people say they prefer that to the experience of reading a heavy, awkward print version of a book.__EOS__ It showed up in a  big box of children's books, all brightly colored, and many beautifully illustrated. But this one stood out. To begin with, this was a new  version of ""The Odyssey"" aimed at kids eight and up. But the artwork  seemed sophisticated  for a children's book. These were not your  standard depictions  of gods and goddesses with chiseled features in flowing gowns.__EOS__ We feel that the book is a nearly perfect technology as it is, and  that's just why it's been around for so long.__EOS__ Karen Lotz is president and publisher of Candlewick Press, which published  ""The Odyssey""  in this country. Candlewick  specializes in children's books, and like all publishing companies, now it releases books in both electronic and traditional book form.

There's guys through some of the sounds we've heard from the past.

So I feel like there's a lot elements of jungle and drum and bass, but it's got the halftime beat for the most part. So drum and bass and jungle's generally around, you know, 170 to 175 BPMs with...",2,,265," Yeah, we - I mean, I know I do, personally. Some of the stuff that I say on ""License to Ill,"" I say some real dumb stuff. And so, you know, I like the song, and the song's important to, you know, people that like us or listen to us. And so it's important. And so if that's what people want, you know, we should - you know, why not play the songs? But definitely, there's some things I don't like to say. __EOS__ Can you give us an example of something you've changed? __EOS__ I can't think of anything off the top of my head but just some dumb things about, like - I don't even know. __EOS__ It's usually the more sexist ones.

I have to say, I thought they were awfully good and... __EOS__ Well, the breakfast sandwiches were selling extremely well, but at the time, there was an aroma in the stores that I felt was kind of diluting the integrity of the coffee romance and the aroma of coffee. So we took the breakfast sandwiches out... __EOS__ You're talking what? You're talking bacon, cheese or something? ",0,,268," All right. We're talking with Antonio Damasio, author of ""Self Comes to Mind  Deconstructing the Conscious Brain,"" on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. __EOS__ I would spend the rest of my life inside the brainstem, not necessarily of humans... __EOS__ Hmm. __EOS__ ...but even of other species, to look at the very interesting way in which that fusion of body and brain does take place. ",0,,269," Such a great question. I was the first person to ever write about Alzheimer's disease from a first-person point of view. It was in a piece in the New York Times magazine in 1983, and I was in my 20s.  __EOS__ Bombshell.  __EOS__ Yeah, right. Oh, what a day that was. And realizing America's appetite for sex, which is good and healthy, I thought  Hmm, this seems like something that could take this book off in a different direction than my responsibility, which was to talk about a family struggle with a disease that arguably, as I said, was going to be the greatest health care crisis of the 20th and 21st centuries.  __EOS__ What goes in, what stays out.

They are very much alive and they are outlaws, having adopted the prenom de gaer, Jesse and Frank while retaining our illustrious surname which they drag through the mud at every criminal outing. __EOS__ Now, I don't want to give too much of the plot away here, but eventually Henry James gets dragged into the infamous and botched heist at the First National Bank in Northfield, Minnesota. Now that heist really happened in 1876 and you describe it accurately. __EOS__ Pretty accurately. Henry was not there as far as I know. ",0,,272," Well, thank you.__EOS__ So why did you choose the rapture as a point of departure for the novel?__EOS__ You know, I had been thinking a lot about evangelical Christianity in relation to my last book, ""The Abstinence Teacher."" It was a kind of exploration of the American culture war that was going on during the administration of George W. Bush. And I started thinking a lot about the rapture, and especially the idea - the tribulation, the seven-year period after the rapture, when the people who are left behind have to sort of - they get a second chance to get it right and fight on the side of good. And it struck me that the way that our culture works now, seven years is an incredibly long time. And in my mind, I thought, you know, some people three years in won't even remember the rapture; they'll just be on to the next thing. This, you know, apocalyptic event will be absorbed into the narrative of history the way that all kinds of other, you know, hugely traumatic historical events got absorbed in the flow of history.__EOS__ Actually, there are a lot of rapture deniers in the novel, or people who just think it's some other kind of phenomenon. There's a whole range of descriptions for it, right?",0,,273," No. Yeah. No, but the tone of it is very much like a ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" I mean it's really about two guys protecting their values and their right to land, you know. It's a pure slice of Americana in a fun way. __EOS__ OK. Well, come back and talk to us about that. __EOS__ I will. __EOS__ All right. Larysa Kondracki is the director of ""The Whistleblower,"" which is based on the real life story of Kathryn Bolkovac.

Were there Muslims on the panel, or was it just Christians?__EOS__ Oh, no. They were all Christians or lapsed Christians.__EOS__ So there were several Catholic priests. There were a couple of relatively pious Protestants, and then there was one flagrant atheist, a man named John Allegro, who had been brought up Methodist, I think, in England, and had kicked all that over, and he kind of became the bad boy who was trying to stir things up.",0,,275," But I mean, this album is so authentic that it's almost sort of an irony that you've taken that name for your band. __EOS__ Well, I remember that other story I read when I was a kid called ""The Scarlet Letter."" I thought about it in that way, you know, when you're -if you wear that name on your chest then it'll help you not to make those bad mistakes, you know, kind of like that. __EOS__ We're talking with Simon Felice and Robert Burke. The musicians perform as the Duke and the King. __EOS__ When I was a kid, I wanted to be a Marine. My grandpa was in the Marines. And I had a friend who did go into the Marines, and he fought in Iraq and he came back really hurt. And he was over there doing what he thought was right. And I wrote this about him, and thinking back to the time when we were all kids and sort of listening to the boombox and first realizing that sort of music was our religion. And I just hope and pray that our country some day figures out a way to not have to send our boys over there. ",2,,276," But I mean a lot of people listening to this are wondering - to restate the obvious - he confessed. I mean why would someone who wasn't guilty of a string of murders confess? __EOS__ There are, I believe, many more false confessions to murders than true confessions. In fact, if I could freelance for just a second, I would be in favor of laws strictly limiting what can be described as a confession in a court room. Because what happens in too many cases is the police know how to get somebody to confess to something. They know how to make that happen and they will make it happen, and they get a sort of half confession which they -the prosecutor then describes relentlessly as a confession when in reality it was just something like, yeah, I guess she must be dead by now. __EOS__ Sam Sheppard, Dr. Sam Sheppard, famous 1954 Cleveland murder case; a doctor accused of murdering his wife, Marilyn, famously the inspiration for ""The Fugitive"" TV series and movie. __EOS__ The Supreme Court agreed. The Supreme Court used the Sheppard case to say that the courts had a responsibility to make the case stand free of flying journalistic debris. It's extremely damaging to a fair trial to have people reaching judgment about the case in the newspapers and on the radios, before the facts are heard in a case.

He's worked with some of the biggest names in the industry. And yet, all the while in the back of his mind, he actually wanted to make a record that sounded like this... __EOS__ I'm not joking. Danger Mouse isn't just a fan of old spaghetti Westerns like ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly,"" he's obsessed with the music; music composed by the likes of Ennio Morricone. And so five years ago, he teamed up with the acclaimed Italian composer Daniele Luppi to basically make spaghetti Western music.

What about ""Bones"" - the show ""Bones,"" which is based on your books, and ""CSI"" - you know, do you feel like there's so much criminal science that goes on in these cases that - and that's how they're solved, you know, is by - does it give people a misleading idea of how a lot of these murders really are solved? __EOS__ Yeah. And not just murders. I mean, it's called the CSI effect. I just addressed the American Bar Association on this topic. The idea that jurors have way, way too high an expectation of science that you're going to find that one scrap of skin in an acre of corn or something and that's going to crack the case. And not only that, but I think there's also the CSI effects, if we want to call it that, impacts - I was just involved in the Casey Anthony case - and I think that also involves attorneys as well as expert witnesses in that expecting too much of science and pushing science way too far to the margins of where they should be presenting it in court. __EOS__ What were you doing with the Casey Anthony case? __EOS__ Well, I was the official forensic anthropologist on the defense team. I was reluctant, initially, but I watched some of the media develop, and I was offended by how some of the media convicted this woman prior to her day in court. And that's not how our system is supposed to work. You're supposed to be convicted in court in front of a jury of your peers. So I did agree to - I did a full examination of the skeleton and visited the scene where the body was discovered. ",0,,280,"  I appreciate that you've come on to address this.

We'll call Mr. Mfume and hopefully we'll be able to      get both of you on to talk about some of the issues in a better way than      we've been able to do since we were dealing with headlines today, and if      you'll accept that, we'll start to... __EOS__  Absolutely. __EOS__  ...put that in motion. __EOS__  All righty, buddy.

This is a place, it's a beautiful place. We have the greatest facilities for conventions. That's the way we make our living here. We have all the amenities necessary for serious important business to be conducted here.

You've got to have - just like starting with a pair of jacks are better to open in poker. ",2,,283," Thank you. __EOS__ And could - sir, could this have happened a can of pork and beans meant for human consumption? __EOS__ Well, there are situations where there are accidental contaminations of food ingredients intended for humans that occur around the world. One very good example that is kind of near and dear to the State of Michigan is a few decades ago where a fire retardant was accidentally incorporated into animal feed and ended up in PBB contamination of cow's milk that was consumed by essentially all citizens in Michigan back in the late '60s.

But I find it interesting - is all I can say - is I find it interesting that Olivia gets people - go after her, sometimes, on these sites because she's beautiful - I think is part of it.__EOS__ That's amazing, good for you. But because she is very beautiful, people are like  That's - you're using that.__EOS__ Tina Fey will be back in the second half of the show. Her new memoir is called ""Bossypants."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Tina Fey, the creator and star of the comedy series ""30 Rock."" She started her TV career as a writer on ""Saturday Night Live."" She went on to become the first woman to serve as the show's head writer, and she co-anchored ""Weekend Update."" After leaving the show, she returned to portray Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential campaign. Her new comic memoir is called ""Bossypants.""",0,,296," I think she decided it didn't matter. I think she decided that if she could strengthen herself and her own core and give of herself and take from experience what she needed, it did not matter whether she was married or not. Sounds crazy but that's what I think happened. I think she chose to stay with her own situation. __EOS__ What do you remember of your parents and their relationship with each other? __EOS__ It changed. I could tell you that he was emotionally distant or that he was open and joyful and lots of fun or that he was scary and domineering and it would all be true. He was I think much more distant than she was. I think he had a terrible time staying with any household. I think that's perhaps why there were so many, I don't know. I don't think he was comfortable in a normal family situation for any length of time. I think he had to keep leaving and that would have been difficult no matter what. But she used to tell us that the cure for loneliness is solitude. __EOS__ She so was lonely in her relationship and somehow being apart and alone helped her find her place. ",0,,297," So it would appear that it would be a breeding ground for absolutely nothing. But instead, it has built a very strange and amazing music community that has to work really hard to be able to exist. __EOS__ It's a scene that can be hard for outsiders to find. New Brunswick has a long tradition of DIY rock shows in the basements of houses near campus. __EOS__ This is the basement. Be really careful. __EOS__ Marissa Paternoster leads the way down the narrow stairs at Meat Town USA, one of the underground venues where Screaming Females got their start.

",1,,299," My guests are singer Merry Clayton and producer Lou Adler. Back in 1969, they recorded a series of Bob Dylan songs arranged as gospel numbers and they called the band the Brothers and Sisters. It's just been re-released. Merry, I think a lot of our listeners, like myself, you know, I got to know your incredible voice singing...__EOS__  ...rape, murder, it's just a shot away, away...__EOS__ ...Rape Murder, it's just a shot away, one of rock's most iconic songs. You know, the Rolling Stones ""Gimme Shelter."" I mean, that seems a long way from the gospel church scene in South Central.__EOS__ Well, I was born in New Orleans and my father was a Baptist minister. So what's in your soul and your spirit, whenever it needs to come out it will come up, you know. So for me to sing rape, murder is just a shot away called at 11 30 at night saying come to the studio and I'm pregnant and in pajamas, you know, I just went and rape, murdered it and went home, you know. I raped and I murdered it and then I was gone after about three or four takes. You know, that was it for me.",2,,300," We never really worried too much about, you know, the idea of Kips peers sort of moaning about the film or whatever. It was more about and it's something that I've apply to all my other films, is I  think the audience can feel whether there's a rule set behind what your doing and I think they can feel when you're becoming anarchic and just sort of abandoning and saying it's just a movie. So whether the audience understands the underlying principles or not it was very important to stick with that.__EOS__ You know what we haven't talked about at all yet is that is also, along with these huge cosmic story ideas, it's also a movie that's very much focused on family and on love. The lead character, Coop, who's played Matthew McConaughey leaves his children behind on earth to go to space and try to save the human race. Let's listen to a scene with his daughter, Murph, before he leaves.__EOS__  I'm coming back.__EOS__  When?",1,,301," Yeah, I think also Pete - the repertoire Pete had, those things started appearing in various schoolbooks for kids that grew up, you know, in the '50s and '60s and also summer camps. A lot of these summer camps in the Northeast, which a lot of the kids who went to those camps became sort of the folk singers that made records later on heard ""This Land Is Your Land"" a lot.__EOS__ Yeah, I think that's true.__EOS__ I went to camp, yeah. So let's talk about why you're both so interested in Woody Guthrie. Jeff, let's start with you. You've just put out this new centennial box set of Woody Guthrie recordings, with, you know, a book of essays, including an essay by you. What do you see as Woody Guthrie's importance in American music?__EOS__ You know, I was one of those kids who grew up, you know, in the '60s, hearing him - my parents playing him and stuff. And when I started working at the Smithsonian 25 years ago, I started working with his actual materials  his lyric sheets and the actual audio and digitizing it.",2,,302," That's probably one of the funnier scenes for us. It was challenging mostly because it's very hard not to laugh at Michael Keaton when he's doing a scene like that - like, I grew up on the guy. I used to watch his movies and copy his lines, and it's very, very difficult not to laugh when you're doing scene like that. But it was enormous fun. Probably the most nerve-racking thing about it was that it came after probably one of the longest shots in the movie - one of the longest sequences without any kind of a stitch in it - in the movie - and you get to this point where you have to throw a punch and hit it and have the camera angle be right. And you just think like, if we miss this, if we goof on - just on this one punch, technically we've just thrown away, you know, 12 minutes and four big scenes where actors might have done some really fantastic stuff. And you're going to lose it all to like messing up a stunt. And that was - that was a little anxiety inducing.__EOS__ So did you have to actually land punches on each other?__EOS__ Well, no - these guys are, you know....__EOS__ They were not good at this .",1,,303," And I imagine when you were writing that you were thinking that, you were giving like the children an opportunity to say that word for themselves, like puddle, he means puddle.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ Yes?__EOS__ Yes.",2,,304," Live at home, no, live at home, I should say. And let me just say as a viewer, there are too many commercials.__EOS__ You never knew that.__EOS__ Now that I'm on the other side. I never knew. Or I'd known as a child and then forgotten. But I felt like just this awful metamorphosis of no longer being on the show. And then in the following weeks, you know, a couple times I've been out of town, I've had to watch it Sunday morning, which is a lovely way to watch the show. The part you miss the most, not being on the show anymore, is Wednesday, which was the table read, where you basically get to watch 40 pieces, all with varying degrees of success. But I remember when people like Kristen Wiig left, or people like Andy Samberg left, the thing that I felt, you know, so lucky about was that I got to see everything they tried to do for a seven or eight-year period, like all their failures, all their successes. You got to see everything, like, in the incubator stage to the final product, and it's so - that part of the job is so wonderful.__EOS__ We're listening to an interview recorded earlier this year with Seth Meyers who hosts the Emmys tonight. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",3,,305," But you remember your experiences in Iraq and remember them well enough to have written the book?__EOS__ That's the really frustrating part. That's the, and that was part of what I was working through, is why can I remember the day of six VBIED so well but I can't remember, I can't remember my kids being born?__EOS__ You use the word crazy a lot in your memoir, describing how you feel crazy. And crazy is almost like a state of being. I mean, you're almost like personify, you know, it almost becomes a character in your book. And it's a funny word to use in a way because I think a lot of vets coming home, the last thing they want to be called or thought of as is crazy. Why did you want to use that term so much to describe how you were feeling?__EOS__ Well, one reason is the reason you just gave is because it did feel like something outside of me. But I know well the stereotype and I feel it myself. You just don't want to be the crazy veteran. You don't want to become a caricature of yourself. And that's what it felt like I was turning into, and I need a word. And if you're nauseous, you know you're about to throw up. And if you have a headache you know that that's called pain. And you probably know what stress is and worry is, but I had a physical symptom that I didn't have a name for. And I went to the emergency room a couple times 'cause I thought I had a heart attack, and it turns out I didn't. And they hooked me up to all the tests and stress test and everything else and when they eliminated every physical symptom or every physical potential, I was left with a feeling that still didn't have a name. And so, crazy was the best way that I could describe it.",3,,306," Well, I mean, it's the case that even as the college-going population has increased over time, the number of tradition nonprofit and public colleges and universities has pretty much stayed the same. America went through a great period of expansion of our higher education infrastructure in the middle of the 20th century, we built out a whole system of community colleges, we built big regional public universities, but that all pretty much came to a finish in the mid- to late 1970s.__EOS__ Now what about - are there more administrators than there used to be, deans, assistant deans, that kind of thing?__EOS__ Very much so. And that has been one of the interesting things that has come from studies of how colleges and universities spend their money. It turns out professors aren't really doing all that well. They're not the beneficiaries of the large increase in college spending that has gone on. In fact, the percentage of all students taught by non-tenure-track professors, adjuncts, teaching assistants, has gone up and up and up.__EOS__ Right and I know that when this interview airs, we're going to get emails from people who say you don't know what I do, we do important work in these positions. What are they doing? Do you feel like you know enough to safely say that this is unnecessary?",3,,307," Well, Secretary Herman, it's been a delight. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ Again, that was former Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman. And we've posted several online-only audio clips at our Web site, where you can hear Herman talk about her college days in New Orleans.

It's partially because I was suffocating. I was sinking down and had - there were two horses with no flesh - just muscle and bone colliding. I remember lots of colors as they merged into one another. That's the only way I can describe it. And I felt terrible pressure on my chest. The doctor was banging my chest so - I think everybody experiences these things in different ways. That was my recollection of what happened to me. I was very lucky.",2,,309," Mm-hmm. __EOS__ I like to walk up on a mountain on Easter and get a sense of rebirth. Some people jog. Some people meditate. You know, theres certain people who whip themselves on the back, there's - everybody has their own way of trying to see past the veil. And this is just the one that I happened to come up with. My metaphor is this, is that you dont need a huge tuning fork. We used to think - we used to have a tuning fork eight-foot long and weighed 2,000 pounds, just to find middle C. But now, all you need is a little, bitty tuning fork once a year, maybe. But no, I dont know anybody who really goes out and gets ripped anymore. __EOS__ At what point did you decide to give up the kind of Pranksters life? The story that Ive heard is the other Pranksters went to Woodstock. You didnt want to go. And when they came back, they came back to a sign hung in your driveway that just said  No. __EOS__ Well, there were 61 people when they headed out to Woodstock. And after they were gone, I went upstairs - and we live in a barn; we still live in the same barn. We fixed it up, and its a pretty nice place. But at that time, there was still hay in the loft of the barn. And I found out - one of these little hippie warrens, where they dug in with their ratty, old sleeping bags and their copy of Zap magazine. And stuck right down in a hay bale was a candle, which had burned right down to the hay before it had gone off. And I thought hey, enlightenment is one thing but being this loose is - I mean, my grandpa wouldn't have allowed them up there and my great grandpa wouldn't have, and there's certain things that take precedent over enlightenment. ",0,,310," Well, I think for me, the period of life right after college, there's kind of a grace period where being a mess is charming and interesting. And then I think when you hit around 27, it stops being charming and interesting, and it starts being kind of pathological. And you have to find a new way of life, otherwise, you're going to be in a place where the rest of your peers have been moving on, and you're stuck. But...__EOS__ But you've been making movies for several years. So I'm thinking, like, how bumpy could that ride have been for you?__EOS__ Well, I think that anybody who does anything in the arts feels very close to failure, because it seems like it's so possible to not be doing it, because even when things are going well, it feels like they're always about to fall apart and about to not work. And so I don't ever feel - it's not like I spent my 20s feeling like everything's going great, and aren't I successful.__EOS__ Can you just say a few words about what that was like? I think a lot of people go through that, thinking that their friends are their family, and their friends understand them better, or their friends understand things nd ttheir family, and they",1,,311," I thought you might say that. __EOS__ I hate it. You know what? I've seen film - and one particular comes to mind, a guy jumps off of a 250 foot dam and hits the water and they cut to the water and he bobs up like he's a duck or something, you know, and you go wait a minute. Give me a break. A guy would kill himself doing that. There's no way you could do that. And they - and just with cars and motorcycles and all kinds of things. And to me it takes all the reality out of the show. I just can't stand it. Because I grew up and even as a director, we never used that stuff. We did it for real. __EOS__ OK. Well, one more thing, it's still easy to see your work on television, because a lot of your western TV shows are being rerun, western movies are sometimes on TV, your movies with Burt Reynolds. So when you turn on the TV and one of your films or TV shows is on and there you are risking your life doing a stunt, what goes through your mind? __EOS__ I got a residual coming. ",1,,312," We try to introduce new listeners to songs and artists that we think we might be undeservedly neglected. I mean, for example, this year we have two songs by Bob Dorough, who I'm comfortable claiming is the great neglected American jazz superstar. Once you sort of crack his code, you become addicted. I mean, he's sort of hard to get used to, but once you get used to him, you can't get enough. __EOS__ Marc Smirnoff of The Oxford American magazine. The annual music issue is out on newsstands now. Marc, thanks again. __EOS__ Thank you, Alex. __EOS__  If you crawl from some hole in the wall in Nepal, I will follow. Just to give in to 'ya, I'd go to India, too... ",3,,313," That first song, ""Outta Sight,"" sounds pretty '60s. Is that what you're going for?__EOS__ Well, I love classic rock, good old-fashioned pop with strong melodies and all that jazz. So, in that sense, yeah, I suppose that is what I'm going for. In this case, making the album. We just did it all in one room and I guess that's quite an old-school way of approaching making a record. So, maybe that does come across a little bit.__EOS__ Why one room as opposed to - and you know how these things can be done nowadays. I mean, the guys playing bass can be in Australia just contributing tracks online. Why was it important for everyone to be in one room?__EOS__ I think you get a certain live energy when you can, you know, look your drummer in your face or you can glance over at your guitarist and give him a wink or you can even take the song in a bit of a more jammy direction 'cause you can take it as it comes versus contriving it and structuring it in a rigid way. So, it gave us a kind of freedom.",2,,314," We're talking with Michael Kimmel, a professor at State University of New York at Stony Brook, and with Kay Hymowitz about the subject of what it means to be a man today. And we're talking here on TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. __EOS__ Hi. I'm great. Thanks for taking my call. I love NPR. __EOS__ Great. __EOS__ My comment was actually more or less a question. I'm 23 years old, and I'm constantly going out to concerts and, you know, going to social events and everything. And I feel like I'm always running into guys my age who are completely immature. And it's really frustrating for a woman my age, who - got my own apartment, my own career, going to college. And well, my question is, is how do we find these guys our age that are men?

Now, you've said that you think most comics are filled with self-loathing. Does that describe how you felt about yourself when you were young?__EOS__ No. No, I didn't - I've always had a pretty healthy self-esteem, you know? I mean, I think we're - I'm sure I'm riddled with insecurity as well. But I've got a pretty - I like myself. I've got a pretty good self-esteem. I think, like, my comedy came more from humiliation and from - I was a chronic bedwetter. You know, I had this deep dark secret. You know, if I had to go to sleepover parties I would, like, just pinch myself awake all night.__EOS__ .__EOS__ Thank God.",3,,317," It is surprising. I don't know. Maybe he was also looking to be generous. But the Madison correspondence is dry. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ It reads like an insurance policy. And Madison didn't appeal to Jefferson in a personal sense, in the way  I mean to Adams in the way that Jefferson did. __EOS__ Yeah. Jefferson and Madison had quite the relationship. ",0,,318,"  No, are you cussing with me? __EOS__  Don't cuss and point at me. __EOS__  You're going to cuss with someone, you're not going to cuss with me, you little cuss. __EOS__  Just buy the tree. ",1,,319," I think so, yeah. I think that's becoming a bit more abstract because you are just a bit more self-conscious.__EOS__ Because people are parsing your lyrics more now and sort of reading them more carefully?__EOS__ Yeah, that's probably it. It's something I'd like to try and work against, to be honest, on the next record. I think it's nice to just be unashamed and just - that definitely appeal to a lot of people anyway in the beginning.__EOS__ On this record, Jack, I hear a lot of really powerful influences, particularly British influences  Stone Roses from the late '80s, early '90s, Roni Size and the drum and bass sound. And this song, ""Still,"" has an unmistakable Radiohead quality to it.",2,,320," It was a great time. I mean, that was my introduction to chicken on skewers, finger food. You know, I look back very fondly.__EOS__ Little egg rolls?__EOS__ Yes. Oh, God.__EOS__ So how did that shape your sense of what it meant to be black?",3,,321," So it seems to me that, as just an audience member, that what might be the most uncomfortable moment at the Oscar ceremony is when the camera's on you and your name is announced as a nominee and then - you know, you have to smile and look like - yes, I'm, you know, so happy to be here. Which you probably are. And then sometimes the camera goes onto one of the losers as the winner's name is being announced.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ And the look of, like, anger or disappointment or frustration is sometimes really painful to watch. So have you, like, been planning what to do or what not to do if you lose and the camera...__EOS__ Well, I've had a lot of practice.",1,,322," Well, Anna McGarrigle, it's really been a pleasure to talk with you.

",2,,323," You started ""7 Up"" long before reality television.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ And now in the area of reality television, many of the people in those shows are there because they have outsize personalities. They're willing to do things that are ridiculous or shameless even, and are willing to be ridiculed because that's how a lot of people watch reality TV, to ridicule the people who are in it. Do you find ever that people are watching your ""Up"" series in the spirit of reality TV, which is not the spirit that the movies are intended to be in?__EOS__ I honestly don't think so. I mean, it was a big issue for us, especially when we did ""49 Up,"" because reality television has really got a grip of - in British television. So my participants are saying are we another cheesy reality show? And if so, why are we being paid tons of money like ""American Idol""? And I had to try to explain what I perceived was the difference between a reality and the documentary.",3,,324," But this has to be very old school, you know? It's all got to be there. __EOS__  There's riverboat casinos and you still have yet to see a soul.

It just bothered Mr. Stoneham, which was the owner of that club. And plus, he didn't, you know, he couldn't pay the players because he wasn't making any money. So that's one of the reasons I think he left. You know? __EOS__ When the Giants last home game in New York ended, a 12-year-old fan was part of the crowd on the field, chanting for Mays to come out of the clubhouse. __EOS__ Willie did come out, and I started to cry, sitting at the bottom step. And he waved to the crowd. And then, in my distant memory, I remember him looking down the stairs, right at me. And with tears rolling down my face, I remember him saying, hi, kid. Goodbye, kid. __EOS__ Years later, Lanny Davis became a Washington lawyer and Bill Clinton defender, and he met Mays who told him he has no recollection of that whatever. Lanny's love for his idol is undiminished. ",3,,326," Well, gentlemen, it's always a pleasure talking with you.

It was certainly a danger. But, again, as they keep on telling me, no one dies from the arm. You know, so there's a lot of stuff you can do with one arm, you know, like continue living. __EOS__ Absolutely, and that's great news. So now you need to do a reading from the book. __EOS__ Okay. __EOS__ And I want you to read from Page 212, and this is after you you've gotten, you know, mixed diagnoses in a period of time since the tumor was diagnosed. So first you were told that they had to take the arm, and then you were told that they didn't. So where does this reading come in? What were you told? ",3,,329," ...and checks themselves out, and they know what they're going to see. We don't know. There's a certain moment where you just are terrified about what you're going to see. So you - if you are forced to look in a mirror, you kind of squint, and then gently open your eyes to see if it's safe. And if it's not, you just close them and walk on.__EOS__ You've had a great career as a screenwriter and as a director. And I wanted to talk to you about one of my favorite movies of yours, and this is ""My Blue Heaven,"" which my family has been watching and re-watching for years and years.__EOS__  We are not accusing you of anything but speeding at the moment, Mr. Wilkinson, but I would like very much to know about the items in your trunk.__EOS__  Which items?",1,,330," And I put it away after high school for a while and came back to it late in life and started playing around with a friend, Tyler Volk, who's a professor of biology at NYU. And we always joked about having a band. And then one day, we decided we'd put together a band to play Christmas parties. __EOS__ Yeah, right. Two for one. __EOS__ That was it. So we put together a band, and Daniela Schiller and Nina Curley joined us, and we went out to Brooklyn, and that was the birth of The Amygdaloids. __EOS__ And the name Amygdaloids? Why that?

What I love about you guys is, you don't really take yourselves too seriously. You seem to be poking fun at yourselves for not being able to live up to the hype that's around you. __EOS__ I mean, am I reading too much into this here? ",2,,332," So there isn't a whole lot that's known about it. Do you have an estimated lifespan for him? Do you think he'll live to, like, an average life expectancy, or is that not expected? __EOS__ No. There are a couple of CFC people who have lived to middle age. That was the - when I used to ask doctors, you know, I was trying to figure out what it was, and we first diagnosed it when he was about two. They would - doctors would say, well, you know, he could live to middle age. And I just remember thinking, you know, is that a good thing, or is that a bad thing? Because middle age, great. But middle age, in that much pain, not so great. __EOS__ So do you worry, like, what would happen if he outlived you? __EOS__ Yes, of course. Every parent of the disabled, you spend most of your time planning, putting money aside if you can or, you know, how do you save it? What should you put it in?

He was playing French horn and keyboards      and observing a tense encounter with the Stones' great drummers, Charlie      Watts. __EOS__  Well, the producer, who was Jimmy Miller, was trying to show      Charlie Watts how to play something.  And first, he explained it to      Charlie, but Charlie couldn't play it.  So Jimmy said, `Can I sit at the      drums and I'll play it for you and then you'll be able to do it?'  So he      sat down and he played it, and Charlie said, `Why don't you just play      it?' and walked away.  And I said, `Oh, that's not good.'  So Charlie      Watts didn't play on that track. __EOS__  The producer ended up playing? ",2,,334," Yeah. Absolutely. It's about more than survival. It's also about  Can you participate in social conversations? Are you ashamed to be seen in public or not? And, of course, there's some controversy as to whether that sort of thing should count for the poverty line or not.__EOS__ What role does inequality play as we're looking at things like poverty and the state of a country's economy?__EOS__ Well, poverty and inequality are connected. Income inequality is just some kind of measure of the gap between the rich and the poor. And it's very contested because there were just so many different ways to think about it. Are you comparing the very richest to the very poorest? Are you looking at the assets that people have? Or are you just looking at their income? What we can be reasonably confident of saying is that inequality has been rising.__EOS__ And what is the damage - if any - that can be done to a country and its economy when there is a lot of inequality?",0,,335," ...this viral video that went out? __EOS__ Yes, absolutely. There was a swimming pool that must have had a thousand people in it. And you couldn't even see the water, there were so... __EOS__ That was in Tokyo. It was great. It's just a wave pool. And all you see are the people. I mean, you'd have a hard time, you know, getting your finger wet in that pool. __EOS__ Absolutely true. Let's take another call. This is Desmond from Birmingham, Alabama. Desmond, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. ",0,,336,"  Right.  Right. __EOS__  And what were you saying back to them, if anything? __EOS__  Nothing.  Nothing.  I was in shock.  And then they had us lined      up against the wall and they said, `Put your head up against the wall.'      And we're still handcuffed.  And my head was about two, three inches from      the wall and the guard took my head and he said, `I said, put your F'ing      head up against the wall.'  And he grabbed my head and he just smashed it      into the cinder block.  After that, he told my cameraman, `Take your      F'ing clothes off.'  And so he strips in front of--right there in the      lobby in front of everyone.  And then they take me in the back and they      tell me that, `You can't stay here because you're an American citizen.' __EOS__  From their perspective, they're dealing with an entrenched      insurgency with improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, going off daily,      killing people almost every day.  Do you understand at all the way that      they were behaving? ",3,,337," Yeah. A lot of the music on this record was written years ago. For me, that's just the process, you write it when it comes, you used when it's needed.__EOS__ After Oberlin, you went to China for seven years.__EOS__ Yes, just about, yeah.__EOS__ Well, that's a long time. Why?",2,,338,"  What is the formula for compensation, sir? __EOS__  How about $10,000 in cash? __EOS__  Do I  well, let's just break that down. __EOS__  No. No wait. Wait, now wait a minute. ",1,,339," People focus on the barriers - what would've been gender barriers in my career. I grew up in a country where I was African-American. My first negative initiation to being black was in kindergarten when kids started to call me the N-word on the playground. I didn't know what it was about; I just knew it was bad. And I'm running home crying. And my father's like, you've got to toughen up. This is the country you live in. You have a series of things that happen to you growing up that people who are in the majority don't experience. They don't experience driving across country as a family and not being able to get a hotel and sleeping in the car.__EOS__ That happened to your family?__EOS__ This is the '60s. People are marching in the street, Martin Luther King. People are being water-hosed for the right to vote. And my dad making us sit at a table in a restaurant as we're driving across country because we can't get service, and we're going to sit there for hours to prove a point. We didn't get served, but we made our point. And it's interesting. It gives you an awareness of politics at a very young age.__EOS__ She was only 12 when she decided she wanted to join the Navy.

Sam Cooke took into soul music, which he practically invented himself, the sound and the harmonies of The Soul Stirrers. And the guitars, Roy Crain, who was one of the few participants on this packet still living, invented some of those harmonies and some of those grooves. The lead singer, Paul Foster, who was Sam Cooke's co-lead - in fact Paul had been in the group before Sam joined it. __EOS__ So Sam Cooke actually moved the sacred style into a more secular arena? __EOS__ Absolutely. __EOS__ Yeah. I have to talk about another performer, a woman, if we're going to talk about sacred and secular - Sister Rosetta Tharpe. It looks like she's on a TV show that seems to be a gospel music showcase. What can you tell us about that? ",2,,342," Well, I think, Nell Painter, she's almost certainly right about that. __EOS__ I think that's true. Last semester, I had a class with people who had not grown up in the United States. And they said pretty much what Patricia said, that they were absolutely shocked by Americans' preoccupation with categorizing people by race. __EOS__ Indeed, there's a lot of interesting material about the odalisques and the entire tradition of Circassian or Georgian beauty in, indeed, harem slavery that contributed so much to this. And indeed, one of the great things I found in your book was the idea that these white marble statues were the ideal of female beauty, and indeed male beauty. __EOS__ Male beauty, yeah. ",0,,343," But what about like, certain - just - like, vocal flourishes, like the - excuse me for embarrassing myself here - like the ri-i-i-se again thing.__EOS__ Oh, that.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ That was just me showing off.

And you are more theatrical than he is and more into, like, clothing and shopping and, you know, joking and everything. So how did you figure out how to play your role so that it wouldn't kind of cross the line into stereotype?__EOS__ Yeah, yeah, it's tricky because you don't - I certainly didn't want to be gay clown on this, you know, because the subject matter is actually a really sweet one and I think a really lovely one about these people who are so in love and so committed to each other that they realize that what's missing in their life is to share that love with a child.__EOS__ So I don't know much about Justin Bartha, but I read someplace that he's straight. Does that matter?__EOS__ He is straight. You know, at first I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure if it was going to matter. I'm gay, so I felt like, you know, there's a - you know, I enjoyed the fact that I, you know, being a homosexual got to play a homosexual, and so often you see, you know, straight actors playing gay actors, and people talk about how brave they are to play, you know, homosexuals.

That it's such, like, you know, they're doing something so, you know, revelatory.",3,,345," Do you expect the people in the ""Up"" series to keep you updated as to where they are so you can find them every seven years? And I'm thinking especially here of Neil, who is somebody who seems to have struggled most of his life with depression and...__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ ...like really serious depression, and maybe other issues as well. And there was a period - an extended period where he was homeless. And I don't - I don't know how you track down somebody like Neil when they're in that part of their life.__EOS__ We did lose track of Neil a bit at 28. And so we did have to try and, you know, get through some piece of bureaucracy to find him. He's always been very willing to do it and he's incredibly articulate, as you know if you've seen them.",3,,346," Did you grow up with white and African-American friends?__EOS__ The school I went to was probably, far more predominantly, white Jewish kids. I went to private schools in Los Angeles and I was the only mixed kid in my class. I think I assimilated pretty well, but I - I did OK but, you know, I got teased for my hair.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ I remember a kid, you know, pointing at my hair at a pool party, saying  Go under the water again. Then I did and he said  Your hair is like a sponge. And I'm still mad at him. And I'm almost 40.",3,,347," I always say to Gustavo, you know, you saved my life, man. Thank you so much, because I was completely lost. I sent my demos to different record companies and Gustavo, he was the one that really understood what I was doing because he's also between rock and folk. He's an amazing musician. __EOS__ Gustavo Santaolalla is one of the most successful producers of Latin alternative, working with such groups as Cafe Tacuba and Molotov. He also composed the Oscar-winning soundtracks to ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Babel."" Santaolalla returns Juanes' compliment from his recording studio in L.A. __EOS__ He's an incredible songwriter. He's an extraordinary guitar player. He has a wonderful voice, you know? He's a fairly good-looking guy, I would say.

I don't know what that is. I suppose it's some peculiar thing I'm able to do. I don't know. It's certainly nothing I work at or particularly aware of in the process.

At this point, I'm incredibly grateful for the relationship that it's given me with the men that I play music with. It's a great journey, and I'm really grateful for that. And also, being able to scream at the top of my lungs in front of people is very therapeutic. __EOS__ When you're on stage? ",2,,353," Oh, absolutely. He made a vow and an oath to his country, and he didn't disclose anything that he shouldn't have. You know, as I said earlier, I had this desire to sort of crack him open, but that was much more centered around what employment with the agency had done to him as a human being.__EOS__ Do you mean the kind of extreme compartmentalization of a life?__EOS__ Yeah, and also a certain kind of control, or self-control. And it was the way that those things manifested in our life that I wanted to understand. You know, I wanted to just feel like I was dealing with the real man. In the course of writing the book, I really do feel like I came to a much better understanding of that and I abandoned this idea that I was going to somehow, you know, completely unveil my father. And I realized that was a misguided wish in the first place.__EOS__ Scott Johnson. His new book is called ""The Wolf and the Watchman  A Father, a Son and the CIA.""

As a younger veteran, I just did a four year enlistment with the air force and I came back through Bangor in 2007. And I was greeted by these older veterans. And I thought it was just such an honor, for them to thank me, for what I did. __EOS__ Its interesting, you cant watch this film as an outsider and not see the faces of the older vets and look at the, well, the kids as what they, a lot of them coming off the plane and think, gee, what are they be going to be doing in 45 or 50 years. ",1,,356," Since then, ""La Forza"" has become a standard at the top opera houses around the world - this despite the belief among some old school opera singers that this opera is cursed.__EOS__ I heard. I heard many stories from old singers, from old conductor, from old directors.__EOS__ That's the Italian tenor Marcello Giordani. ""La Forza's"" very first performance was delayed nine months when its soprano came down with a horrible illness. Theaters have inexplicably lost power during performances. The great Franco Correlli, he would protect himself while singing the role of Alvaro. Some say he held a cross. Others say he held a very personal part of his anatomy. It's believed that the late Luciano Pavarotti wouldn't even touch the role of Alvaro. And at The Metropolitan Opera in New York where we reached Marcello Giordani...__EOS__ Something happened on stage years ago here at The Met.",2,,357," I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Coming up tomorrow twitter turns five. We'll talk about how that social media tool is having an effect on politics and culture not just in the U.S. but around the world. That conversation is coming up but we want to begin today with news about the very important relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan. The head of Pakistan's powerful spy agency known as ISI is in Washington today to meet with U.S. officials.  __EOS__ Thank you Michel.  __EOS__ So, Julie why did the Americans cut off this aid to Pakistan and why now?  __EOS__ Well, the Americans have been frustrated for some time and they are angry at what they consider to be deceit and slow action in hunting down the militants the U.S. wants Pakistan to go after. Pakistan has been unwilling to hunt militants friendly to the Afghan Taliban. They use Pakistan's tribal areas as a safe haven to launch operations in Afghanistan that kill NATO troops so, of course the United States wants Pakistan to go after them and the United States has been hammering away on this but doesn't have a whole lot to show for it.  ",3,,358," Well, the first is, which we still have, we have three small kids, so like the older ones they're kind of taken care of. But the younger one, every night at some point he stands in front of our bed and you feel sorry for them. They're sweet and small and they just cuddle onto you and you think, you know, how could anybody have any problem with that? And they start snoring quietly. Everybody goes back to sleep. But then in the next image you see how a child slowly starts rotating. __EOS__ We like to call it the helicopter mode. And then like half an hour later, you wake up with a foot kind of punched into your jaw and then you try to turn them back and then they kind of keep rotating. And at some point you realize it's five in the morning and you haven't really slept for the last three hours. __EOS__ So in your series about the difficulty of actually sleeping, you do battle with a mosquito. And then you write  The opposite of a mosquito is spooning  mosquitoes are awful, whereas spooning is super. The one thing I haven't really figured out is where the person in the back is supposed to put that bottom arm. __EOS__ You want to describe the illustration? ",3,,359," If you're just joining us, I'm speaking with members of The Blind Boys of Alabama about their music and their new album, ""Down in New Orleans."" __EOS__ Well, that's lovely. __EOS__ The world is not what we would like for it to be. That's why the song says make a better world. Let's strive to fix the world as best we can. __EOS__ I'm curious, though, about why you decided to do ""Down in New Orleans."" Was it that you wanted to call attention to the situation down there after Katrina, or is it just you just love the music, or... ",2,,360,"  And then if you're lucky enough, you do reach the status where      you are, you're selling out theaters, you're talking to a completely      different audience.  When you look at the idea that you've done      television, that you're doing movies, we you see the pressure recently,      based on headlines about Dave Chappelle and how--whatever the case is      with Dave right now, I think most agree a lot of pressure when you start      to climb a ladder.  Do you ever concern yourself about that? __EOS__  I try to stay grounded and just remember why I got into this      business, why I started doing stand-up.  You know, my goal is, I want to      be a really good stand-up comic.  That's still my journey.  I'm still on      that, you know.  So--and everything else--I mean, it's pressure when,      like you said, the people show up in the theaters and you sell them out,      because they are there to see you.  I mean, my crowd is very diverse,      and, you know, I know these people.  They work hard, and for someone to      put their money up, you know, slap down whatever, 30, 40 bucks to come      out to see you, you want to give them a good show. __EOS__  What has been--over the course of your ascension, what has been      the most fun for you? __EOS__  Ed, you said that like I didn't know what ascension meant.      `Your ascension.' ",3,,361," All right, Brad. Thank you. __EOS__ Well, absolutely. My friends, man, are part of the reason why who I am today, still to today. You know, and like I said before, they never let me -they never let me get big headed even if I wanted to. I never wanted to, but even if I tried to they would always keep me grounded, you know? It's just the friendship that we had. We never felt like we were bigger than anybody else. __EOS__ LeBron James and Buzz Bissinger write about - LeBron James and the man he calls his brother in a book called ""Shooting Stars."" And LeBron James was with us today from our bureau in New York. __EOS__ Oh, thank you very much for having me.

And one of the things they do is make art about bombs. __EOS__ Right. And there was that - I mean, I think that case was - there was - I think there was a chapter They Did It for Art, and he decided he wanted - you know, we live in a violent world. He wanted to make, you know, art with TNT. And, you know, some people, just - that's their choice. And, you know, it is dangerous and it could go off and that's why the squad was called. __EOS__ Hmm. Interesting book. Thanks very much for being with us. Ted Gerstein. __EOS__ Thank you. ",0,,363," Two words, the Revolutionary Guard. What we have been seeing in the last decade is a gradual militarization of Iranian politics, thanks to the rise of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. The Revolutionary Guard, of course, is this military intelligence security apparatus that runs most of the levers of government in Iran and is now in control of about a third of Iran's annual budget and, as I mentioned, almost all of the black market. __EOS__ If Iran is, in fact, controlled by the Revolutionary Guard, I mean, what can this sort of a popular movement actually do to break that hold on power? __EOS__ If Iran descends into a full-scale military dictatorship, that is something that this population simply will not stand for. You're talking about a population that 70 percent under the age of 30, in which the literacy rate for women alone is 90 percent, a population that is politically sophisticated, technologically savvy, as we've seen, one that will not put up with a full-scale military dictatorship. __EOS__ Well, it sounds like your policy prescription, Reza Aslan, is not for the U.S. to engage the Ahmadinejad government diplomatically, but to simply wait them out. ",3,,364," I remember being very angry as a child and as an adult at Aslan. I always felt that here is a world that had a, you know, a proper god in it, a god who you could see, who would come down and change the course of events, but he didn't do it very much, and he would often let battles go on and events really spin out of control, and people would die before Aslan would step in. Why would a God not help people in every possible way that he could? __EOS__ So in ""The Magicians,"" Quentin and his colleagues confront the god of Fillory, a ram named Ember, demanding to know why he let his people suffer. __EOS__ There's a strong tradition in the 20th century that is against storytelling. It is against plot. I wanted to move past that. I wanted to write something that was pure pleasure and pure storytelling. And I felt that in doing so, you didn't have to give up the kind of beautiful, lyrical, self-aware literary language that we associate with literary novels. __EOS__ Lev Grossman says now he's writing a sequel to ""The Magicians."" He says magic is a perfect metaphor for the power of language, that words can cast a spell and change the universe. ",0,,365," Yeah, that's a long train ride. No. The most challenging part about this for me was going home and not having more scenes to do. You know, you get in this environment with these talented artists and the process of creating magic begins and you don't want to let it go. So, that was the biggest challenge for me is just, oh man, we're finished? I want to do some more. __EOS__ It's an amazing cast, and I have to ask how did you get Mr. American Gigolo, Richard Gere, to play a tired, sour, worn-out old cop? __EOS__ Richard Gere is the perfect face for this movie. You know, he is the perfect face, he is the charming man who on the outside appears to have it all together; internally he's empty and he's lost and his conscience has been turned off. And there's a rebirth in him. __EOS__ Here's the deal  our commissioner, he believes in this new program that puts rookie cops in the highest crime areas, so they want seasoned hair bags like you breaking these recruits in. Since you're the oldest here... ",1,,366," And The Notorious B.I.G., or Biggie, reinterprets ""La Di Da Di"" on his number one hit called ""Hypnotize."" So if we come all the way out to the present day now, the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus, she reinterprets ""La Di Da Di"" completely for her generation. And we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part and then see how she sort of flipped it.__EOS__  La di da di, we like to party. We don't cause trouble. We don't bother nobody.__EOS__  La da di da di, we like to party__EOS__  La di da da di. We like to party.",2,,367," So, you had a big weekend, yeah.__EOS__ From playing the weekend, yeah.__EOS__ Let me ask you both about another cut here, which is an unusual - I don't know if we'd call it a love song.

This is the story of a gigolo.",1,,368," Oh, I don't -__EOS__ Your boys? __EOS__ I don't really know. I mean they love me. You know, they know I'm clowning around. So - my one son is 18.

I try to go home at least four times a year. But being in school and having a job, it's difficult. But I do try to make it home.__EOS__ Hmm. Well, Matthew, thank you very much for the call. Appreciate it.__EOS__ Mm-hmm. Bye-bye.",1,,371," I mean it's a part of, that's the life.

At the time that I wrote ""House,"" in the - around the end of the '70s and the early '80s, I was reading Chicano literature written by men. And a lot of the literature that was coming to me was written by people in the Southwest.__EOS__ Also with us from the studios of KSTX in San Antonio is David Rice, a Chicano writer and filmmaker based in Austin. He's the author of ""Give the Pig a Chance"" and ""Crazy Loco.""",0,,373,"  You know, it's interesting, Marsha, is when we talk about huge      smash, you guys have such a dedicated following, and when I say huge      smash, I don't mean in sheer numbers and sales.  Obviously, someone like      Britney Spears and others are going to sell far more albums, but you have      found such a dedicated following to your sound and such a connection with      your fans, I think that in the long run, that may prove to be, you know,      more satisfying and beneficial--maybe not to the pocketbook... __EOS__  Right. __EOS__  ...but to the artist's side of who you are. __EOS__  I think for ourselves, that's how we got started, really,      was about as being on the stage and giving our live performance over to      the people.  I'm glad that it will be that way, you know.  Sales, like      Nat said, definitely weren't a part of our plan.  We were just doing what      we were doing, so thankfully, you know, the fans have come and hopefully      more sales will come in the process, but, you know, that--we really      just--you know, we enjoy the stage. ",2,,374," I do not remember a time before crosswords. I did them with my mother. She introduced me to the New York Times crossword puzzle. And I do have a very early memory when she and I were working on a puzzle and there was an example of misdirection, you know, a clue that is making you think one way but in fact it's another. And she said what an amazing language and I found that's - I mean that's something I've thought of my whole life because I was thinking, gosh, is it true that the English language is more amazing than others? __EOS__ It's interesting to think about those memories. I mean, I have a very distinct memory of sitting with my dad and watching him, and learning how to do the diagramless puzzle with, you know, piece of graph paper and pencils with big erasers on them. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ ダﾝand that just sticks with you. I mean, I think once you get it you're stuck. ",0,,375," Well, politics is a little bit more complicated for several reasons. For one thing, you have often many more than just two or three candidates. Also, people are thinking not just of one or two dimensions such as quality and convenience, but they're thinking of dozens of different issues. You know, your position on the war in Iraq, your position on health care. Your position on taxes, and they're playing off all of these issues against one another in their heads. So it's a very complicated decision. __EOS__ How could the qualities that Senator Edwards projects, in theory, affect how people wind up feeling about Senator Obama and Senator Clinton? __EOS__ Before I give the example, I should also mention that the decoy effect works only if you're an undecided voter. Let's say an undecided centrist, Democratic voter, and you like Clinton on the fact that she's strong on national security. But you also want somebody who's a fresh face in Washington, and you like Obama on that issue. __EOS__ And what about on the Republican side, any guesses? ",3,,376," Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.__EOS__ I can see it now. The father that neglected me, the brothers that died. Spare me. Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?__EOS__ Mr. President, it's fantastic. Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir. You're going to be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation. If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.__EOS__ You think?",1,,377," To me Jimi is a consummate artist. He wasn't so much about going out and trying to please a crowd - but trying to create something that brought people to his vision for music, his vision for life and the way he expressed things. One of the things that was very interesting to me, in particular, as I found out more about him as a player. He never particularly liked to play the same thing the same way. You know, there's an expectation from an audience to do this thing that you're known for. And I think it's really a remarkable individual who appreciates the people who like his music or whatever they create, but at the same time feels like - I need to give you what's inside of me, not just what you think you want.__EOS__ Andre Benjamin when - the film is set in 66, 67 - you're not even born yet, you're about seven or eight years away from being born. So how did you discover Hendrix and what did he mean to you?__EOS__ I discovered Hendrix later on in life. Maybe in my early twenties and it was in a film clip. I'm not sure if it was ""Apocalypse Now,"" or ""Full Metal Jacket,"" or ""Platoon"" - I can't remember. But it was a helicopter scene and ""All Along the Watchtower"" was playing and , you know, these guitar solos just kind of hit me and it was like -who? What kind of music is this? Who is this? And from there I still didn't really know what Hendrix was about, I think most black kids that , you know , coming up in the hip-hop era , you know , you just see Hendrix as this wild character. And you're not really so much into the music - I didn't get into the music later on in life once I picked up a guitar - and you know , just really realized how great he was on the instrument. So those were my first Hendrix times.__EOS__ John Ridley - why did you want to focus on this one year in Hendrix's life? You know, most biopic's are like the whole life or a few years. It's just a really significant , really interesting and rich period. But it's , you know, a small piece of his life. Why did you choose this year - the year that he's in England before returning back to the states and performing at the Monterey Pop Festival?",2,,378," Thank you, Linda.__EOS__ Dorrigo Evans is born in Tasmania, and he lives in a battered, old town called Cleveland. I wonder if you could just read to us about Tasmania and Cleveland and Dorrigo Evans' beginnings.__EOS__  All this was in the days when the world was wide and the island of Tasmania was still the world. And of its many remote and forgotten outposts, few were more forgotten and remote than Cleveland, the hamlet of 40-or-so souls where Dorrigo Evans lived.__EOS__ We meet Dorrigo Evans as a child in the place where he began, that you just described, and in the next few pages, you show us what you're going to do in the book. You jump ahead 20 years and then ahead 50 years. Then you jump back 30 years. How come you did it like that?",0,,379," Oh, the line from ""The Simple Art of Murder.""__EOS__ Right, but there's a development known as the sociopathic sidekick, who does all the nasty stuff and leaves the hero or heroine pure. And this is...__EOS__ Hawk, for example, yes.__EOS__ Hawk is a very good example from the ""Spencer"" series. There are quite a few. And, you know, as someone who loved Robert Parker's books and considered his books to be an inspiration for my early ones, I was very aware of that tradition. I love Hawk, but it's a troubling development.",1,,380," So what does the music of 2010 tell you about where the scene is headed? __EOS__ I think it's the best year for recorded New Orleans music since the '50s or the '60s. There's been at least 20 or 30 amazing CDs that have come out, of everything from rock 'n' roll to traditional jazz to blues to folk music. __EOS__ David Kunian hosts ""The Kitchen Sink"" radio program at WWOZ in New Orleans. David, is there a track that we should go out on? __EOS__ I would go out on the track ""Boe Money"" from the Galactic ""Ya-Ka-May"" record. ",2,,381," They was not going to let that record be a - it was selling all the time and never stopped selling. And that's when they decided that we weren't - they weren't gonna give us our money. They told us back, it's not going gold, it's not going to be gold. It never went gold as far as they're concerned. They're still telling us, it never went gold. And we all know that some people have bought our record a hundred times though. They bought the classic, the CD, they download it. You know what I'm saying? And so many records are sold, but they still claim that it never sold gold. They gone on the wall of Tupac, they sell so many records Atomic Dog. Same thing with somebody else, we all know better than that. But it's catching up to them. __EOS__  May compete Nothin' but the dog in ya Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeahダﾝ __EOS__ That one could give you excuse to go nuts.

I mean, she never said to you, all right, that's fine but, you know, go get a day job? __EOS__ Not really, although maybe she should have sometimes. __EOS__ Nels, I mean, people know you for the work that you've done in rock music. You played with Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and, of course, Wilco. Do you get crossover in kind of your fan base when you play this more, you know, jazz avant-garde setting? __EOS__ Well, to a certain extent. When I go out and play with my trio, the Nels Cline Singers, it's been incredibly helpful to have Wilco fans, who are either just generally supportive of curious, show up. Because otherwise we'd have difficulty finding enough people to fill a club. And so, I'm encouraged to continue to do my own thing. ",2,,383," Yeah.__EOS__ And if it was legible, it kind of would have been your epitaph. Were you thinking that when you carried it with you?__EOS__ I can't really remember exactly what I was thinking, as far as that goes; but prior to going over to Iraq, I was chosen, my company did it, to take this one class with the mortuary affairs specialist. He was a sergeant first class. He taught me, if they're on a battlefield, for example, if there were, say, 40 people killed and we came across the scene, and I was supposed to come out.__EOS__ I'm going to ask you to read another poem from your collection ""Here, Bullet."" And this is called ""What Every Soldier Should Know.""",3,,384,"  The journey starts beneath the stars. I stand alone. I put all my fears to all these years swept away they're known. And know I run this town to be near you. And no gray skies ever turned blue. I stand alone. I stand alone.__EOS__ I don't want to go out there and say that I particularly made the song a hit. Like, I always say this to people is that it's a lot easier to recognize a hit than it is to make one. And very few of them come around.__EOS__ You used this song in the trailer before the album was even released.__EOS__ Right. And so he and I developed a relationship through Twitter to the fact where he trusted me enough to send me his music before it was out. And he sent me like five or his songs that were coming out on his album, and that's how I chose ""Stand Alone.""

And there's actually a road outside of Leavenworth, Kansas, called Stranger road. And I thought I should - I've got to write a song about that. So it's a perfect, like, you never quite know what I did wrong, but I've got to get away and I've got to get out of - I got to cross the state line is all I know.__EOS__  So take me down to the Missouri on the way to Arkansas.

But you know, basically, I don't try to capture anybody's glossary. I pretty much make it all up. I mean, the fact of the matter is, I mean, language morphs so quickly that if you were to try to like - well, this kid just used this phrase I never heard before.

We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ If you're just joining us, our guest is veterinarian Nicholas Dodman. He's collaborated with other vets from Tufts University to produce a book about caring for older dogs. It's called ""Good Old Dog."" __EOS__ Well, it's really done on a case-by-case basis but you know - and it's very, you know - so really, it is an art, again, of the science of veterinary medicine, that - well, we listen carefully and we - to what the people are telling us about the dog's life, and we look carefully at the dog. And the fact is, if they have reached a point where they've almost given up - which some people do, too; they just quit - so they are just basically lackluster; you know, not enjoying life, not playing, not interacting, haven't responded to any therapies, especially if they are losing interest in food and any social interactions, and nothing that you do can bring them back - you know, you have to think very seriously about what is the quality of life because it's not about -for humans, I would believe, too - it's not about how long you live.

Because you don't look fierce right now. You look great, but you don't look fierce.",1,,391," Well, what we know is that domestication has changed the wolf's mind really substantially. What we think is that the wolf has a very sophisticated sense of social life, of family, of family connections and so on. __EOS__ Are you suggesting that dogs, when they're puppies, actually like, study human behavior and try to learn it? __EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is John Bradshaw, author of the new book ""Dog Sense  How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You A Better Friend to Your Pet.""

It's essentially been vanquished by the car, except for in some of the dense cities of our country. You know, we need to come up with some better way of doing it. __EOS__ One of the alternatives you advocate is something called Smart Para-Transit. Now, I think most of us think of para-transit as, you know, kind of buses and jitneys that serve folks that have disabilities. What do you mean by Smart Para-Transit? This would be for everybody, right? __EOS__ Yeah. Well, you might also think about it as the airport shuttles, as well.

You know, they ride a motorcycle, they don't wear their seatbelts. Why do you think food has become such an area of attention? __EOS__ Food is just like everything else. Yes, people will make choices that are bad for their health, and the government has stepped in, in all of the cases that you mentioned, in order to make it harder for people to make those bad choices. You need to wear a seatbelt, and if you don't, you get into trouble.

Was there any concerned raised about a 48 year old man sleeping in a cabin with 10 year old boys? __EOS__ Definitely, in fact before I could do any of these things, I had to go through a background check. I would have been concerned if I hadn't. Same with the grade schools, when I went back to kindergarten and sixth grade and so on, I not only had to get a background check but I had to write a letter to all the parents and they had to agree that it would be okay.

We're talking about diversity or the lack of it in the movies, especially those with a chance for Oscar nominations. We're speaking with the San Francisco Chronicle's Asian pop columnist Jeff Yang, and also, with editor-in-chief and writer of 3blackchicks.com, Kamal Larsuel. __EOS__ You know, this is one of those things where it almost ends up being, like, ah, you don't want to blame your own community for this sort of thing, and you can't in some ways. I mean there are so many talented performers out there who are Asian and African-American, Latino and, you know, and there are filmmakers who are incredibly talented as well, you know. __EOS__ What do you think is going to be the next move or do you think there'll be a next move from major film companies on diversity? If all of this ends up to be an all-white Oscars year, do you think there will be another cycle? Because this is beginning to sound like a - there's a one big black movie or one movie that has actual Asians or Latinos in it, and there will be - and then the next two years there's nothing. __EOS__ I think that's what we're looking at, certainly. But there are bigger trends that are happening and I think the biggest of these trends is that we are looking at more and more films being made for global audiences and for global consumption. ",3,,401," He - Ellington was well-established when Strayhorn first approached him as a young man out of Pittsburgh. __EOS__ You bet. Ellington had already proven that he was a genius and didn't need Billy Strayhorn before they ever met, which was in December 1938. And Strayhorn was looking for a break. He had been working in Pittsburgh but was also a fully developed musical force already at this point, and that's something that not many people knew. In fact I didn't even know when I started my book, and that was in 1984. I finished it 11 years later. It was published in 1996. But when I started out, I had bought in to what I had read about Strayhorn, which is that he hadn't done much before Ellington found him and groomed him in his image. And I was shocked to find, after a few years of research and going back to Pittsburgh and interviewing people with whom Strayhorn had played and under whom Strayhorn had - they had worked, that, boy, got mangled. I sound like Reagan for a minute there. It was a mangled syntax. __EOS__ But I was stunned to find out how much Strayhorn had done prior to 1938. __EOS__ That great tune ""Lush Life,"" he wrote that when he was 16.

Let's suggest that because the court is full of very old guys, the nine old men, as they were known at the time, that they're falling behind in their work, and so they need some help. They need more justices on the court. And in fact, the entire federal judiciary is full of old men. Let's add justices across the entire federal judiciary. __EOS__ So how did Roosevelt's own cabinet and Congress react when this pretty radical plan was finally unveiled? __EOS__ With horror, actually, and that's not an overstatement. Most of the members of Congress and his own cabinet expected that when Roosevelt won re-election by this huge landslide, one of the biggest landslides in American history... __EOS__ Against Alf Landon.

I mean, the speed limit is 45, and you can't really get anywhere faster in this town.  It's pretty much impossible no matter how you drive. __EOS__  Nick, makes a couple of good points, Tom Vanderbilt, one of which of course, is the people who speed only to sit next to at the traffic light, which is ridicules, or you know, they go slowly over the speed bumps and then race to the next speed bump to make up the amount of time that they've lost slowing down over the speed bump.

He was actually, often, in some - there were two different desert compounds that he moved between, and very few people actually got to see him.__EOS__ When L. Ron Hubbard did die in 1986, how was that handled by the leadership of Scientology?__EOS__ Well, it was a puzzle. How do you explain this? How do you explain the death of the founder? It's always a problem, of course, in any new religion. But death is an awkward subject in Scientology, not much dealt with. So his declining health, his years of really poor health, something that people didn't know about - so the Scientology membership was not prepared that their leader was going to pass away. And it was decided that instead of dying, actually Hubbard chose to drop his body, as they said, that he had accomplished his mission here on Earth and he had gone on to higher stages, the next level of Scientology development.

Melissa now runs a Web site called Ana Death, dedicated to those like her looking for an out from the pro-ana movement. Thinking back to when she did visit pro-ana sites, Melissa says their lure was strong. __EOS__ I had never met anyone with an eating disorder before. So, I kind of felt like maybe I had found somewhere that I would be understood. __EOS__ One of the components of some of these Web sites is that people think of ""ana"" as a person, as a spirit, and you say you used to do that. Can you explain what that experience is like? ",3,,408," Well, why didn't you?__EOS__ Well, you know what? Because when you're, you know, your whole persona is that of somebody, you know, who is fun and funny and, you know, people, you know, then it's oh, well, that Al Roker.

What's holding them back from doing that?__EOS__ Well first, you know, this is something that I think some people disagree with because they say how can you make peace with an organization or with a movement that includes an organization such as Hamas, and if Fatah and Hamas were to reconcile, then by definition Hamas would be part of the new national movement or the mainstream national movement.__EOS__ If you're joining us, my guest is Robert Malley, and he is the International Crisis Group's program director for the Middle East and North Africa.

So did you have to learn how to sing to do this, or did you already know how to sing? Had you been in musicals before?__EOS__ I'd never been in musicals before. I'd always wanted to be because I did - I grew up, you know, both - as I said, both my parents having been actors. There was a lot of show tunes on in the car all of the time. So I grew up with that. I honestly didn't think it would be something for a lot longer in my career, but then when the opportunity came up to do it, I just thought, well, you know, why not.

It's about expressing yourself any way you want to. The whole idea of the paint is the tradition of the mask. In order to prepare yourself to play music, you try to put yourself on another level. You want to become out of yourself, become the music itself, you know. And to do this it requires changing something. I don't want to look the same way I look walking down the street as I do when I walk on the stage. Because on the stage is when I'm presenting my craft and when I really have to concentrate and get into what I'm doing, and the change of costumes, the paint, all of this helps. __EOS__ How did you join the Art Ensemble, or I should say, how did you co-found it?

The movie, you know, the movie was a DreamWorks movie, but Universal gave us their logo for that. And New Line gave us the logo for ""The Fatties,"" which was Jack Black's character's comedy and Fox Searchlight gave us their logo for the ""Satan's Alley,"" which was sort of like the serious, you know, gay priest movie that Danny's character was in. __EOS__ So we actually won this, you know, great battle of getting these other studios to put their logos in front of a movie that wasn't from them, but then we couldn't get the Motion Picture Association to give us the real green. In fact, they told me that the color - the shade of green that they use we weren't allowed to use, which I wanted to like take to the Supreme Court or something. __EOS__ That's right. __EOS__ Because I felt like, you can't tell me what shade of green to use.

What did you do with it as a tango?__EOS__ Actually, I like to write about things that no one else writes. And I had this discussion many times with Garcia Marquez and Carlos Fuentes. And Gabriel used to say that I was a journalist, basically, and I try to think of myself as such. So this is a story about the last 24 hours in the life of a man who's so desperate, that he makes decisions that end up tragically. And I asked Carlos - I said progressively add elements to the arrangement that depict the state of decomposition, emotional anguish and how this man is pretty much disintegrating. And when we recorded it with the Prague City Symphony Orchestra, Carlos, I remember, told the translator to tell the band, which were like 70 musicians, he said as you're playing this, if you feel that you're doing it wrong, that means you're doing it right. I don't know how that translated into Czech, but we did have a lot of weird looks.__EOS__ .",2,,416," Humbucker. __EOS__ ...is a term of art... __EOS__ It's a term of the - exactly.

So, two bridge coils. ",2,,417," Because we weren't prepared for what was going to transpire. There was a lot of unknowns. We, you know, one day we're a small town in central Florida of, you know, about 55,000 people and the next day, we have 30 media trucks from all around the nation and broadcasting around the world about, you know, what was transpiring in our town.__EOS__ You know, not long after the shooting, we caught up with Congresswoman Corinne Brown. She represents Florida's fifth district, used to be the third, where Sanford is located. And this is what she said when she first heard about this.__EOS__ One constituent came to Washington, and you know, I met him at the airport, but he had been to my office to tell me about it, white male. I'm fighting parents concerned, brothers, sisters. It's a community that is very upset as to how this matter has been handled.__EOS__ You know, in our broader conversation, Congresswoman Brown seemed to be saying that at first, she didn't see it as necessarily a racial issue. For those who don't remember, George Zimmerman is a light-skinned Hispanic, some might say a white Hispanic, and Trayvon Martin is African-American. So it's taken on racial overtones. She says that wasn't necessarily the case at the beginning. Do you agree?",3,,418," Well, this new release is inspired by a trip you took to the Canadian forces base in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in 2009. Tell us more about your trip, and some of the songs that came from it. __EOS__ Well, there's actually only one song. But the title of one of the instrumental pieces on the album also came from there. And the trip was largely motivated by the fact that my brother joined the Canadian army about three years ago, as a fully mature man. He's a doctor. He's had a career through his adult life as a doctor specializing in emergency room anesthesiology, which is a skill set that the army could really use. And they were actively recruiting doctors, 'cause they didn't have enough. So he joined and then, eventually ended up doing a six-month tour in Afghanistan. __EOS__ ""Each One Lost"" is the song that you wrote, and it was because you witnessed a ceremony. __EOS__ Um-hum. what we call a ramp ceremony. In Canada, it's when one or more of our people are killed in Afghanistan - or elsewhere they might be. So the flag-draped coffins are carried down the ramp of the back of the C-130 onto the tarmac, and there are troops assembled. And in this case, we were in Camp Mirage, which is - well, actually, it's gone now - but it was an allegedly secret base run by the Canadian forces in Dubai. That was a staging area for flights to and from Kandahar. ",2,,419,"  I salute at the threshold of the North Sea of my mind. And I nod to the boredom that drove me here to face the tide and swim. __EOS__ Needless to say, we were intrigued by this song, so we contacted the band to find out what else is on a new record. It's called ""The Winter of Mixed Drinks."" And the founding member and front man for Frightened Rabbit, Scott Hutchison. He is with me from our studios in London. __EOS__ Hi there. __EOS__ Ever since I heard this song, I wanted to ask you about it. It's about fighting the tide to get away from the shore. And it's just very delicate and beautiful song but it's also quite dark. Can you tell me the story behind it? ",2,,420,"  I'd rather be lonely than to lose you...__EOS__ Candi Staton had another incarnation as a disco queen.__EOS__  Ooh, young hearts run free. Never be hung up, hung up like my man and me...__EOS__ There was a club hit on the British rave scene along the way. And now, Candi Staton is out with a new album. It's her 27th. Some of the songs, including this one, were recorded back in Muscle Shoals at Fame Studios.",2,,421," Now, apart from the battles of the 1970s changing the relationship between the CIA and Congress, it also changed the CIA and its conception of itself. And I'm wondering as somebody who follows the intelligence community, are you surprised to see a renewed interest in the CIA in developing, well, targeted killing squads? __EOS__ Well, I mean, I think you have to understand where this is coming from. It was right after 9/11, and the Bush White House was panicking about the possibility of another attack from al-Qaida. And they basically pulled out all the stops and decided they would do everything they could possibly think of, and the same with the CIA, which came the week after 9/11 - went over to the White House with a list of things that they would like to do, and this was on the list. __EOS__ And you know, of course, there have been efforts to kill al-Qaida leaders going back through the 1990s, usually using guided missile strikes or drone aircraft. What's the difference between the military undertaking the killing of an al-Qaida operative and the CIA doing it? __EOS__ Well, the problem beneath all of this, it's very complicated, but the problem is, you know, whether or not you regard al-Qaida leaders as suspects in crimes or if they are warriors in a war. There's one set of laws that governs how we treat people in wars and another if they are criminals, and so there's been a lot of confusion about a sort of blurring the barriers there. ",3,,422," 	Yes.__EOS__  Lynn, Massachusetts?__EOS__ 	Yes, sir.__EOS__  Then why aren't you with her?",1,,423," And some dictionaries have even adopted the common usage of literally as a second definition. And that bugs some people.__EOS__ These things change, and we don't have that much control over them. You hear people using language in a way that you don't like. And I think some part of you knows that there's not really anything you can do about that. And that's frustrating. And so people start shouting about it.__EOS__ So, love it or hate it, can we just call a literally truce?__EOS__ That idea is literally the greatest idea I have ever heard in my life.",3,,424," Yeah, in sort of the best Dr. Strangelove-ian speak out of the Pentagon, it was called the passive option. And the goal or the objective was we would airdrop in these about 163-pound, man-packed nuclear weapons. They would arrive with American Special Forces, and that we would detonate a series of large passes that run through - around Azerbaijan on the likely avenues the Soviet troops would invade.__EOS__ But it would still be a preemptive use of nuclear weapons?__EOS__ Absolutely. And that was - there was an interesting series of memos I uncovered on just that point. And one of the senior officials - and this time it was early Reagan administration - raised the issue that, well, then, the Soviets might respond by dropping nuclear weapons on the ports the U.S. needed to get into Iran  Bandar Abbas, Bushehr.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is David Crist. He's the author of the new book ""The Twilight War  The Secret History of America's Thirty-Year Conflict with Iran."" So you witnessed how easily war could break out after the American invasion of Iraq, when you were in the Special Ops and you spent two weeks after the invasion of Iraq on a mission on a river that separates Iran from Iraq. What was your mission?",0,,425," Yes.__EOS__ ...you give it an original take. And that must be tricky because people are, you know, it's a food that people have a great love for in a traditional way. You want to talk about what - what is your fried chicken? What do you do?__EOS__ Yeah. No, fried chicken was obviously one of the things that you're going to open a restaurant in Harlem - there's about 500,000 people in Harlem; I knew there was about 250,000 fried chicken experts. And I wanted to, again, have some authorship in mine. Right?__EOS__ Right. And one of the details was you fry it in day-old oil? Is that right? Why?",0,,426," Mm-hmm.__EOS__ But that's an opportunity that adult life doesn't always offer you. You know, you may have children; you're not going to leave them. You may have a job and you can't, you know, you may have reasons why you can't move or change neighborhoods or go anywhere. And it makes it so much harder to change when people insists that you are who you are, and it really, I think, sometimes people won't allow you to change.__EOS__ And this is something that we continue to see in Mike's writing, and it's such a delicate art, but that Mike so beautifully writes about incremental growth. And I think so many film writers, you know, want to tackle this enormous growth where the villain becomes the hero in the hour and a half we have with them. And in the sort of long form of the season, Mike has this opportunity and so beautifully walks this line of Amy having this longing for growth and longing for some form of self acceptance. But this drive, you know, it's like I will change everyone in my life if it kills me and them too. If we all go down I will make sure the world is a better place.__EOS__ Mike, anything you want to add to that?",3,,427,"  Well, I was there at all the briefings.  I went to almost      every hearing on Iraq.  It was in the classified briefings.  I heard what      the CIA said, and then I saw what the president and Colin Powell and Don      Rumsfeld did with the information.  They distorted it, they clearly      exaggerated the significance of things that would lead us into war and      minimized the things that wouldn't lead us into war.  To me it's one of      the most tragic and irresponsible steps I've ever seen an administration      take.  And there should be accountability for it.  But that's not the      only issue.  The issue is   How do we get this thing done now in a way      that can bring home our troops and hopefully also have a successful Iraqi      democracy? __EOS__  Senator, there are more Democrats speaking on this now, but on      the whole I think it's fair to say the party has not had a lot to say      about Iraq. Several Democratic senators we've asked over the last months      to discuss the subject have declined or put us off.  Where is the party      on this?  Where are Democrats? __EOS__  It's starting to move.  I've been very critical of some      of my fellow Democrats for not speaking out earlier, talking about the      way the president has placed a taboo.  But that is breaking.  I am      pleased to say that we are now beginning to get some traction.  Democrats      and many Republicans are realizing that to be on the wrong side of this      Iraq issue is the biggest mistake you can make.  We have to be with the      American people, and the American people want change in this policy.      They want our troops to come home; they want to do it in a responsible      way.  But they want to know how and when it can happen.  It's time the      Democrats, and frankly all elected representatives, start talking      directly to the American people about that. __EOS__  Couldn't the administration say, `Look, there have been a      series of successes.  There is now a constitution in Iraq.  There's a      provisional government.  There are going to be elections in December.      Things are actually coming along fairly speedily if you look at it over      time'? ",3,,428," This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Mike Judge. He wrote and directed the new movie comedy ""Extract,"" which opens Labor Day weekend.  He also made the movies ""Office Space"" and ""Idiocracy."" Judge co-created the Fox animated series ""King of the Hill,"" and does the voice of Hank Hill. The final episode will be shown next month. When we left off, we were talking about creating the animated series ""Beavis and Butt-Head,"" which ran on MTV from 1993 to '97. Judge did the voices for both characters. __EOS__ ...are like and their famous laugh. So, here's a scene. It's Halloween -Halloween night and they're watching TV. __EOS__ Oh boy. __EOS__  Isn't this the same place that those other kids got killed two years ago? ",1,,429," Oh, I think both. I think it's supply and demand. I think people want to hear bashing things. Sometimes I think that's what saddens me more than anything, because I have a really tough skin.__EOS__  Oh, you think that you know me, know me. That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely, 'cause baby you don't know a thing about me. You don't know a thing about me...__EOS__ I want to ask you about control, Kelly, because...__EOS__ Words, yeah.",2,,430," Well, my cousins usually get people who don't believe that we're related. They kind of think, men, can you by on my job? I'm like no, men, I'm not coming by your job just to prove that we're related but -__EOS__ You know, one of the tenets of my objective, you know, is to strive for connection regardless of complexion, you know. I tried to reach out to anyone who's willing to listen. I don't necessarily make a conscious effort to, you know, target a particular ethnicity or anything like that, you know. __EOS__ And something else that has got to be very cool to you is ダ_Nashville Star.ダ __EOS__ Yes. ",2,,431," You told me something that I had never heard before in this book, that Jane Austen had big fans in the trenches in the First World War - a sense of Austen and other literature of her period as a moment of escape. __EOS__ Thats right. The 18th century novelists and writers were very popular in the trenches in the Great War. And yes, Austen was used in the fever chart that the War Office drew up to treat shell-shocked soldiers. She was put top of that chart, in terms of how therapeutic her works could be in a dire situation where a man was grievously wounded and needed to be read to. Austen's novels were thought to be the most comforting. __EOS__ I think there are a lot of people in the 21st century who feel that way about Jane Austen. Certainly I do. I have three of her books on my electronic reader for, you know, when things go horrible on me, I can sit down and read for a little while and calm down. __EOS__ You know, when Im on an airplane, for instance, I always turn - if there's a Jane Austen adaptation, I will watch it for the Nth time because I always feel as if Im in mortal danger on an airplane and I want the reassurance of Austen or, you know, a similar writer and the comfort of that known thought. ",0,,432," Well, you know, I'll tell you one thing that you're going to be riding a little bit of a distance, so one thing that you need to bear in mind right off - and this is a typical mistake that people make - don't roll your knees in and grip with your knees or you aren't going to have any hide left on the inside of your legs real early on and you're going to suffer the rest of it. So think about kind of turning your toes out and let your legs kind of wrap around the horse.  __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ And put some weight on the ball of your feet. Just like if you're going to do anything athletic, work off the ball of your foot. But if you can keep from having the inside of your knees touching that saddle, you apt to survive it. And surviving, really, is a good start. __EOS__ That's what I'm hoping to do. Thanks very much for the advice, and we appreciate you taking your time on the road there... ",1,,433,"  And Casey, I don't want to be a spoiler because people want to see the film.  But it's not easy always to participate in an activity like this.  It's just, some kids in some neighborhoods, just, you know, getting the band practice will be a big deal.  But to some of these kids, they have to pick kids from school. They have to pick up their younger brothers and sisters. They have to do a lot of the other things that a lot of other kids don't have to do.  So is there one sort of hope that you have that people will have when they see this film? __EOS__  The hope that I have is that they'll see it as a kind of a blueprint for something they can do with their own schools.  I mean, it has done such wonderful things here for the band programs at D.C. for the first time ever. And last year, there's one point four million dollars of brand new instruments delivered to all the schools.  The documentary, you know, had something to do with that.  A lot of people saw it. A lot of district leaders saw it and made a difference. __EOS__  Many of the people who are featured in the film have, in fact, graduated and moved on to other things now.  So, Darrell, do you have some rising stars?  You have to reconstitute that band every couple of years. __EOS__  Yes, absolutely.  But I just want to acknowledge them.  There are a lot of students who went to college, you know, Johnson C. Smith University, that they stayed on scholarships, and we're very, very proud of them. But the underclassmen and the seniors now have really stepped up, and they really help the freshman class that's coming in to be the best band that we know we can be. ",2,,434," I think that the argument for releasing them is that the sentence was out of order with the crime. And I think that their lack of a prior criminal history plays into it, the fact that the people who did the sort of active robbing, the three men, they've long since served their sentences and have been released. And again, I should point out, the sisters themselves still profess that they're innocent of the crime. __EOS__ Is there anyone arguing against clemency at this point? Is there anyone arguing that their sentence is appropriate and that they should serve it out? __EOS__ Well I've spoken with a spokesman for the governor and they haven't said that anything about whether the sentence was appropriate, inappropriate. What he has said is that the governor doesn't want to overturn a jury verdict. This is probably what stands in the way of a pardon for the Scott sisters which is what a lot of advocates have pushed for. I don't think that that appears very likely, because Governor Barbour, I just don't think wants to overturn a jury verdict that way. __EOS__ How big of a deal is this case? You mentioned in your reporting that it's gotten a lot of national attention from some national columnists, like for example, Bob Herbert of The New York Times. But what about locally, I mean do people - are people engaged by this, disturbed by this? ",3,,435," Oh, yeah. And to have to work with such an outsized personality, ego and say, hey, whatever it takes, its there and you got to, you know, and you got a go for it and sometimes it doesn't work and a lot of times it does. And so you just keep on pushing, you know. __EOS__ So let's hear ""Beast of Burden"" and this is from the Stones' 19... __EOS__ Please do. I love that one. __EOS__ Me too. The 1978 album ""Some Girls,"" ""Beast of Burden."" ",0,,436," A new film explores the story behind her role in ""Deep Throat."" And for all of you NPR political junkies, we're not talking about the source for the Watergate scandal. The 1972 film turned Linda Lovelace into a porn star and a household name.__EOS__ But when the cameras were off, Lovelace endured a complicated private life of abuse and coercion at the hands of her husband. Jeffrey Friedman and Rob Epstein direct ""Lovelace,"" a new biopic about the actress which opened on Friday in some theaters and also on demand. Jeffrey Friedman and Rob Epstein, welcome to the program.__EOS__ Thank you.__EOS__ Thank you. Pleasure to be here.",1,,437," Yeah. __EOS__ And he saw it happened. So it's nice to sort of legitimize these wonderful stories. __EOS__ Yeah. There's some uglier ones too though. __EOS__ Yes. I mean they all had their dark side, very much so. Less so Peter O'Toole, but I think the others  something about the Celt, isn't it? The dark side of the Celt. ",0,,438," Thank you.__EOS__ You're welcome.__EOS__  My favorite picture of you is bent and it's faded, and it's pinned to my wall. Oh, and you were so angry it's hard to believe we were lovers at all. There's a fire in your eyes, you've got your heart on your sleeve, a curse on your lips but all I can see is beautiful. My favorite picture...__EOS__ I've seen you say before that when you're writing, what's not in the song is as important to you as what's in the song; not given too much information.",2,,439," So, realizing that she's not wrong, she's just different. __EOS__ Exactly. Exactly. __EOS__ And same for you. __EOS__ Exactly. Exactly. And, you know, in fact, say another quick thing, in other words, you know, getting out of my experience as being raised in a single-parent household, I had to learn how to show affection to my wife in public. You know, when we would go out before, I kind of just would sit there and kind of, you know, just be checking out the scene and, you know, looking at what's going on. And, you know, she'd be, like, hey, how come I'm not getting the attention, the affection I need? ",3,,440," Sure.  You are not a child, and I am not your parent. There is practically nothing writerly about your process. You're acute and omnipresent anxiety causes you to function much more as an accountant or a producer with his eyes on the bottom line and no understanding of how artists function, rather than as a young writer trying to develop a first novel - a new career. In short, you are as mean and ungenerous to yourself as your parents are. They taught you well. You are no longer 20 as you were when we met. You are pushing 30. The wounded child in a defensive rage has become an adult man, hurting himself and inflicting pain on others. Your inability to empathize makes it difficult for you to put yourself in the skin of the characters you write. You have to decide to take yourself seriously - not in a phoney, self-pitying way, but in a serious, dignified way.__EOS__ And the letter goes on. What was your reaction when you got that letter?__EOS__ I was, of course, furious. What, you rich American, what do you know of what my childhood was like? What do you know what it's like to be me? Just go and write your soap operas.__EOS__ What hit hardest from this letter once you were able to actually stop being so defensive and digest some of it?",0,,441," Well, you know, Ed, we're like 15 days out before the hurricane season starts. We still have a couple of cooperative endeavor agreements to finalize. But we had to put this plan out to the public with the best information that we had at the time. __EOS__ How much are you satisfied with what you have received since the catastrophe and certainly to today from the federal government? We saw a lot of help after 9/11, particularly in New York City and Washington, D.C. as well. But how much federal help are you able to say you're happy with? __EOS__ Well, you know, the federal government responded pretty late--in my opinion--to this catastrophe. And they're still somewhat late. They like to tout the fact that $100 billion have been spent. But most of that was contractors that were under the Corps of Engineers of FEMA's control. And when we got a local contractor involved, it was at the bottom end of the totem pole and the profit margins were squeezed above. __EOS__ Mr. Mayor, there are a lot of people who are concerned about whether or not--not only during hurricane season, but certainly for the immediate future--whether or not the healthcare system in New Orleans is going to be enough to service the city. Whether or not you're going to have, as the city gets up and moving, enough buses--many of them were flooded and destroyed through Katrina--to really start to move the city. Many people rely, as you know better than others, on public transportation. How much of these ills can you really service immediately? ",3,,442," But building a joke around a giant silo of pig crap, that was hard? __EOS__ I'm not - lookダﾝ __EOS__ I am not particularly proud of - well, I'm proud. I'm proud of everything. __EOS__ I'm thinking about other cartoon characters or comic characters that have lasted for decades. When you think about Charles Schultz's drawing Charlie Brown, and he's the same simple kid with the same round head and he's constantly having the football pulled away from him. And you wonder what subtle thing it is that Charles Schultz kept getting, that kept him interested in that kid for decade after decade after decade. I mean, I don't know if you have any insight into that or any insight into what it is about Bart, say, that keeps you interested year after year after year. ",3,,443," Yeah. __EOS__ And that the price that she exacted upon her family, upon her daughter - upon both of her daughters - may not have been the equation in her mind as maybe this wasn't worthwhile. __EOS__ Dani Shapiro, thank you so much. __EOS__ Oh, thank you. ",0,,444," And it was, again, something that Jim Baggett actually helped facilitate. I very much wanted to know what life was like on the other side of the color line but also what life was like for those officers. I wanted to know what kinds of stories they passed on to their children. I wanted to know how they dealt with a city where things changed so rapidly for them, where the ground literally shifted under their feet. __EOS__ We make assumptions about those people, not always justified, as it turns out. And nevertheless, one of the interesting things, his last words to you, as you turned to leave, after getting to like him, I think, and he said to you  In some ways, it was better then when each had their own. __EOS__ You know, I actually got to like him quite a bit. Aubrey Justice is a wonderful man, and it was surreal because the more I talked to him, the more I realized that he and my father had so much in common, and had my father lived, they may have acquired many of the same habits. __EOS__ Michele Norris, her new book is ""The Grace of Silence  A Memoir.""

Wow, you know.__EOS__ Not your average run-of-the-mill chords.__EOS__ Well, there's C, F and G or there's, you know, there's weird ones. You could do three weird chords, I suppose if you wanted to.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.",2,,446," How do you get her to want to do it, though?__EOS__ Just kind of promote her. You know, in other words, I let her know if you do this, you know, mommy's got this for you. Like, she wants to do certain things on the weekend. So I say, well, you know, did you read that book I asked you to read? Or did you read that book for half or whatever? You got to put the work in before you get to play. So that's what I do with most of them. I make sure that they have their, you know, rewards system, especially the oldest one. Especially DeVaughn, because he can just...__EOS__ The reward system works for him?__EOS__ No, but...",3,,447," We're not super bright. We have a very bright audience. In fact, the album title itself, ""The Ash & Clay,"" we were on stage in New York. I think Joey was giving me the business about the punctuation that I put into song titles.

Thank you so much for joining us.",3,,450," I was very aware of drugs when I was growing up, but I only started noticing heroin a couple years after I graduated high school. And in 2002, 2003, I started hearing about classmates of mine who passed away from heroin overdoses. I remember being, like, a preteen and just kind of looking around at my classmates and thinking, oh, that person's really good at such and such, or that person has talents in that - and imagining that when they got older, they would be successful at that. And it's a real shame to hear about them dying - or just some of them got so into drug addiction that it ruined their life for a while.__EOS__ The headline of your piece was ""How Did Idyllic Vermont Become America's Heroin Capital?"" So you mentioned some things like weather - you know, long, boring winters and, you know, it's just - anyone who lives in a cold climate can relate to that. But are there other things that you think are contributing factors? Like, for example, is there like, a history of people not wanting to talk about things like this, or trying to keep appearances up because tourism is such a part of the place? What do you think are some of the other factors that emerged?__EOS__ Some of the experts told me that Vermont has always been an opiate state. Even back in the 1800s, farmers' wives would use opiates to kind of cope with long, boring winters. So Vermont always seemed to love its downers. But I think another huge factor is the highway system in Vermont. A lot of highways come in from major cities. It's very accessible. So the highways basically work as pipelines for heroin dealers, or for traffickers that live in Vermont that want to just drive down - takes like, a couple hours - pick up some heroin, drive it back up.__EOS__ One of the very factors that makes it an attractive tourism state is one of the factors that makes it desirable for people to bring drugs in, I guess - right? I think some people who are not familiar with this whole subject are puzzled by what seems to be a resurgence of heroin. I mean, I think for a lot of people, this is like something from the '60s or '70s and now, all of a sudden, we're hearing about heroin again. Why would that be?",3,,451,"  All the other kids with the pumped up kicks. You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun.

Bye-bye. __EOS__  Here we are as in olden days, happy golden days of yore. Faithful friends who are dear to us, gather near to us once more. So have yourself a merry little Christmas now. ",2,,455," Pinay means Filipino woman. Since our country was conquered by the Spaniards for many, many years, the Filipinos, the native ones, lost pride in their indigenous beauty. And ""My Funny Brown Pinay"" celebrates the unique attributes of an indigenous Filipino woman  someone who has flat nose, black hair, dark skin, brown skin. And this is what I'm trying to communicate to my Pinay sisters. __EOS__  Don't, don't, don't you change your hair for me. Not if you care for me. Stay, my funny brown Pinay. Stay. I want you to stay. I want you to stay. Each day we celebrate our way. The Filipino way. The Filipino way. Pinay. __EOS__ Are you someone who tried to lighten her skin and become different from who you really are? __EOS__ Yes. I was a victim of this. When I was growing up in the Philippines, I remember using every type of cream, every type of papaya soap ダ_ because we believed the papaya soap lightens the skin ダ_ and I used it to hopefully wake up the next day and be fair-skinned. ",2,,456," My question was what role did Jawanza Kunjufu, if any, played in your writing of this book? __EOS__ And tell us who that is. __EOS__ He wrote the book ""Countering the Conspiracy to Destroy Black Boys,"" and there was one previous to that, ""The Conspiracy to Destroy Black Boys."" And see, the book told how boys lose interest in school after the first grade or so in the inner city. And I just wanted to know had he heard - had he had any experience from that book at all? __EOS__ Yes, and the book is actually mentioned in my book. ",0,,457," ...we're still waiting for someone else to do it, you know? Like... __EOS__ People don't realize that, you know, we did it all ourselves. And when you think about it, a band who had no idea how to do anything - not even plug guitars into amplifiers back in '79 - and by 1981, be the number one band in America, the story of the band is pretty incredible, actually. __EOS__  When I see you, I lose my cool. Lust to love was the last thing I was dreaming of. __EOS__ Now that you are 30 years out from the women that you were when you wrote this music, performing it, how does it feel to you? ",2,,458," When kids start that young, like, between the age - like say 2 and maybe 6, they get how to play certain instruments, you know, and they pick things up faster. So I really didn't scratch on the instrument. My brothers, they would tell the truth, because they had to practice in the basement, I didn't - the dog didn't howl when I played, soダﾝ __EOS__ We used to laugh because sometimes I'd go to my lessons and my teacher would say you didn't practice this week. And my mother would say, yes, she did, she practiced every day. Now whether she was doing it right or not, I can't tell you, but she did practice. __EOS__ But I got a lot of encouragement from not only my family, but the teacher, because she saw that I was gifted. She really encouraged me and pushed. You know, I got to do some TV appearances at a very young age, but I loved the stage. I just loved the applause and getting dressed up. All that went in to being a performer, I really loved it and craved it. I knew like I have to have this, I have to do this, from a pretty early age. __EOS__ Jazz Violinist Regina Carter. Her new CD is a tribute to her late mother, who got her started on the violin. The disc is called, I'll Be Seeing You  A Sentimental Journey. ",2,,459," Yeah. Gary, thanks very much for the call. __EOS__ There's an element we looked at in the book, about when something like that happens, like the situation that Gary describes - is something happens called personal elevation. And it turns out that clicking with people tends to really bring out the best in us. And even in experiments where they had a group of MBA students who either clicked together or didn't, the MBA students who clicked together, the teams were much more efficient at their task, they were much more effective, they were much more equipped, they were much more supportive. And it turns that there is something about the - even in a battlefield, again, brings out the best in us that we can then endure the situation. __EOS__ We talked about some of the accelerators for clicking. Similarity is one of them. And interestingly, you'd think that it would be the most profound things that are - that need to be similar. You share the same religion, like one of those emailers who called in before - who'd sent in a message before. It isn't necessarily quality. It's quantity. __EOS__ It's a quantity of the similarities, and it can be really silly similarities. In one city, they told people that they had similar fingerprints. Or in another one, they had people with fairly common names. So, say, Neal, you left a room and all of a sudden, you're approached by someone who was wearing a nametag and - also happen to wear a nametag named Neal. So they wouldn't - they excluded anybody with weird names, like Ori and Rom, on there so because...

Yes, indeed.__EOS__ So - but indeed, the basketball championships are over. I guess we're going to be playing professional basketball until - well, probably mid-summer sometime, but eventually that'll be over, too. The Stanley Cup Finals are just beginning. But Dan Okrent, it's baseball season.__EOS__ Yeah, it's great, and it'll be particularly great when all those other things are done, when all those other back-and-forth sports, as Red Smith called them, have continued - have run their course. And then we'll have that period for about six weeks between the end of hockey and basketball and the time that the NFL players report to camp, and it will be only baseball, and I'll be a very happy man.",0,,461," Yeah. Yeah, you can. You can look - I mean, there are certain things, the landscape and the vegetation and your sense of how people might have felt about, for instance, Spartacus. __EOS__ I mean, he sowed terror in the hearts of Romans. You write  His army took prodigious quantities of revenge in death, rape and drink. __EOS__ Yeah, and I know that's not the kind of Kirk Douglas idea, but there's truth to this. Well, obviously, there are many truths to this story. I'm not saying it's the only way to look at it. But if you're on the road, and if you're seeing it through Roman eyes, through the eyes of the people who are living there, and you go to their little houses and their little shops that are - some of them are still being excavated in Capua, you see the guys struggling to make a living; okay, they had slaves. They might not be considered good guys today. But these were guys desperately trying to make something of their lives, and slavery was part of their lives. __EOS__ After leading a rebellion for two years, eventually, Spartacus is defeated by Crassus. He's killed in battle. Crassus decides that all of the rebels who survived should be publicly crucified along the Via Appia, that ancient Roman road, 6,000 of them are crucified. That meant every 40 yards, there was another rebel crucified, and you walked along that path. What was that like? ",0,,462," Yeah. I was in a band. I didn't like playing in the band. I didn't like where we were musically. I was very shy. I was a little overweight. But I answered this advertisement, and I went to see the guy in the office. And I said I can sing and I can write songs, and I said but I can't write lyrics.__EOS__ So would it have ever occurred to you to look for a lyricist to collaborate with?__EOS__ Because I knew I couldn't write lyrics.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.",3,,463," And how many books do you have left in the reference library? __EOS__ Well, we have only now really a couple of hundred that are just kind of backup in case - I mean, this never happens - the NPR computer goes down, or the power is out. And then there are still a few of our users who do like to use print. __EOS__ Do you still have that great OED on that wooden stand that used to sit in front of the library? __EOS__ No, but we have another. We do have an unabridged dictionary on that. ",0,,464," Right. __EOS__ You do. __EOS__ So, well these were - when I first read the Haggadah, it was back in California and I had gone to the local temple and bought a Reconstructionist Haggadah - it's a branch of Judaism - and that was our first Seder. And everybody had views. You know, oh, you left out this part, or, well, you know. Oh, wait a minute, you shouldn't have put that part in. And all of that. __EOS__ Uh-huh. ",0,,465," It is, still. __EOS__ The Syracuse paper reported, Society Girls Go to the Wilds of Colorado. __EOS__ Yes, they did, and their parents were shocked and almost didn't allow them to go, even though they were 29 years old. And Rosamund's mother said, when she realized that Roz was serious about this, that she was fully competent to make this decision herself. But it was a long trip across the Great Plains - it took four days. And where they were going, high up in the mountains, it was just a tiny settlement of 25 families or so. __EOS__ Talk about where they lived. ",0,,466," Really, one of the coolest aspects of this book is that the students at Brakebills College act like real college students. __EOS__ Elizabeth Hand reviewed ""The Magicians"" in the current issue of Fantasy & Science Fiction Magazine. She says the novel is beautifully written, with well-drawn, believable characters. __EOS__ I mean, these are kids or students who are having relationships with each other. Some of them are having, you know, romantic or sexual relationships. There are students who are gay, as well as straight, students occasionally making references to drugs. This is not your mother's Hogwarts. __EOS__  If you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcruxダﾝ ",0,,467," Let's just go back a little bit and just talk about, you know, the sport as it's meant to be played. You were one of the first American sports columnists to cover soccer, and, in fact, you actually played yourself - you don't probably mind my mentioning - not terribly well.__EOS__ Oh no. I mention it myself. In fact, I got a nice little award for the American Soccer Federation last year, and I got up there, and I said if you had ever seen me play full black for Jamaica High School in the mid-1950s, I guarantee you would not even allow me up on this stage.__EOS__ Talk a little bit more about what you actually like about it.__EOS__ What I like about it is the creativity. When I watch good soccer players - the way they have to make a play out of nothing. The other night when the United States were playing Portugal and was in trouble during the match - their hard guy, midfielder Jermaine Jones - he worked his way around a screen, dribbled around two defenders - ball swerved, hooked inside the post and scored a goal the U.S. desperately needed. And why did Jermaine Jones shoot that? - not a scorer. It came to him. He saw - He created. I love that creativity.",3,,468, Yes. Because they were... __EOS__ ...because he was giving so much useful information. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. Yeah. __EOS__ He was the one who indentified all of the suspects from 9/11. He'd worked with them. He knew them. ,1,,469," Well, it says that slavery played a role in the formation of the convention and that too often we had not acted to promote racial equality, and we apologize for that. We lament that. We grieve over that and we repent of it and we ask for the forgiveness of our African-American brothers and sisters. __EOS__ The plea also asked forgiveness for Southern Baptists having failed to support the civil rights movement. At the time of the apology, before a meeting of 25,000 Southern Baptist delegates, Reverend Gary Frost of Ohio delivered this response. __EOS__ On behalf of my black brothers and sisters, we accept your apology and we extend to you our forgiveness in the name of our lord and savior, Jesus Christ. Ephesians Chapter 4, Verses 31 and 32, say let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice, and be kind, one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you. __EOS__ That was Reverend Gary Frost of Ohio, accepting the Southern Baptist Convention's 1995 apology for racism.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",3,,470," No. Well, but it has piqued your curiosity, Scott.__EOS__ What we are trying to do is to get people to think and, you know, not just necessarily to passively consume things but to make people think, 'cause we do a lot of complaints from people saying, oh, that's not true, that's not true. But actually, these things are true. It's a bit like tweeting, you know. I know you're a king tweeter. And to get something that concise is quite difficult. Sometimes you have to leave out bits like qualifications, like nearly, almost, as many as. We tend to round up the numbers a little bit but it's essentially all true.__EOS__ Is there a fact that you just haven't been able to wrestle into verisimilitude, if I could put it that way?__EOS__ Yeah, there's some, I must say, there are things in the book that you wonder who spent their time finding these things out - that giving hamsters Viagra helps them recover from jetlag 50 percent faster. I mean, who put a hamster on a jumbo jet to give it jetlag and then tried some Viagra on it? Who's, who's wasting public money doing this?",0,,471," Hi, thanks for having me here. __EOS__ You've got a whole lot going on right now, but I want to start with the ""Web Therapy"" show because it's already in its third season. How did you get into the idea of doing a Web-only show. __EOS__ Well, we were asked - Dan Bucatinsky, my partner and I - we were asked to do a Web series years ago, and the answer was no because we weren't really interested in doing that. They mostly seemed to be sitcoms that were broken up into five-minute segments, and  but I kept thinking about it anyway. And I just had thought, well, if something's on the Web, it should be quick and about the Web, and then I just the worst idea on the world on the Web would be a therapist who only sees people online on an iChat thing and for only three minutes. __EOS__ And then add the fact that she's kind of a jerk, you know. I mean... ",1,,472," Here's my question. I seem to remember back when Chrysler bought - or when Daimler bought Chrysler that  they said one reason might have been because Daimler was looking at Chrysler having billions of dollars in the bank to cover health care costs and retirement benefits, and there was some suspicion they might take those funds and use them for other things. I'm just wondering if that ever happened. I'll take my answer off the air. Thank you. __EOS__ Okay, thanks for the call, Nick. Can you help him out, John McElroy? __EOS__ Yeah, absolutely. He's absolutely right. I can't remember the exact figure, but there were some $10 billion or thereabouts flying around, and ka-voom, that money just disappeared as soon as Daimler got its mitts on Chrysler. So where that money went? It probably went into their general accounts fund, and who knows what it was spent on? __EOS__ Mm-hmm. And in terms of return, I wonder - one of the things that Daimler said going into this deal is, you know, we're going to bring all this wonderful German technology to Chrysler and improve their product line.

The only way that I know that I'm getting older is because I still look at women the way I looked at them when I was 20. __EOS__ They just don't look back at me the same way. __EOS__ All right. __EOS__ So you all have a great day. ",0,,476," My problem in school was that I would get in trouble and obviously the teacher would call my mother in. And it's funny 'cause we actually just spoke about this recently. I'd always tell her, like, don't worry, I know right now that I'm not getting the grades, but I know that at the end I will get it 'cause I know what I'm doing. I just have trouble paying attention. __EOS__ You are a self-described synesthete, in other words, you see sound. How is that reflected in the music you make? __EOS__ Well, the thing is for a long, long time I ignored it. And it was only being in the last couple of years I've really started to kind of play around in regards to what I see, to what I create. __EOS__ Is there an example of that, because when you're talking, I'm thinking about Sir George Martin who used to say that he thought about Beatles arrangements in terms of colors, a similar sort of thing. Is there a tune on this CD that you find you applied that to? ",2,,477," That's right.__EOS__ OK. Well, go ahead. Well, then just go on to the sort of - you had similar experiences, though, of kind of being made to feel that you just weren't good enough. I mean, do you want to talk about that? Just what gave rise to your book? Let's just say that.__EOS__ Well, I think that, when you're raised in Asian household and you're expected to get straight As, you're expected to do everything perfectly and there's no room for mistakes, I think the parents might feel that they are spurring you on, but what happens is you just feel spurned and you learn to detach from them and that's probably not what they wanted in the first place.__EOS__ Anupy, what about you? What's your experience?",3,,478," Yeah, and he undercuts the Hemingway story by one word. Actually - this is another thing too, about 'hint' fiction, because the stories are so short, the title is really part of the story. __EOS__ Let me read Eric Siu's story, ""An Impromptu Robbery.""

My pleasure.__EOS__ George Gershwin, often considered the classic definitive American composer, died in 1937 at the age of 38. This, of course, was long before you were born.

I know you've been there before. __EOS__ It was really not a nostalgia Chico journey. It was a way of connecting my father back to the island that he loved, a way of bringing peace and also really a nod to the Cuban people and to the great legacy that they gave our American art form; what we call our American art form, jazz. And so when we went down there, it was about also giving my sons a chance to interact with the future and, of course, the Cuban musicians a chance to interact with them as well. __EOS__ What did you think of your father's music when you were growing up? __EOS__ I grew up in New York City. My mother and father spoke with an accent, and so I rejected everything Latin or Cuban. The music that he wrote that was jazz, I embraced it though I wasn't quite yet convinced as a jazz musician. It wasn't until I was 12 that I really discovered Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock that I embraced that part of my father. And I didn't really embrace the Latin Afro-Cuban genius that he was until I was well into my 20s.

So I want to play you singing in the methadone clinic in your pink rhino costume.",1,,482," Writing this book seems to have had a profound effect on you, including becoming part of the reason why your personal story has changed. While writing this book you got married, and you and your husband have a son.__EOS__ I had always hoped that I would someday have children, but I'd never known quite when or whether and I certainly didn't know how. And I met John, who's now my husband, at almost exactly the same time that I sold the proposal for this book back in 2001. And he then told me that he had been the donor for some lesbian friends and that they had a son of whom he was the biological father, Oliver - who was supposed to call him ""donor dad"" but because he couldn't quite understand the word, kept calling him ""donut dad"" instead. And then a couple of years later Tammy and Laura asked him to be a donor again and they had a daughter, Lucy. And then one of my best, best, best friends from college had gone through a difficult divorce and she and I were talking about it.__EOS__ Well, your thoughts about becoming a parent were pretty much tested right at birth when your son George was born and there was a period you thought he might have a profound disability. Describe what happened.__EOS__ So George was born. We were all in the delivery room, Laura, who was carrying the pregnancy and John and I. And when he was born they noticed that there had been a knot in his umbilical cord and they said they thought everything was fine but if the knot had tightened that it could've cut off oxygen to his brain.",0,,483," Well, yeah, it is. And it - you know that you're not going to be in for a lot of laughs and good times. And he just said it was early. And I knew - first of all, it's not early because half of the play he's 40. And second of all, the older you get, the harder it gets, because physically it's a mother. I mean, it's two hours and 45 minutes on stage for Willy, to begin with, and tearing his guts out to continue. And you can't fake it, which is the final blow.__EOS__ Did you go back - I know you saw the play, but not with Lee J. Cobb. Did you go back and see the movie?__EOS__ I saw the movie long ago. Weirdly, I was at the University of Chicago when I reviewed movies for the - could it have been called ""The Maroon,"" or was that some other school? I don't remember what it was called, possibly ""The Maroon."" And I reviewed the movie of ""Death of a Salesman"" in that paper in Chicago. I don't remember what I said, and I don't remember what I thought. I do remember seeing the play and realizing that we were late seeing it. It was great.__EOS__ When you go back and look at it, obviously you're trying to clean up what actors may have introduced. But also, in the immediate part after you've just staged it, I'm sure you go back and say I made a mistake there. But after you get some distance on it, are there moments, at least, when you can say, hey, not bad?",1,,484,"  Where are you from, Israel? __EOS__  No, no.

My guest is Jay-Z, and he has a new book. It's called ""Decoded,"" and it is part memoir and part a collection of his lyrics, with the stories behind them. And I want to play another track here. And I want to play ""December 4th"" because it's - it's so autobiographical and about the period of your life that we're talking about, and also because your mother is featured on it.__EOS__ Yeah, I tricked her.__EOS__ We'll actually hear her voice, yeah. Did you say you tricked her?__EOS__ Yeah, it was her birthday. It was actually her birthday - December 4th is my birthday, which is the title of the song - and it was her birthday, September 17th, and I told her to meet me down at the studio, that we were going to go to lunch and - for her birthday.",2,,486," Michel, I'm a lawyer.

Not only is it talked about, you see the disparities that exist throughout the system, whether it starts at policing all the way through resources, prosecution, you know, defense availability, sentencing, so thus through the judges. You've seen the disparities that exist across the board.__EOS__ Just to clarify, the crime rate in your district is not twice that of the rest of the country. So do you agree with Marc Mauer that this is really about policy? It's not that the crime there is so out of control that that would lead to this kind of result?__EOS__ I would agree that it is not only about policy but it also about discretion.__EOS__ Hmm. Can you talk a little bit more about that? What do you mean by that?",3,,487," Salvage actually means a lot to people around here 'cause we - all of us scrap out metal, all of us. It's like a - just a thing you do. You save your piles of metal and then when you have a lot you go to the - one of the metal recycling centers. They've only recently started calling them metal recycling centers. They were always called, you know, salvage yards.__EOS__ One of Campbell's stories explores a human being who's been tossed on the scrap heap. It's called ""The Inventor.""__EOS__ That story was inspired by a family story. I grew up on a creek and there's a pond right near us, and a generation before there had been a guy who was actually a friend of my uncle's who had built his own homemade scuba gear and had drowned in the pond. And so that was a story that I always knew. It was kind of a local tragedy, and so that was something that had been rattling around in my head since I was about five years old.__EOS__ I have to tell you, in reading that short story, there is in there a memory of that tragedy of a young man who tries this homemade scuba gear and drowns. But that is by no means the most present tragedy in this story. It's almost forgettable compared to what you create on top of it. Would you describe the main character of that story?",0,,488," He started explaining this case to me where we received information from a very trusted source that this man had been tortured so badly that his face was unrecognizable. He talked about how he had been tortured psychologically, physically but also sexually. And I kept thinking - I was like, who could this be? Like, this case is very, very severe. So then he told me at the end - and right that it's Abdulhadi al-Khawaja. It was my father being beaten.__EOS__ When you found that out, when you found out this severe case of being beaten beyond recognition was your father, there must have been a moment, I assume, when you thought I have to stop.__EOS__ No. I mean, I never got to the point of thinking I have to stop. But I think, you know, this is the same poor judgment on part of the governments that they thought doing these things will push people to think we have to stop. But it actually has the opposite effect.__EOS__ Razan, someone else that you feature in the film in Libya actually gave his life to the revolution. A 21-year-old American, Muhannad Ben-Sadik, left his home in Virginia and decided to fight with the rebels there in Libya. And here is a piece of his story told by his father, Osama. Take a listen.",1,,489," Well, the German colonel in the camp in Kundus thought these fuel trucks to be a major threat to his camp and his soldiers because they could have been transformed into what you might call a rolling fuel bomb. So he ordered in the air strike by  planes, carried out by F15 fighter planes from the U.S. Air Force because he didn't enough ground personnel to tackle the Taliban fighters. __EOS__ And apparently, as many as 142 people killed in that attack. And now, it's believed dozens of civilians died as well. At first, the German military denied that there were any civilian casualties. The two military officials who resigned today, did they know about the civilian casualties? Did they cover it up? __EOS__ They did know about it, even in the evening of the air strike they had reports from German military police that in the hospital of the German armed forces in Kundus, people were treated - very young people, children were treated for injuries they had during that air strike. __EOS__ Mr. Thiels, these resignations are coming at a time of great debate over military involvement in Afghanistan, not just here in the U.S. but also there in Germany. Your parliament has to decide whether to extend Germany's mandate to fight in Afghanistan. Your country has about 4,300 troops there now. What is the tone of that debate?

Many are those movies are movies most people have never heard of. He was sometimes a leading man, but often one of the, you know, character actors, secondary actors. And then, after the war, he's in serials. He's in ""Batman and Robin"" serials, playing Commissioner Gordon. In ""Superman"" serials, he's Lex Luther.

And so I tried to, I started to re-imagine the story from her point of view. But then as she started to talk, I live in a small town, other people started to talk and I let them talk and they started to, at first it was a kind of elegiac chorusing around a tragedy. And that's how the voices started to come in.  __EOS__ That might be a good time to ask you to read from the book, if we could, in the voice of Susan Hazen.  __EOS__ Certainly. This is the first paragraph of the prologue. And this is Susan Hazen.  __EOS__ I remember reading that, and what struck me was that somehow with that oblique reference to that killing frost.  ",0,,492," It actually put Nashville on the map real good because sequin suits and things wasn't working out I think - cheating songs and stuff. These songs were fresh, and they were different from what was going on.__EOS__ And Shaver learned something about his role in country. He would never be as big as the stars who sang his songs, like Waylon Jennings.__EOS__ Because the songs were so big, they were too big for me. I couldn't possibly get them across the way he could.__EOS__  Where do we go? The good Lord only knows. It seems like it was just the other day.",2,,493,"   If I don't love you, baby,      grits ain't grocery, eggs ain't poultry and Mona Lisa was a man.  Oh,      yeah! Let's get into it!  Listen! __EOS__  That's ""Grits Ain't Groceries"" from 1969.  Little Milton died of      a brain aneurysm at the Delta Medical Center in Memphis this week.  He      was 70, but still touring and recording music.  His most recent album was      this year's ""Think of Me."" __EOS__  How ya doin', Scooter? __EOS__  I'm fine.  Thank you, sir.  Just fine.  What was Little Milton      like? What do you remember? ",2,,494," Fine, thank you. __EOS__ Really, I didn't want to get off track myself either with the question, but I'd really like to hear you talk a little bit about, you know, the natural decisions that we make with what's right and what's wrong with language. And maybe I'm going to hang up after the question, but may you just talk a little bit about where we get our natural sense for language and the path that we take for them. And also, I'd like to - for the listeners, if they could visit meaningfulscience.com. It really gives you meaning to the applications of science today. __EOS__ Okay. Michael. Thanks for that. Let's hear Dr. Pinker's thoughts on that. __EOS__ Well, people do have very strong feelings about what's correct and incorrect in language, which is a mystery to linguists because there actually isn't anyone who decides what's correct or incorrect. And probably, eight out of ten of the judgments of what's correct or incorrect have no basis in anything. People will say it's incorrect to use hopefully to mean it may be hoped that or one mustn't split an infinitive, or you can only use since to refer to time, not to logic. And there's no rhyme or reason to a lot of these prescriptions. And if you go back to the history of language, you find that many brilliant writers have always used the forms that have been deemed incorrect. ",0,,495," Let me ask a question. Are you nuts? __EOS__ You know, am I? I would say definitely not. I would think probably more on the sane side than most of the people that live in cities. And really, I'm doing it not only because we're able to but because for us it's like an exploration. What can we do? How far can we go? And really, I do it to continue to develop my relationship with the ocean and have a more intimate and a deeper relationship. __EOS__ Are the number of hundred-foot rogue waves on the rise? __EOS__ What I really discovered from talking to numerous scientists is the answer is most likely yes. A very large rogue wave comes as a result of a very big storm and then the instability of the waves, the steepness. Steep waves lend themselves to sort of freaking out and becoming these rogue waves that are very unstable. ",0,,496,"  I am talking about revolution in the way we do mortgages.  It would have to be priced in to the costs of the mortgage. __EOS__  Let's go to Eric in Nevada City, California.  Hi, Eric. __EOS__  Hi, how are you doing? __EOS__  Good.  Go ahead with your comment. ",0,,497," The other question I have here, and this is always a question that -you know, politics is the means by which government happens. So I don't mean this in any diminishing way, but there are those who would say  Do you think that this is politically motivated in the sense that the administration wishes to have the support of conservative evangelicals? or is this driven by other factors, values, instinct, the president's own sort of personal conviction about the way these issues ought to be addressed in society? __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ I know I'm asking for your opinion, so I'm interestedダﾝ __EOS__ Yes and yes. I mean, I think - nothing happens at the White House - from who gets invited to dinner to, you know, what the first kids wear to school - everything's a political decision. ",3,,498," Thanks, Melissa. It's great to be here. __EOS__ And now to someone who works on that complicated formula of what makes a great teacher. Steven Farr is with Teach for America. Thats the organization that places top college graduates in urban and rural schools around the country. __EOS__ Thank you for having me. __EOS__ And youve gone from classroom to classroom, watching teachers, figuring out what it is they do, looking at case studies. One thing you found that they share is that they set ambitious goals for their kids. What would you say is an example of what one of those high goals would be? ",1,,499," So how did this kind of material go over? __EOS__ Half the people would laugh, obviously, because  and half the people would go - oh. __EOS__ And I'd get half the people laughing, but it was  you just didn't talk about things like that. It was never discussed. Even discussing that my mother wanted me desperately to get married and had a sign up  it sounds so silly now  she had a sign up  Last girl before freeway. __EOS__ And people said  You can't say that. You can't talk about things like that. But in those days, that was pushing the envelope. And it's so funny because I opened things for women that were then able to talk about. ",1,,500," I was incredibly lucky. I don't think I could have done this thing. And ""Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?"" is essentially a two-part Batman story. I was asked if I'd like to write something that would be a two-part story that could be the last episode of Batman comics and then the last episode of Detective Comics, where Batman started all those years ago. __EOS__ And Detective - DC comics is called Detective Comics because it's DC, Detective Comics. __EOS__ Exactly. And in Detective Comics number 27 back in 1939, Batman made his first appearance. So it was very fitting that the last Batman story in Detective got to be, what, they've got to be in Detective. __EOS__ ダﾝthese forgotten '40s Batman artists.

And Lisa and I are both reporters and, you know, you get a tip and you start chasing it down. You call on somebody. And this one just had an unusual amount of dead ends in it. You know, it finally got down to the point where we found out that, Lester, the guy, who had built the rig, had died. __EOS__ Inherited the rig, and he was taking care of it and cooking on it and he will cherish it. __EOS__ Oh, right.

They're more conventional and you have more of a ダ_ what'd she say? Like a creative spirit or something.__EOS__ Yeah, she said  Your parents are very lovely people but terribly conventional. You're like me; you're an adventurer. You'll have to prove something.__EOS__ Did you take that to heart?__EOS__ I paid attention to it.

",3,,507," OK, Mikki, let me bring you into this. I mean, it is true that we have to use IDs for all kinds of things - getting on an airplane even, you know, renting a car, for example. I mean, what if a government makes it very, very easy, I mean, to get a government issued ID? Does that change the argument over IDs at the polls?__EOS__ Well, it will eventually change the argument, but the push to make a bill happen now ignores the fact that significant portion of the population, especially if we're talking about rural black people, in North Carolina for instance, may not have birth certificates. They may not have ever had a photo ID as we think of it. Because for a long time, especially when we're talking - say the 92-year-old woman who sued, you didn't need photo ID to have a job.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ And now we're coming to a place - I've worked in the past for the government, we're coming to a place where we're seeing people - as we talk about cars and passports and whatever, a significant portion of the poor American population does not have access because they were born at home. And that's a conversational topic that I know has been covered in North Carolina.

Do you see a chance for Obama to make headway on this issue? __EOS__ I think it will be extremely difficult. I think that there's a level of despair on both sides in that conflict that says, basically, we just can't move forward; we better settle in for the long war and the long confrontation; there's not going to be any peace. You feel that more and more. That doesn't mean it's impossible to make peace. There are still some frameworks that may be useful, particularly the Arab peace plan of 2002. But the Arab League itself is fractured. They - going into a recent summit in Kuwait, there were two, sort of, counter-summits before it, during the Gaza fighting. __EOS__ He's also talked about, of course, an opening to Iran. There was a piece which you and a colleague wrote about the views of former American hostages, who were, in fact, the last diplomats, American diplomats, to be in Tehran. What insights can you offer about Obama's prospects for a productive engagement of Iran? __EOS__ I think he has to be a tough negotiator, but talking is negotiating, and that was certainly the approach that was being suggested by these former hostages and former senior American diplomats. You know, I don't think they had any illusions about how treacherous, really, the Iranians can be in negotiations and how tough they are. But the key thing that Obama has done, and I think this is an absolutely central - is absolutely central to any kind of peace process, and particularly when dealing with Iran, is to understand that Iran is a rational actor. Ahmadinejad, the president of Iran, may say irrational things, but the policy establishment of Iran is extremely rational. It has different and conflicting objectives with the United States. It doesn't think the way we do, but it doesn't behave illogically and irrationally. And once you understand that, then you say, we're going to sit down and we're going to have tough negotiations and tough talks, and there's going to be a lot of walking away from the table and a lot of walking back, but you can talk. ",0,,511," You did? __EOS__ I used to do it a lot when - you know, right after ""Dookie"" came out. I was arrested for it in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I did it at Madison Square Garden, because I didn't know if I was ever going to play Madison Square Garden again. So I, you know, I said, well, there's one way to remember this occasion, is to be the guy who was naked on stage at Madison Square Garden. __EOS__ So what statement were you making by taking all your clothes off? __EOS__ It was, like, this non-statement statement. You know, I mean, there was no - I just was - it was, you know, old enough to know better but too young to care, you know, kind of attitude towards it. ",2,,512," A lot, a lot, but that's not to say that the book is just roman a clef. No, definitely not. But I drew on emotional experience and emotional maturity, let's say, to - for the second voice, the mature voice. __EOS__ Of Mira herself. __EOS__ Of Mira, yeah, the grown Mira. Because there's a young Mira, there's the 25-year-old Mira and then there's the older Mira, who's looking back on her love affair, on her first marriage, on her arrival in Europe. __EOS__ The chapters in Lost Hearts are dated, but the dates are not in chronological order.

Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",2,,517," Were you ever blacklisted yourself? __EOS__ Absolutely. In the witch hunt. And theres an example of what they do. The climactic scene in that story, in that movie was shot and neatly cut out. __EOS__ What was the scene? __EOS__ The scene was where the Barbra Streisand character says to the Robert Redford character - he says to her the studio says I have a subversive wife and they will fire me unless you go and become an informer. And he wants her to inform to save his butt. And she says well, there's a very simple solution, willy-nilly circumstances forced you into this. I will get a divorce. You won't have a subversive wife. What they kept was willy-nilly circumstances forced you into a solution. I will get a divorce. The whole business about informing and subversion, which was what the picture was basically about, they cut out. They said the public doesn't want it. They want a romance. How did they know? I don't know. Maybe they were looking in a crystal ball. But it's so unsatisfied. ",3,,518," So you do actually semi become the guy in a way. __EOS__ Youve called - and like in the commentary part of the new DVD version of ""Bruno"" - youve called homophobia the last prejudice that youre allowed to have in many places.

You should know me better than that. We have different enemies. You should know me better than that.__EOS__ We love each other a great deal, but we're - but there's often a lot of conflict between the two of us and...__EOS__ And there's some fun imagery in one of the verses  Can you turn the TV down? You should know me better than that.__EOS__ Yeah, yeah. The lyrics to that are like a bunch of little fragments of just thoughts, you know, about him. And truthfully, it's about us actually getting to know each other as adults, because I went off to college when he was a little kid. He was 9 when I was 18 and went off to college, and then I moved to New York after that. And he kind of went his own - a different path. And the song a little bit - I think I had a lot - felt a lot of guilt, because I think, right, when maybe he kind of needed an older brother the most, you know, when you start hitting your teens, and that's when I sort of took off and disappeared on him a little bit.",2,,521," Half a dozen?__EOS__ Thirty-three.__EOS__ Wow. So Barack Obama's day is constructed by 33 people. And imagine you're the first lady and, you know, you're worried about him getting enough sleep, or the kids, you know, have an event at school, or you want to interface with your husband's schedule, as all spouses do? Well, you know, what is the right procedure for doing that? Who does she talk to? And especially, this is a first lady who is very aware of not wanting to seem like a meddling spouse. Part of the sort of dramatic tension in her story is that she is always veering from on the one hand having the attitude of I'm going to stay out of this, this is his administration, I'm going kind of create my own separate world and, you know, not engage with what's happening in the West Wing. And then at other times she gets drawn in because she's impassioned about what's happening, she's a worrier, she's very concerned.__EOS__ Another example is these emails about the television show ""Morning Joe."" So during the campaign she watched ""Morning Joe"" a lot and she was often concerned by what she saw there. You know, they're saying this about us, you know, what's our response to that, etcetera, etcetera. And she would send emails to campaign aides and ask him those questions. And some of those advisors, the way they described them to me is, you know, look, this was hard to deal with because it's a presidential campaign and I'm dealing with a thousand different things and I just don't know what to do with the candidate's spouse, you know, wanting me to somehow do something about something that was said on ""Morning Joe"" three hours ago. So in the White House what's interesting is that she continues to send those emails, but she doesn't send them directly. She mostly sends them to Valerie Jarrett, who is a senior advisor in the West Wing and a close friend of both Obamas, and what Valerie does is that she takes Michelle Obama's name off the email and she forwards it to other aides. And so what we're seeing is a first lady who is trying to find her place, right, who is trying to find a way to talk this stuff she's worried about, but it's not so clear who she should talk to and when she should raise it and how.",3,,522," I was hoping to accomplish musical growth and evolution, musically venturing out. Without making a polka record or a rap record. it represents musical places I've never been until now. __EOS__ Your most recent studio releases have been collaborative. You worked with the Innocent Criminals and the Blind Boys of Alabama and your band, Fistful of Mercy. Why did you want to do a solo project at this point in your life, in your career? __EOS__ I've always based and gauged whether or not my records would be band or solo by feel and timing, and it just felt like the right time. And the songs felt lyrically like they were leaning towards it being a solo record. Now, there's also more to it than that. This is my 10th and final record on Virgin/EMI. __EOS__ I want to listen to the first single from the album. This is a great number. It's called ""Rock and Roll is Free.""

Was he trying to hold you up, or what?__EOS__ No, no, it was a guy who was a part of a theater company on the producing end, and did not want his wife even to have it. So, you know, I was over at the house with a character actor friend. We were just beginning the season. And he had kind of lost his bottle, and he came out and pointed this gun.",1,,524," Were there any songs that Ben sent you the melody to that you thought, oh, that wasn't the song I thought I was writing at all? __EOS__ I guess the closest to that was ""Practical Amanda."" There's a song on Ben's second album called ""Kate,"" a beautiful upbeat, sunny pop song. And that was my kind of conscious attempt to write ""Kate,"" I suppose. And Ben wrote this incredibly moving ballad. And Amanda happens to be the name of my wife, so I sort of blushed when I heard it. __EOS__  Practical, practical Amanda.

It's just Johnny Cash and his guitar and I just particularly love this CD. They're so beautiful and there's so much feeling on this. And I dont know if youd listened to a lot of these kinds of songs before, so I'm interested in what the process was like for you of just hearing Johnny Cash sing spiritual after spiritual. __EOS__ I thought it was beautiful and it was interesting how it came about. Johnny had found - the title of that album is called ""My Mother's Hymn Book,"" and Johnny had found his mother's hymn book, the actual one that she sang him songs from the time he was born. And these are songs that he'd been singing since he was four years old and they really helped form who he was as a person and as a singer, so he felt more connected to these songs I think than any songs he ever recorded before, and very second-nature for him to play them. __EOS__ While you were recording these songs, did it give you insights into Johnny Cash's relationship with religion and spirituality? ",2,,526," Yeah, exactly.__EOS__ And Seth, your favorite?__EOS__ I think maybe ""Ghostbusters"" is probably one of my favorite movies.__EOS__ But I think we can both agree ""Big Lebowski"" encroaches on both of those.",1,,527," No, I'm not being childish, but I want them back, and so, you know, I do have to behave myself.__EOS__ So can you give us an example of something that you actually, you know, talked about whether to use or not, use that was...?__EOS__ Yeah, I mean, it was with Tony, the jockey, you know, the - we just, we've had long discussions over the last three or four films about the changing racial profile of the East End of London, which he left and he left because, you know, he regarded it as being invaded by Bangladeshis, you know, by people from particularly Asian communities, and the East End of London has changed dramatically.__EOS__ Michael Apted, speaking to Terry Gross last February.

And in each of these cases I think you say that these Chinatowns were a safe haven for the immigrants who first arrived in those states, in those areas. And still plays that role for new immigrants in this country. __EOS__ That's right. Particularly in New York, San Francisco and L.A., which are the longtime ports of entry for Chinese to this country. And the amazing thing is they still remain so. Even, you know, this far into the history of Chinese in America and today that those three cities and their surrounding suburbs are still the first places where - many Chinese to this country who immigrate here will come through because of the kinship networks. And of course there's - you mentioned that it was safe haven. It was safe haven from racism in the inception of the neighborhood and through much of its history for sure. __EOS__ Yeah.

If you read Rick Warren's ""Purpose Driven Life,"" it reads, from one perspective, very much like a cognitive behavioral therapy manual.__EOS__ Well, you know, you write the basic task of learning to respond to God in a church like this is learning to believe that you are truly loveable just as you are. And I would imagine that it would be very reassuring to think that. Not everybody thinks of themselves as being loveable.__EOS__ Absolutely. I should also say that, again, it's really tough. So people get snatches of it. They have long-lasting moods. But, you know, they still drive home from church and yell at their kids and feel like they failed at work. It's more as if they have a little bit of extra bolstering to carry with them.__EOS__ What about the wrath of God? What about sin and hell and damnation, which has been the emphasis in many churches?",3,,536," Some of these songs were not necessarily upbeat. Some of them were, at least in earlier recordings, very, very somber.__EOS__ And they still are if you, you know, if you really get into what they're saying, but because they feel the rhythm and the pattern and the grooves. The grooves that he put them in helped me to sing them with a lot more lightness.__EOS__ Joe, I want you to talk to me about the accompaniment between a vocalist and a pianist. And I want you to explain, if you could, the dance that takes place between the two of you when you perform.__EOS__ If I feel that a singer needs me to inspire them, then I would begin to do things to inspire them. But when I see that a singer is inspired, I make sure I don't get in the way. And in the right moment, I will continue the inspiration. That is the beauty of making music. You have to touch your instrument, your sensitivities and your feelings the same way that the other person has.",2,,537,"  Hey, there's a lot of great Spanish words that rhyme with my name, Mando. That means that they end in the same ""ando"" sound. Here, I got a few for you.  Here's one word that rhymes with Mando, and that word is cantando. Estoy cantando means I'm singing. El cantando rhymes with Mando.__EOS__ Mando, Mando, Mando, Mando.__EOS__ That was Ismael Cruz Cordova as the latest featured character, Armando or Mando. He was born and raised in Puerto Rico. He earned a bachelors in fine arts from New York University. And ""Sesame Street"" just kicked off its new season this week, and it's putting a special focus on Hispanic heritage. Ismael Cruz Cordova is here with us to tell us more. Welcome. Congratulations.__EOS__ Thank you so much, and thanks for having me.",3,,538," Christianity today, Dr. MacCulloch, is a huge religion, one-third of the world's 6 billion people. And for many of them, Christianity's viewed primarily as a Western faith. But you tell the story, as you just mentioned, the ancient Eastern churches and the Eastern influence on the church. Could you tell us about that? __EOS__ Yeah, sure. I wanted to tell the story in a sense the wrong way around but the right way around because the church should have been an Eastern religion. After all, Jesus spoke an Eastern language, Aramaic, which is a version of Syriac, which people still speak in parts of Syria today. And youd expect that to be the future. __EOS__ And Christians, of course, fled Jerusalem in 70 AD, after Christ's death, because of the Jewish revolt against Rome, right? __EOS__ Yes, they did, and that seems to me a huge turning point. If there was going to be a city for Christians, it would have been Jerusalem. But once Jerusalem had been destroyed and, I mean, the Jews had gone, the Christians had fled even before the Jews had rebelled against Rome, then somewhere else would have to be it. And the first candidates were not Rome or even the city which didn't exist then, Constantinople. It would be places like Damascus - or Baghdad could have been the center of Christianity rather than Rome. ",0,,539," I think I was writing because that's what I do. In some sense it controls the feelings. If they are written about, they are more manageable. If I am writing, I'm breathing. I'm living the way I always lived. So I think that the writing of it was certainly helpful to me and a part of what I was doing. And I'm sure that writing it changed the experience; that I would have had a somewhat different experience if I wasn't constantly trying to capture what I was seeing and feeling, that that affected what I was seeing and feeling. __EOS__ I want to get you to read a section of the book, if you could, to describe this period for us. __EOS__  I feel a surge of envy when I see a woman about my age in a restaurant with her spouse, the two of them talking softly. Are they planning a vacation or worrying about their kids, a job lost, a divorce, a setback of mind or body? Are they talking about their friends, analyzing this or that foible, this or that peculiarity? Are they talking about the abductions in Baghdad or the CIA prisons hidden in byways of foreign countries? Are they discussing his blood pressure medicine or her next dental appointment? I am becoming selfish. I can't remember other people's birthdays. I forget to ask about their children. I am self-absorbed, that is to say it takes all my energy to hold myself together. This may be a normal response to a great loss. I expect it is. But I do not like myself like this. If I were a polar bear, I would go into a cave and hibernate. __EOS__ And yet as you say, as Herman, as H, your late husband said, we're social animals, we can't do that. ",0,,540," You're not?__EOS__ No. Yeah.__EOS__ Well, for what it's worth, I think you dodged a bullet. I didn't want to say anything before, but that guy has big-time gay face.__EOS__ OK. I'm going to stop you right there. I'm still engaged.",3,,541," This woman on - Oprah, yeah. This woman on television who looks like she could be a relative of mine and she speaks well and she's respected and people really love her. And that gave me a lot of hope in watching her. But, no, there weren't very many people that I can say.__EOS__ Can I just ask you about money? When you started making money, which is something you never had and it was something that you lost - you lost everything you had on your first production - what were your dreams of what to do with your money? Was it to, you know, just, like, reinvest it into more of your work? Or were there, like, material possessions that you really wanted?__EOS__ I had one dream and it was to - and when I was a kid I told my mother I would take care of her so she wouldn't have to deal with my father. And I didn't know how much of a driving force that was until she died. That had been the burning fire in the pit of my soul for many, many years. And I never thought any amount was enough.__EOS__ When did she die?",1,,542," No, Lincoln always insisted that that phrase meant everybody. The question is  what does it mean when you say they're created equal? __EOS__ Before the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln was a supporter of colonization. Why don't you explain the concept of colonization for former slaves. __EOS__ Colonization was the belief that former slaves should become free. It's an anti-slavery position. It's a way of abolishing slavery. Slaves should be freed and, depending on who you are, either encouraged or required to leave the United States. They should be sent to Africa, to Central America, to Haiti. __EOS__ So with colonization, was the idea that African-Americans in the North, who weren't slaves, would also be expected to leave for Liberia or South America or the Caribbean? ",3,,543," Some blacks felt the Fisk Jubilee Singers were pandering to white audiences. But Brooks says there were fans, including Bohemian composer Antonin Dvorak, who believed black Americans should look to their own roots and traditions for music and build on them. __EOS__ Another very prominent school of thought was that no, they should show that they can do everything that the white man can do, and do it as well, or do it even better. That is, follow the European tradition, go into great art, and show how well they could do it. Roland Hayes himself pursued that very strictly. __EOS__ Roland Hayes was the most prominent singer to come out of the Fisk Jubilee Quartet. __EOS__  My soul is a witness for my Lord. Oh, my soul is a witness for my Lord. Oh, my soul is a witness for my Lord. Oh, my soul is a witness for my Lord. ",2,,544," Hey, thank you so much for taking my call. Mr. James, you've also got a skill set that makes you incredible successful at this. Do you think that the focus in junior high and high school on sports tends to make kids forget about the academic pursuits as much. And it's also where I live, there's a football rivalry between two school systems, Union and Jenks, and this has actually turned into a nationwide phenomena, and they are recruiting kids from, like, elementary school for these programs, and I just can't help but think that that's going to affect, you know, their academics and the other stuff that they're focusing so hard on just that one narrow sport or that one narrow talent or whatever. Do you think that it should be a more rounded program or less emphasis put on the sports and more on the academics or whatever? And I'll just take my answer off the air. __EOS__ All right, thanks, Chip. __EOS__ Well, honestly, I think, you know, kids should definitely understand that education is important. I think when you're really, really young, you know, you're seven, you're eight, you're nine, you're 10 years old - it's really hard to get a good grasp of what education means. So I think as you continue to grow, you should start to get a little bit better. __EOS__ We're talking with LeBron James, now of the Cleveland Cavaliers though once among the stars of the St. V Irish in Akron, Ohio. We're also talking with his high school coach, Dru Joyce. If you'd like to talk with him, give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr.org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan.

They're remastering a      1940 recording of the Brahms 2nd Symphony. __EOS__  So the problem is to succeed in joining the sides and at the      same time to give a bit more emphasis on the first note of each new side.

Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",2,,547," Sonic Youth eventually did sign with a major label and that helped it land opening slots for such better-known acts as Neil Young and REM. The band drew its widest attention for the 1988 album Daydream Nation, which this spring was added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry. __EOS__ Just as they got the chance to open for established acts, musicians of Sonic Youth like to pick adventurous younger bands to open for them, says Lee Ranaldo. __EOS__ Our audience seems to be able to handle whatever kind of weird opening acts we turn them on to. I mean, sometimes it happens to be something like a band like Nirvana or Mudhoney and other times its just weird noise crews that we dig up. __EOS__ There are second and third generations of kids now who are getting in Sonic Youth. ",2,,548," You are looking at a right - always looking at the country or to -it's own motherland or fatherland from a distance. And then, like the lady was saying, there's certain things, when you're in the country which you actually take for granted. When you've left, you begin to hear even the sounds of birds, the rivers and the wind. Everything becomes different and much more intense because you now have an element of longing with you. And that becomes part of the creativity, as well. __EOS__ Let's take a quick call here before our break. Louisa is in Norman, Oklahoma. Hi, Louisa. Hi, Louisa. Are you there? __EOS__ Oh, yes. Hello. This is Louisa, calling from Norman. I'm from - originally from Guinea-Bissau and also been, you could say, in exile for three decades now. I've lived in Europe. I've lived in England, France, and I now live in the United States. I've been here for 20 years. And this past summer, I went back home. And much like the writer from Iran has said, you know, you feel alien in your own country. __EOS__ Oh, right. Louisa, we've got to leave it there, but thank you so much for calling and sharing that. We'd like to hear from other writers and artists in our audience. If you've left your home country, how has it influenced your work? 800-989-8255. I'm Jennifer Ludden. It's TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. ",0,,549," Yeah, this is from ""The Spared Man,"" one of A.N. Dyer's probably last books.  Sometimes Louis saw in his sons a mirror that reflected the best of who he was, and he was in awe. Other times, he hoped to see nothing of himself, and would insist on molding the opposite, by force, if necessary. Fatherhood is the bending of that alpha and that omega with the wobbly heat of our own fathers mixed in. We love and hate our boys for what they might see.__EOS__ That's kind of a theme through the book.__EOS__ Yes, for sure.__EOS__ Fathers and sons and sons and fathers and what they see in each other. So why was this the subject you wanted to build many subplots around?",0,,550," Hi, I'm wondering if you have any insight into husband-wife relationships, in that the emotional disconnect that often happens in these relationships is a source of stress. So, I'm wondering if your research can maybe provide some help for us wives who try to emotionally connect to our husbands, and it goes unappreciated because it's not masculine enough. I'll take my comments off the air. __EOS__ Thanks, Shannon. __EOS__ Absolutely. I would say that, I would think it would help a lot if, I certainly learned, number one, that I used to interpret men's silences or men's terseness as a lack of willingness to communicate. When in fact, I don't think that's true at all. I think it's reflective of a different style of communication, and it's partly reflective of this emotional denial that's been caused, the way that they're socialized. So it's not, I think it gets read as an unwillingness, and that brings about a fight. __EOS__ You discovered, Jim was one of your friends, your special friend in the bowling team. But he and his friends told awful sexist jokes, went to stripper clubs, and you said, had absolutely reverence for their wives. ",0,,551," I'm talking to the singer and songwriter Josh Ritter about his debut novel, ""Bright's Passage."" __EOS__ Well, the first thing I'll say, it was - is that it was very - like a song, it's very - it's a very beautiful combination of really, really hard work and a lot of joy, you know? And I've always considered that what I do first is tell stories, and how I choose to tell them has been with songs up to this point, but that I've now found this new way of writing in this new format. And, yeah, I guess, it is pretty nervy to come out with a book, but it isn't. It's something I've just been so excited by that, hopefully, when people read it, they'll accept it in the spirit that it's offered, which is with a lot of excitement and a lot of joy. __EOS__ Josh Ritter's debut novel is called ""Bright's Passage."" __EOS__ Thank you. ",2,,552," Everybody recognizes those themes, but we haven't heard them in Afro-Cuban music played by a salsa band. __EOS__ Yeah. It's going to be the first time that you're going to dance with Johann Sebastian Bach. __EOS__ . __EOS__ This CD that you've made is the music of Bach, but it's not just that it's set in Latino music, it is set in Cuban music. What does that do to be so connected to a place in the music that you play and yet not connected to it in your everyday life. ",2,,553," Thanks, Dave.__EOS__ You know, a long time ago there were, you know, the three major networks which could produce television which got a huge national audience. And then cable came along and fragmented, you know, the TV viewing audience. And we also saw, you know, more narrowly focused channels, food channels, a history channel, shopping channels, you know, fishing channels. Does YouTube think there's a market for even narrower niches?__EOS__ Yes, they definitely do. I mean they see the Asian channel, for example, which there doesn't really exist on cable, or an Asian sitcom or a transgender channel or a cricket channel or a horseback riding channel. There are a lot of sports and pastimes that have a large group of people interested in them, but they're not necessarily based in one country. And one of the unique things about YouTube is that it's global. So you can put together an audience of cricket lovers from many countries around the world and achieve a pretty large audience. But if you just tried to do that in one country, you'd get a fairly small audience. So YouTube allows you to kind of aggregate these disparate audiences in various countries and put them together into one pretty good size chunk.__EOS__ Right. And they're going to be, you know, commissioning, you know, professional performers or content developers to make stuff for them. Who are they asking to produce channels?",3,,554," Well, that's his trainer trying to deal with what people are saying about him. And he's telling him, you know, he doesn't want to hear it. You know, this is not the place for this. This is the fight world, you know, and he's dealing with his own issues in terms of trying to come to terms with who he really is.__EOS__   In this world, it's  to ban. You bury him. You lay him in the dirt. That makes you strong. That makes you not afraid. That makes you not weak.__EOS__ You know, all of these arias are very personal moments. And, to me, they speak to that moment in everyone's life when you have certain types of quiet reflection. So the arias are written in such a way where there are moments in time that kind of step out from the rest of the opera.__EOS__ Yeah. I'm speaking with Terence Blanchard. He's making his debut as an opera composer tonight in St. Louis with the work titled ""Champion."" On top of everything else that you're doing, you just released this fantastic new album with your jazz combo, reminding us of your jazz chops. It's called ""Magnetic."" And, you know, I've read that some of your music here was partially inspired by your practice and study of Buddhism.",2,,555," This is a Main Street story as opposed to a Wall Street story, but there were certainly parallels between the two. And some of that is ignoring the obvious and certainly pertaining to this idea of self-regulation - doing what's right - even though you can get away with other things. And this was kind of examining when good people make bad decisions. __EOS__ Let's talk about this world of high school wrestling... __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ ...and why it seems so funny. Why do you think - I mean, if you've done a basketball movie or a high school football movie, it just wouldn't pack the comedic punch, right? ",1,,556," You and your sister presumably pursuing a lot together. Did people say to you you have a great voice? __EOS__ No. __EOS__ I think at points, they just wanted us to stop. It was this thing where we couldn't help it, you know? If there was something on the radio, you know, I had to sing along. If there was anything playing anywhere, I had to sing along. __EOS__ Professionally - to actually do this for a living? ",2,,557," Yeah, another phrase that begs the question - and because when people use it, that's not what they mean at all.__EOS__ You just violated another one. We think begs the question means raises the question, but it doesn't. The phrase goes all the way back, at least, to Aristotle, I won't try to say it in Greek. He gets credit for putting the name to a habit many of us have that makes no logical sense. When someone begs a question, he's giving you something of an answer, but not one that really says anything. He's speaking in circles. Let's say you and I are talking about rock 'n roll bands. I say The Beatles were most people's favorite group. You say yeah, man, The Beatles were the most popular band because everybody liked them. You've accepted my premise and then just repeated it. You didn't offer any real support or logical reasons for your conclusion.__EOS__ But what about the argument that, at this point, that phrase - begs the question - has been so widely misused, the meaning of it has been changed?__EOS__ Well, there is an argument to be made that when things get into common usage we ought to start using them. I think - we think - we should try to stick to Aristotle's original meaning. And remember, there's an easy fix. Just say raises the question when that's what you mean.",3,,558," You know, it's just kind of a general feeling of loss, and there's a grieving, I think, in that song. Something has been dismantled somewhere. And we're sort of floating in a void of that loss, and nothing has come to replace it yet.  __EOS__  Our patriarch with greasy hands, he held the golden cage's keys. For 20 years he sailed the seas with a trumpet on his knees.  __EOS__ Kevin, you wrote that song. Was it prompted by - you know, was there a funeral going on?

",2,,561," Terry, we haven't addressed this as a nation. It was astonishing to me amid all of the debate we've heard about the Social Security system that there is no similar system for veterans. All of the care that Tyler Southern receives, all of the surgeries that Todd Nelson and other burn victims will need over the next several years, all of that is paid for out of the annual appropriation from the Veterans Administration. And so what that means is that it's a political football every year in Congress - how much are we going to appropriate for the veterans. And you know, if I were veteran and knew that I was going to need new prosthetics a year after next, I'd be kind of nervous because there have already been proposals in Congress to slice back funding for veterans' health benefits.  __EOS__ My guest is David Wood and he is a 35-year veteran combat reporter, but he has a new series called ""Beyond the Battlefield"" that's about veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who are returning home with catastrophic wounds that need long-term care and that are totally life-changing. ""Beyond the Battlefield"" is published in the Huffington Post. The series continues through next week.  __EOS__ My guest is David Wood and we're talking about his series ""Beyond the Battlefield,"" which is published in the Huffington Post and continues through next week. It's about catastrophically wounded soldiers from Afghanistan and Iraq who are coming home with their lives transformed and requiring long-term care, perhaps care for the rest of their lives.  __EOS__ I got interested in telling the stories of people who were caught up in conflict. People who were fighters, people who were refugees, people who were victims - the vast number of people who work constantly to resolve conflict and to get sides talking. I never felt that by reporting the stories of people in conflict that I was endorsing conflict in any way. ",3,,562," As the war ended, he wasn't a public figure yet. He was certainly very well-known within the British military and political hierarchy. He was already a legendary figure within the Middle Eastern branch of the British army. He became very famous in England the following year, in 1919, when Lowell Thomas did this travelogue about the war in the Middle East, and he realized he had something of a matinee idol in T.E. Lawrence.__EOS__ And what did English people think of him? What did - how was he regarded?__EOS__ I think this travelogue show that Lowell Thomas put on became an instant hit. By the time it finished running, I think over a million Britons had seen it, including the king and queen of England. I think the reason it was so popular is that it was this idea of the war in Arabia being this clean war, this romantic war and Lawrence being this dashing figure in Arab robes charging over the sand dunes, in contrast to, of course, the war on the Western Front. There was virtually no way to romanticize, you know, the ghastly trench warfare which had killed so many, you know, young English soldiers.__EOS__ Now as a young man, he ends up in the Middle East and there of course becomes involved in momentous events. And his life is portrayed in the David Lean film ""Lawrence of Arabia."" And I wanted to just play a scene from that. This is early in the film, and in the film, the Peter O'Toole character we see here, this Lawrence of Arabia, is at a desk job in Egypt and then gets sent off to assist in the Arab revolt against the Ottomans.",0,,563," During the season, Mickey would be out of the lineup for a little bit, and he would be introduced to come in as a pinch hitter, and there'd be an ovation that was absolutely tremendous. And I didn't see that for Roger. __EOS__ We thought Roger Maris was terrific. We hoped that he would hit 59, and Mickey would hit 61. __EOS__ When we came to work each day, the press would come in. They'd all go right to Maris' and Mantle's locker. Well, Mickey knew how to handle them. He could walk away from them, but Roger was just, because of his shyness and so forth, portrayed in a different light altogether. And so the pressure was on him. He was losing his hair. Mantle, it didn't bother him at all. __EOS__ You know, he was a guy from Fargo, North Dakota, a guy with little use for all the trappings of fame and celebrity. ",3,,564," Actually, this one, the end of the movie, the palette gets a little more relaxed. There's some color in the Wild West show at the end of the movie just because we, Jess and we wanted to sort of - it had to stand apart from the main body of the movie in some way, and that was a means of doing that, stand apart in terms of feeling and period. __EOS__ Now, after seeing your ""True Grit,"" I thought, I'll go back and watch the 1969 version with John Wayne because I'd never really seen it before. I've seen a couple minutes here and there while channel-surfing, but that's about it. __EOS__ With all due respect to the Duke. __EOS__ You know, I must say, we saw the movie when it came out, when we were kids. We haven't seen it since, although we did see the trailer, and it's in so many ways shocking. ",1,,565," Oh, I'm glad you picked that. That's my favorite one.__EOS__ Oh, good. So is this - did you know this would be your final album when you recorded it?__EOS__ It wasn't my final album. I made an album after that, that I'm really proud of, called - it was called ""Adieu False Heart"" that I made with Ann Savoy down in the Cajun country. And it's - I had no voice left and I was just crafting whatever I could craft together, but I hung onto Ann and we sang this harmony duet and it was an unusual sound. I really loved that record.__EOS__ When you say you had to, like, refashion your voice, like, what did you have to do differently in these early stages of Parkinson's when you were still singing?",3,,566," Yeah. And I went to that courthouse and saw the exact spot he would have walked out when he got his freedom looking up the James River as it kind of winds up into America. I mean, it was a - it's a beautiful spot.__EOS__ You stumble across many people with the name Mozingo in this book. And there in Virginia, you meet a character, Junior Mozingo. A lot of these people didn't really want to think about having an African ancestor.__EOS__ He didn't want to hear about it at all. I mean, he had lived literally on a spot where Edward Mozingo had lived 300 years before, yet he had this myth that they were Italian and they had gotten here in the 1800s, when in fact, he could trace his lineage straight to Edward. Edward is his seventh great-grandfather.__EOS__ And you handled that in a pretty gingerly way.",0,,567,"  She publishes ""Vindication,"" which becomes an immediate hit... __EOS__  Yes. __EOS__  ...and makes her famous and controversial.  Would you tell us      just a little bit of why she chose ""Vindication"" as a title, ""A      Vindication of the Rights of Women""? __EOS__  Well, before she wrote her ""Vindication of the Rights of      Women,"" she had written an earlier book called ""A Vindication of the      Rights of Men."" And this was a very daring thing for her to do because in      those days, in the late 18th century, there were certain areas that were      considered respectable for women.  Women could write light verses, they      could write children's books, they could write sentimental novels.  But      they could not write history and politics.  And it was at this moment      when she decides to write ""A Vindication of the Rights of Men"" that she      ventures into the male arena.  And she didn't publish that book      immediately with her name.  When it was a success, her name became known. ",0,,568," Thank you. __EOS__ Bye-bye. Here's an interesting comment from Glen in Minden, Nevada. A bit of a correction  Ham radio operators, in addition to having several jargons of our own  QRZ, QSL  had wireless email starting in the mid- to early 1980s. My very first email via ham radio was sent in 1987 or 1988. But again, not in widespread use, in any case. __EOS__ Hi, thank you for taking my call. __EOS__ Sure. ",0,,569,"  Terence, one of the things that I found interesting is when we      first heard the name `Terence Blanchard,' much of what was put in front      of that was this young kid on the scene, this new maestro.  Now it's      being mentioned that your band is young and you're kind of the veteran,      the old guy of this group. How do you feel about that, man?  It obviously      speaks to a great career you've had, though. __EOS__  No, it does, but I'm not digging that at all. __EOS__  Particularly at 43, right? __EOS__  I mean, really.  You know what I mean?  No, but it's      cool.  I mean, it's just--I'm looking at the whole situation feeling very      blessed to have these guys in my band.  You know, it's one of those      things.  I've been in this business enough to see things come and go, and      you start to realize when something like this comes along, when a group      of musicians like this come together to form a unit like this, I'm just      trying to appreciate every moment of it because you know it's not going      to last forever. ",2,,570," And how do you find musicians there? __EOS__ One of - our strategy is to find musicians just to work with organizations such as Schools Without Borders - we also work with an Oakland-based record label called Youth Movement Records, it's also a nonprofit - that are working in certain communities to do music education programs already. So, in a way, they're providing us with a pool of talent that we can select. __EOS__ Tell us a little bit, if you could, about Samuca, who's the lyricist and emcee for the group Movimento Na Rua. __EOS__ The story behind Samuca is that back in the late '80s, early '90s, he was one of the most wanted kidnappers in Rio de Janeiro. He used to hold executives for ransom, and he eventually served time, almost 10 years in jail. While he was in prison, he really had a transformation. He turned his life around from wanting to be the next Pablo Escobar to becoming a social entrepreneur. ",2,,571," You know, he always preferred the sequel. He always preferred the copy. He always preferred, you know, he said that he was a producer, to some people, of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents."" Not the original series from the '60s that we all remember, but some revival of it in the '80s, you know. Strange.__EOS__ So when you found out, you know, that he had kidnapped his daughter and then later you found out he was a murderer and it was a gruesome murder...__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ ...were you angry with him, you know, for having duped you? Because it's not, you know, like if a friend betrays you, you're angry. It's your friend, they betrayed you.",0,,572," Yes, you write about the mega colon there. So you can talk about that.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ That's probably the most relevant thing for your book.__EOS__ Yes. The mega-colon is on display and it's this big glass vitrine with kind of perfectly placed museum lighting. And it's this colon that is as big around as my waist. Literally. And it's a sad thing. The man who had it was a very unhappy man who had a lot of problem, you know, emptying his colon and eventually died from it. But it is a very - it's a strange place because a lot of the exhibits are upsetting.",0,,573,"  The late 1970s was a chaotic time in Jamaica and here's where the film and Perry's life get murky. Political violence exploded. At the Black Ark, Perry was being extorted by gang members, his wife left him and hoards of Rastafarians were camping out in the grounds. The film panders to stereotypes about primitive ganja-smoking Rastas and it seems Perry had a breakdown. __EOS__ He threw everybody out of his studio. He trashed all the equipment and threw a lot of it into the septic tank. But when people spoke to him and said, hey Scratch, what's going on? You know, have you gone mad? What's the -have you taken leave of your senses? He would tell them, no, I'm just pretending to be mad. __EOS__ It's a claim often made by Perry and those around him, including Bill Laswell. __EOS__ Probably he manufactures that just to keep people from messing with him. In Jamaican, there was a saying. I don't remember exactly, but he plays fool to catch wise. And that's pretty much what I think the deal is. ",1,,574," White Mother's love, Black Son's Courage"". Welcome to you all. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ Thank you. ",3,,575," You were an extra in ""Less Than Zero""?__EOS__ Mm-hmm. And I enjoyed it.__EOS__ That must have been fun. I mean...__EOS__ Oh, it was so much fun. I just wanted to be around film. Suddenly, I was on film, and I was on a set and watching how the guys - you know, how they do it.",1,,576, Okay. And this is the scene - if anyone remembers the story - I'm sure a lot of our listeners do - you and Clint Eastwood have this scam going. There's a big price on your head. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ So Clint Eastwood brings you into the law. __EOS__ Right. ,1,,577," One thing about the book that surprised me is you have a lot of detail and stories about the world that he occupied, but it seemed very difficult to get into the head of this character and of this person. Were you able to find out what motivated Titanic Thompson? __EOS__ Well, I did find he was married five times. And unfortunate in this case, he married women who were quite young. So even though he died in 1974, his fifth wife is still with us, wonderful person, with great stories about Titanic. And I think her reading was the closest, that he was always looking for validation. He was a boy who came out of the Ozarks with nothing, entirely self-taught, lived by his wits and his guile. He was proud of that. __EOS__ Kevin Cook is the author of ""Titanic Thompson  The Man Who Bet on Everything."" __EOS__ Thanks so much. Enjoyed it.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0,,578," I wasn't shocked by it. It was a miracle. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ It was black and white and I think ""Kukla, Fran and Ollie"" was the big show of the day, you know? __EOS__ Pretty exciting stuff. It was in California when I went to visit my aunt in California, so... ",1,,579," Yes, yeah. I think it's difficult. You know, I told them, you know, something like that is not going to be happening again, because some situation, you can use it to do something really great, even TV need to have a rock star or something. People - a very popular artist, we can use these opportunities to bring people together. __EOS__ Speaking about the question of engaging with political leaders, there's some interesting news out of Senegal right now. The government has released four journalists who were accused of offending the president, which raised concerns about freedom of expression. Is this ever a concern for you as an artist? Do you ever find yourself having to concern yourself about the content of your music, out of concern about repercussions? __EOS__ Yeah, I think this is very important. People - like in Senegal, is a country of more things happening, because it's a democratical country before all these government are in the place. And yeah, sometimes, something will happen between the freedom and, you know, what the government think about it. I think we still really having vigilance about, you know, what's going to happen. __EOS__ On your latest album, ""Give and Take,"" the first track ""4-4-44."" I'm not sure if I'd call it political. Maybe - what would you call it? Nationalist? Kind of a nationalistダﾝ ",2,,580," Storytelling is - I mean, this is a...__EOS__ And storytelling is what I think I do in the movies.__EOS__ It's what you do. A much younger colleague asked me, gee, I wonder what Fred Wiseman thinks about the pace of movies today. And I had to explain to him his pace was different 30, 40 years ago. You've always been a contrarian about how long we should experience a scene.__EOS__ You know, the scenes in my movies are based on scenes that are probably 15-times longer, certainly some of the meetings. The staff meetings at the National Gallery went on for an hour and a half or two hours. You see seven or eight minutes, and it's not a consecutive seven or eight minutes. It's an edited seven of eight minutes. You know, it's a question of who the audience is. And the only safe assumption I make about an audience is that the people who are going to see the film are as smart or as dumb as I am. I think anything else is condescending.",1,,581," I'm probably most like Brick Tamland in real life. And... __EOS__ ...I do have to say, that was one of the most fun things I ever did. That - shooting ""Anchorman,"" we laughed until we cried every day we shot. There were so many funny people working on that movie. And Brick was just - well, honestly, what I loved about that movie is that it had absolutely no heart and no sentimentality at all. It was purely ridiculous fun - and silly. __EOS__ Yeah, it made it really delightful.  __EOS__ It was fun. It was a lot of fun.  ",1,,582,"  You used your money... __EOS__ Static and air raid sirens. __EOS__ Hello, everybody. This is Wayne. I sing and blow up balloons for the Flaming Lips and this is... __EOS__ I'm Steven from the Flaming Lips and I play assorted instruments. We're all obsessed with any sound we can get our hands on, and so, you just pile a bunch of stuff on and see what sounds cool and what doesn't. ",2,,583," There's also - you mentioned this in passing earlier - the nature-nurture element of this. To what degree to benefit from any of this prescription must we be winners of the genetic lottery? __EOS__ Well, of course, it helps to win the genetic lottery, but biology is not destiny. We've known that for a long time. And there's no question that as we get older, how you've maintained the machinery is much more important than the machinery you were granted in the first place. __EOS__ So a properly maintained Yugo will do just as well as, perhaps, a Mercedes that's been left and neglected? __EOS__ Well, the proof of all of this is these huge studies of men - the Penn and Harvard one, for example - were it makes no difference what genetic background is. If you do a certain amount of exercise, your life span will be increased. Your vibrancy and strength will be increased. And the most important thing - once again - is this is not genetic. This is something you've done for yourself. ",0,,584," Head banging, yeah.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ My visions of that comfy chair have been quashed by that.__EOS__ It's great. That's the scherzo from Bruckner's Ninth Symphony in a new recording by the Berlin Philharmonic and conducted by Simon Rattle. That's one of the picks Tom Huizenga brought in this week. He is, of course, NPR's classical music producer. You can find more of his picks today at the blog Deceptive Cadence. You can find it our website, nprmusic.org. Tom, thanks so much.",2,,585," So, you know, yeah, he wasn't happy about that. But again, that's, I think, a sentiment that a lot of parents may feel about their teenage children. You know, the teenage years can be a bit rocky. __EOS__ I'm curious to know what you make of the sort of veneration of Ronald Reagan. You call it a fetish in the book. And I want to play a clip of some of what that might sound like. __EOS__ Okay. All right. __EOS__ Who was your favorite Republican president? ",0,,586," But did the confession get you out of prison, or was it the international pressure that got you out of prison? __EOS__ No, no. It was the international pressure, definitely. I think my colleagues in Newsweek, in Washington Post Company, in Channel 4 news in the UK, and especially my wife Paola, they campaigned for me tirelessly. And it was just amazing. When I came out, I realized what an amazing job they had done, and I never can thank them enough. But it was the international pressure and it was the comments made by different officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and many other officials around the world who talked about my case in private, sometimes, to the Iranian officials. __EOS__ Your wife gave birth to, I think, your first child... __EOS__ Yes. ",3,,587," It was fun to take a character who really doesn't care about - I mean, you know, his counterpoint to where we see his emotions is in his family - and I have a great cast in the family. You know, Glynn Turnman plays my father, and Donis Leonard Jr. plays my son, and he's one of the real breakout characters on our show. So we have three generations of black men on screen, and that's rarely seen. There's just a lots of dynamics and a lot of fun that gets to be had.__EOS__ Well, talking about going everywhere, you mentioned the character of your son. His acting, of course, stands out, but his character stands out because he is struggling with his gender identity. Maybe he's not struggling with it so much as everybody else is.__EOS__ There you go, I was about to say that.__EOS__ He's kind of OK where he is but...",1,,588," Well, thank you so much. And I just want to thank you publicly too for what you do for the Imagination Library and wish you could talk a little bit about that and how you got the dream to start that wonderful program too.__EOS__ Oh, go ahead, please.__EOS__ Well, that's actually one of my favorite things that I do. I'm known as the Book Lady. The kids all call me that because, as you know, we send books from - to children from the time they're born till they start school. And they get a book a month in their name in the mailbox, so they're kind of, you know, really selfish about their books. They don't want anybody messing with it unless they're going to help them to read. So it's their little property.__EOS__ Michael...",2,,589," And with this movie in particular, with it being an apocalyptic situation, which is...__EOS__ There's so many of these types of movies that like...__EOS__ But it's just we wanted people to relate to it. We didn't want to reinvent the wheel and make something look like something you've never seen. We wanted people to see it and say, like, I know what that means.__EOS__ It's true. Like to us it was almost funny that we had taken this, like, very simple concept that was almost like too familiar and applied this, like, kind of weird, meta, you know, humorous twist on it, you know. So yeah, we watched like ""Dawn of the Dead,"" obviously, I mean the original one and the - I mean, those are movies about like people kind of stuck in places as there's like a force outside kind of trying to get them. Like that was...",1,,590," My guest isダﾝ __EOS__ A lot of it has to do with economics so, you know, we have to play all of that together. __EOS__ My guest is Carlotta Walls LaNier. She's the author of ""A Mighty Long Way  My Journey to Justice at Little Rock Central High School."" __EOS__ Well, I'm - we had busing here in the metropolitan Denver area as well for the same reason, to achieve integration. And I was against, personally, overall for busing, but if that was the way we needed to achieve it, then we must do it. But at the same time, take the time to start putting another plan in place so that you don't have to bus kids from one side of town to the other for them to have diverse classroom activities and to get along with each other, so - or to learn about each other. ",0,,591," You've performed Shakespeare sonnets on stage? __EOS__ Mm, I've had a little show just an hour long with a very, very good cellist called Vincent Segal. And I'd been going around Europe in a beautiful Balenciaga dress, sitting at a table, reading about 21 sonnets and Vincent playing in between. __EOS__ What is the relationship you see between acting and singing? __EOS__ Well, I think they both spark off each other, but they're different. I love acting, and I do use my acting skills in my music. And I'm sure I use my music skills in my acting, but I couldn't really tell you specifically how. ",2,,592," I know I love that because you talk about studying someone's voice as if it's music, and she has such a musical voice.__EOS__ She does, and she has no breath, absolutely none.__EOS__ I was going to say that, exactly. It sounds like she's been running up a hill.__EOS__ She always sounds like that. I feel like that when I'm in the kitchen, don't you? Well, I'm not a very good cook, but...",1,,593," Hi. Thank you for taking my call. __EOS__ I should note the Fort Myers in Florida, not the one in Virginia, which is still a military base. __EOS__ Exactly. And actually, being in the military, I was in the Army as a flute player for the Army. And my husband was an enlisted man who did go to Vietnam. __EOS__ And how did that manifest when he got home? ",0,,594," Hey, Dr. Pape, it's great to see that you're on the show here. Yeah, I read your book ""Dying to Win,"" and reference it a couple times. I've been in the Army for almost 19 years. I have five tours in Iraq, spanning over my 19 years. And I can honestly tell you that one thing that scared the Iraqis was not IEDs or rocket attacks. It was a threat of suicide. __EOS__ As suicide terrorism, is it a tactic or a strategy? I know that's a loaded question. But as a tactic, is it defeatable? The same thing as a strategy, is it defeatable? __EOS__ And when you talk about the - Troy, when you talk about the Beirut attacks, you're talking about the attacks on the U.S. Marine barracks. __EOS__ Yes. Yeah. That's right. ",0,,595," How about farewell or abiento, or until next time?__EOS__ . That's right, . Good.__EOS__ All right.__EOS__ That's a gentle see you later from Renee Montagne to producer Jim Wildman, and, man, are we going to miss him. The National Day of Listening is tomorrow. Hear more interviews and upload your own at NationalDayofListening.org. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",3,,596," Right. Well, one of the things you have to do, or one of the things that I decided to do, was that since these are sister movies and that they really work together in a sense, is that I maintained the same color structure in the second Godfather.__EOS__ It was this yellow, kind of yellow that went - however, the content of the structure of the photography I changed because of this turn-of-the-century feeling and the retrospective footage. And then we went from, you know, 1902 up to 1950-something in Lake Tahoe. So, it was tricky because you had New York, then you had Sicily, which had to be different but still in the same time period.__EOS__ How are we going to know where we are here? Were going from here to there to there to here. I said, look, you know, we get to New York and you say its New York, 19-so-so. When you get to France, say, put it - you know, put a one-liner under it. I said, it's been done for years, its classy, everybody will - and everybody will know where they are and there won't be any problem.__EOS__ What were the streets in New York or the parts of New York that were easiest to transform convincingly to the turn of the century?",1,,597," Somebody called me and told me that Dizzy going to come in the cruise - that was doing a jazz cruise through the Caribbean. It was a group of another important artists, you know, there was Earl ""Fatha"" Hines and Stan Getz, among other great jazz musicians. But my special interest, of course, was to meet my hero Dizzy Gillespie. We never met, but I was listen to him for quite a number of years and I hear a lot of his recordings and I was dying to meet him.__EOS__ Well, let's play a clip from your latest album. This was written for Dizzy Gillespie and the song is called ""Every Day I Think of You.""__EOS__ ""Every Day I Think of You,"" that's the song you wrote for your friend Dizzy Gillespie. Your remained close with him until his death in 1993. What do you miss most about him? Do you miss playing with him? Do you miss just talking with him?__EOS__ I miss everything about him. Everything. Not only his playing, but his company, his warm person, you know. He was a big-hearted person.",2,,598," I took over the bass. And it was Dennis Rodman's New Year's Eve party, and there was a riot afterwards. The band said you did so well...__EOS__ I don't know if there's a question in there, but it's a great story.__EOS__ , we're going to hire you.__EOS__ That sounds like the best night of anyone's life.",0,,599," One of the things that made me quit was I said I'm not going to write any more social commentary. I'm not going to write this. I just went, no. I just got stubborn with myself. No more, because, you know, I took a lot of flack and I just thought that I didn't want to go through the experience. I was mad at America. And I thought, you know, come on. Wake up, you know? like wake them, shake them. But I didn't want to be the one. __EOS__ But ultimately, she couldn't fight what was inside. __EOS__  Strong and wrong you win. Only because that's the way it's always been. Men love war! That's what history's for. History. A mass-murder mystery. His story. Strong and wrong. You lose everything. __EOS__ Joni Mitchell wrote all of the lyrics for the songs on her new recording save one. It's called ""If."" Her musical setting of a poem by Rudyard Kipling. ",2,,600," You have to realize you're not writing for the filmmakers. You're writing for the potential film audience. And I would much rather hurt somebody's feelings who made the picture than send somebody to see a movie and spend two hours of their life seeing a movie that I don't think is worth seeing.__EOS__ Roger Ebert with Gene Siskel in 1996. Ebert died yesterday. Our remembrance continues in the second half of the show. I'm Terry Gross. This is FRESH AIR, and this is NPR.__EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Today we're remembering film critic Roger Ebert. He died yesterday at the age of 70, just a few days after blogging that a painful fracture that had made it difficult to walk was diagnosed as cancer.__EOS__  There they were in a pile - a pile of little arms. And I remember, I, I, I cried. I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget. And then I realized, like I was  shot, like I was shot with a diamond - a diamond bullet right  through my forehead. And I thought  My God, the genius of that. The  genius. The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.  And then I realized they were stronger than we. Because they could stand that these were not monsters. These were men, trained cadres, these men who fought with their hearts, who have families, who  have children, who are filled with love, but they had the strength, the  strength, to do that.",1,,601," And in this article you wrote  From the beginning of organized society, boys have been raised to accept the idea that one day they might be called upon to either kill or be killed, to be ready to defend their home, their villages, their tribes against harm. __EOS__ I've always felt that that is a responsibility that I was born to because I'm male. I mean when I was 10 years old, my father said, you know, men dont sleep as deeply as women because we need to be ready if somebody comes. In my life as I've actually led it, I've always felt that it's up to me to step in if somebody who is sort of in my circle who I, just because of my relationship to them, I am sort of duty-bound to protect it, it is up to me to step in. You know, I have not been in some situation like that Dustin Hoffman character in ""Straw Dogs"" who... __EOS__ I hope not. __EOS__ ...who's there with his little wire-rimmed glasses and his sort of porn-starry-looking wife while all these kind of cretin-ish locals pound on the windows and try to get in, but there have been a couple of instances when I've had to sort of man up, as we say, and step between someone who I feel was mine to protect somehow and someone who was going to do them some harm. ",0,,602," But it's not just South African. There's Kenyan and some other East African rhythms in there as well.  I guess I'm wondering, do musicians from different parts of, you know, such a giant continent - I mean, how did they feel about, you know, a band being here and trying to kind of blend from different places? __EOS__ I think, you know, we don't - I wouldn't say that we blend in any sense willy nilly. It's, you know, all those aspects of ""Upendo"" are regionally consistent.  In fact, generally, you know, we write in a vein so that people can find themselves inside the music. We're not trying to impress anybody or be purists about anything, you know. So far, every musician, every African musician we've played with has given us the thumbs up. __EOS__ Can you guys talk a little bit about the process of composing African music? I mean, you know, rhythm section, is there a repeating element to it, then where do you go from there? __EOS__ I mean, I only know how we do it. So I'm sure it's done differently in different places. But yeah, it usually starts - the process usually begins with a bass line or a guitar line. And then, you know, then the process after that in building the rhythm section generally is finding where the spaces are in that line and filling the space, but not gratuitously, trying to find something that locks in nicely and makes - and kind of answers the other line. And then once you've woven all those things together, there's the horn line over the top of that and the vocals and the interaction between those. And that seems to be pretty much the way it gets built up. ",2,,603," He can do it. We also had, you know, we recorded it all at Abbey Road in London and he had - he has a whole, you know, group of musicians that he's worked with many times there. There was a guy named Paul Clarvis, is his name, who plays every possible kind of percussion. And he plays the Jew's Harp on that track and he just was like a virtuoso Jew's Harp player, with these Mongolians Jew's Harps that he had brought in. __EOS__ Are you kind of exhausted? This film, 卿ｫFantastic Mr. Fox,卿ｫ must have taken so much work because it's so detailed between the puppets and stop-motion photography. __EOS__ Yeah, with a live action movie, your day is one shot after - you have the shots that you want to get done in that day. And you do them consecutively. You finish one, you move quickly on to the next one. And at the end of the day, the sun goes down or something happens - you finish the number of hours, whatever it is that's going to end your day. __EOS__ Right. That must be fulfilling. ",1,,604," Yes. Which makes things rather awkward, I presume, if they want to bring out a new book with them. But it's interesting because Random House, since DA VINCI's success, has brought out, in the UK, a new illustrated version of their book, and they'd be making a lot of money on that. __EOS__ Well, you talk about sales, although it's some time before we actually hear a verdict in this case, for now, at least in terms of sales, it seems that everybody's a winner. All these books are selling. __EOS__ They're soaring. Sales are soaring. THE HOLY BLOOD AND THE HOLY GRAIL in particular, I mean, that's, you know, it was registering before, now its right near the top of the charts. And THE DA VINCI CODE has just pushed past the four million mark here, which is huge. __EOS__ And we should say this is coming out right before the movie is released this summer. ",0,,605," Well, the thing about writing is if you really try, if you do it every day, and you put in your time, you get better. I don't know if there's a - I think with acting that's possible, too, but writing is something that if you really plug away at it, you can get better.__EOS__ A, choose the time that's good for you. For me, it's early morning because I wake up, and I'm fresh, and I sit in my place. I look out the window, and I have coffee, and no one's gotten up yet or called me or hurt my feelings.__EOS__ It's very important that your feelings are very, sort of, just stable. You know, you don't want to have a heartache when you're trying to go fly on some adventure of writing. At any rate, it's very important for the young writer to, when you finish the six, seven, eight pages, to turn them over and don't look at them again, because I believe there is a hormone that is injected in the blood of the young writer that makes him hate everything he has just written.__EOS__ My question has to do with working with actors. It's very intimidating for young filmmakers to think that they can work with some A-list Hollywood actor. They all have their entourage, and they're paid a lot of money. So what's your approach?",1,,606," It's a lot of studying. The teen tournament has a lot of - it does have, you know, your typical literature, art, things like that, but it also has a lot of pop culture, young adult literature, video games, things like that. And I'm on my school's academic team so I know a bit of the, you know, literature, science, things like that. So, I did a lot of studying of young adult literature. My mom kind of drilled me on books that are aimed at teens because that's what the teen tournament likes to ask a lot about.__EOS__ Oh, about literature?__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ How much did you win?",2,,607," Thank you. __EOS__ You write a book about the personal side of Rush Limbaugh. Are your liberal friends still inviting you over for cocktails these days? __EOS__ Yeah, they invite me over, and they're curious about Rush. Most of them don't listen and have never listened to him. And so they're interested, I think, sometimes to know what it is he actually says and how it is that he manages to keep such an incredibly large audience. __EOS__ And I think a lot of people out there do wonder that  What is this guy's appeal? And what would you say to them? I mean, you get into this in the book, but what would tell people who just don't get it? ",0,,608," Say his name.__EOS__ Johnny Michaels, and he was - he bounced around a bit. He was at WNBC and WABC, and he was there at the vanguard when rock 'n' roll was making that switch from AM to FM. He had the most beautiful voice, which, you know, made it even more vexing that he wasn't around because this gorgeous baritone would be coming out of the radio, and I knew that was my father, but I didn't know what he looked like or why he never came around.__EOS__ What did manhood mean to you?__EOS__ Well to me it meant just total mystery and confusion. I mean, it was just me and my mother, and she's a wonderful woman and knows all there is to know about courage and character and grit. But I just felt, as so many young boys, young men do, that there was some secret knowledge that men had and that I wasn't privy to it because there was no man in my house.",0,,609," And the lyrics talk about that initial weariness about, about moving forward. The first line in the song is, New beginnings are so hard to find. __EOS__ Yeah, they're very hard to find, and they are mountains to climb and you have to determine to live when you have been part of another person half of your life, you must decide to live. That's what I counsel people who are going, I've always had a great sense of life and great desire for life and never had any thoughts of taking my own life, that would be a mortal and a great sin. But I've found that you do have to consciously and verbally say, I choose to live, because the grief will pull you into quicksand that you can't get out of. __EOS__  Are you gonna take it, if I give my life to you, are you gonna take it and break it into a million crystals? __EOS__ You know, when I was going over the materials just to prepare to talk to you, I listened to a lot of your older solo work and I listened to the duets with Waylon, and while I thought this album is very much a Jessi Colter record, that your relationship with Waylon is such a big part of you that it really runs through this whole disc.

Thank you so much for joining us.",1,,611," Is that true? Why did she become such a big symbol, then? __EOS__ Well, I think that you stated the reason. I mean, here's this six-foot-tall woman with broad shoulders and big biceps and carrying an ax and smashing hatchets. It's what we would say right now is a good photo op. I mean, she just was really good press. She then went on tour, really on the vaudeville circuit, and became the sideshow that I think she was from the very beginning... __EOS__ Seriously, she went on tour with her ax and... __EOS__ She went on tour with her hatchet, and she handed out hatchet pins wherever she went, and she made a living doing that. There was also another version of the hatchet that used to hang over the bar in almost every saloon in the country in those pre-Prohibition years, and it said on it  All nations welcome except Carrie. ",3,,612," You're still laundering money from law enforcements but if you, in any caseダﾝ __EOS__ Right. Exactly. __EOS__ ダﾝwe're looking at the online gambling industry. Who's doing it and how? Your calls  800-989-8255, e-mail  talk@npr.org. And coming up, why all of this is now a major headache for the United States at the World Trade Organization. __EOS__ This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. ",3,,613," De Larrocha had a remarkable career spanning three quarters of a century, from her concert debut at age five to decades as perhaps the world's leading female pianist, to her final performance just a few years ago. __EOS__ Pianist Alicia de Larrocha. She died last night at the age 86. ",2,,614," Yes. I love when you say that in the book but explain what you mean. __EOS__ Well, you know, I wanted to make sure that I was very sad about this fellow who I really - who really saved my life. You know, he really did save my life. I had gone into therapy after my first bout with cancer because I really hadn't dealt with it, and I was, you know,  I was just barely functional, and he really helped me through that. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ You know what I mean? ",3,,615," I think there's a lot of them.__EOS__ Yeah?__EOS__ Yeah. I think three made it on my record, I guess.__EOS__ Probably four or five on mine. ""Cover Me Up"" was interesting.",2,,616," Yeah, it was just the three of us, and my parents were teenagers. It really - yeah, there was plenty of room. We were in my grandmother's front yard, too. We were right next to the driveway in my grandmother's yard. My first memory of my grandmother, worked in the cafeteria at the high school where I wound up going from kindergarten through twelfth grade, but my first memory is of her coming home after her shift there with those little drop cookies, boiled peanut butter cookies.__EOS__ And were you playing music when you were very young?__EOS__ Yeah, I started that from probably seven, six or seven years old. All the people in the family, my granddad would get us a mandolin when we were really little because he felt like our hands were too small to play guitar yet. So if you made it through the mandolin, you could get a guitar when you were eight or nine years old or maybe 10 years old.__EOS__ What was the first song you learned how to play?",2,,617," Was she in your view, or in the view of many Malawians, was she going to be Joshua, the one who was going to take the country to the Promised Land?__EOS__ The answer is - the question is not answered yet, because I think it's too early. But so far, she's doing quite well. Now, if she keeps up the feat then, you know, we're going to be happy.__EOS__ The record doesn't just deal with political themes. There's often a lot of fun here.__EOS__  The sky could fall down any day. Nothing lasts forever anyway. Long as I got you here with me, we OK, we OK. If by chance all the skies should fall...",2,,618," Sure, of course.__EOS__ And there are some things that are, you know, pretty different in the film compared to the reality, and - like one example is, you know, there's a very thriller aspect of it toward the end. Without giving anything away, there's always something happening that's threatening them every step of the way so that they're going to be discovered.__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ Which isn't to say reality wasn't really terrifying and dramatic, but these, like, split-second escapes and nearly getting - nearly getting discovered and so on didn't happen that way.",1,,619," So, turning it backwards that sophistication tells us what about our human nature. __EOS__ In this example, it says that we don't just record a videotape of physical events around us, but we analyze them in terms of pretty abstract categories. I mean, if salt goes into a shaker, that's - the physicist can describe the trajectory, but the human mind has to categorize it. Categorize it either as a change of position of the salt or a change of state of the container. Same matter moving through space, two very different mindsets. Now, that's something as simple as how you describe putting salt in a shaker. But the ability to frame reality in multiple ways lies at the heart of our political and moral discourse, our poetry and fiction, our scientific descriptions of the world. __EOS__ Huh. Now, let's scroll forward 200 years and as a colony of humans living in lower Earth orbit on a space station, and they're in microgravity so fill the shaker with salt and pour salt into the shaker no longer have that meaning. What wouldダﾝ __EOS__ Yeah. ",0,,620," Well, it's hard to know.__EOS__ You haven't brought the issue up with her?__EOS__ I can't go back in time to suggest it. But if we had entered into a wed lease, we would have picked a very long term - say, 50 years.__EOS__ So how does this get at the problem of high divorce? Just because it's allowing people - I mean, people get married too quickly all the time, right? I mean, we hear all the time about people, especially celebrities, rushing off to Vegas and jumping into a wedding and then giving getting divorced 72 hours later. How does this solve that problem? I mean, if they're not thinking about the wedding that much before they get married, they probably wouldn't take the preparation of signing a wedlease either, right?",3,,621,"  It's odd when I think of the arc of my life - from child to young woman to aging adult. First I was who I was. Then I didn't know who I was. Then I invented someone and became her. Then I began to like what I'd invented. And finally I was what I was again.__EOS__ That's Anna Quindlen, reading from her new book. And would you compare the person you initially was - were...__EOS__ ...with the person that you invented?__EOS__ Oh, Gloria Steinem uses a phrase that I mention in this book, female impersonators. And she talks about how women respond to societal pressure by becoming some carefully manipulated version of themselves. I think I did that for a long time. I was a pretty gutsy, out-there little girl, the kind of little girl who wasn't afraid of a whole lot, who got into some trouble, who shot off her mouth all the time.",3,,622," Ouch. You describe a moment in the book, I'm going to take as definitive - Eliot Ness and the Untouchables put a battering ram on a truck and smashed into a warehouse on South Cicero, in Chicago. I'm wondering if in that moment, Eliot Ness discovered that he enjoyed the excitement, the risk, the thrill of police work in a way that he hadn't understood in kind of more desk-bound duties.__EOS__ Absolutely. It gave him a rush. It gave him a real rush that stuck with him. He had a depressive personality; he had a hard time kind of getting to highs, and he didn't know why. I mean, people then didn't understand depression or what it was. Even when he was, you know, the press was hailing him, he kind of felt like a failure. That was just kind of inherent in him.__EOS__ We'll note he became public safety director in Cleveland when it was a huge and wide-open town. And he brought crime down, didn't he?__EOS__ Oh, he absolutely did. And Ness came in; he was 33 years old, and he had kind of the arrogance of youth and coming out of his success in Chicago. He said right out of the gate he was going to find out which officers were on his team, and which were not; and he was going to get rid of every traitor in the police department, and he was going to go out and investigate it himself. Ness - he helped invent the modern police force.",0,,623," And we don't. We invite everyone to experience this film.__EOS__ Unfortunately, so often, religions, vis-a-vis dogma, separate us. But spirituality unites us in our common humanity, and that is, I think, the major theme of the movie.__EOS__ You're going to let your father have the last word there, Emilio?__EOS__ I think have to...",1,,624," You know  and I know - the sad thing is, I know what they're talking about. I was sitting down by the river one day, enjoying the sunset with my girlfriend, and three guys walked by in suits, and the one guy just looks at me and goes  Someone should knock you out. __EOS__  he was talking about. And they all kind of cracked up. And he's like  I'm right. And I'm like  Yeah, you're right. People really don't like Scott Templeton. It's a lot of fun to play a character like that, and the reaction continues to be fun. __EOS__ Right, right, right. You know, you've done three movies now, and the first two highly acclaimed, and I'm confident the third one is going to be well-received as well. The reviews are good. And you've done three movies. None of the characters are famous or powerful. Nobody's been stabbed, shot or blackmailed. Can you keep this up? __EOS__ I don't know. I don't know. It is funny. I do get that a little bit. I don't know what it is. I definitely am interested in the ordinary becoming extraordinary in some way and trying to find that and challenging myself. ",1,,625," No, he's stone deaf. He can't hear a thing. He went deaf on the radio. I mean, it was a process of some time, but he gradually went deaf. In the last few months of his deafness, he was broadcasting every day. And then he went and got a cochlear implant... __EOS__ That's an implant that let's him hear some things, some voices? __EOS__ Yes. If you sit with him in a quiet room face to face, you can talk with him easily. He almost never talks on the phone. I went out with him one night with him and his girlfriend, now his fiancee, and we sat at a quiet table, but he couldn't hear a thing. __EOS__ You also use the word charming to describe Rush Limbaugh, and I can hear more liberal listeners cringing right now. How do you convince them that that's even possible? ",0,,626," The Tantrik Order was a secret society that Bernard concocted. It was a kind of a blueprint for living. He wanted to establish lodges throughout the United States and around the world, indeed, in which yoga would be taught along with Hindu philosophy. __EOS__ And the order sort of gained a reputation for being a den of immorality, that opium was used there, that you had to have sexual intercourse with another member in front of the group to get in. Was there any truth to any of that? __EOS__ There's no record of truth to the opium charges, and it's not true that you had to have sacramental intercourse to get into the club. However, there is a record that some of this sex, as a part of the tantric ritual, did occur in San Francisco. __EOS__ In 1909, Bernard goes to New York to set up a yoga school there. He very quickly becomes embroiled in scandal that would sort of consume - I guess about a year of his life. What happened? ",3,,627," ...You want to keep something to yourself?__EOS__ I felt like it was something worth sharing, you know, and it made so much sense with the song and where we shot the video and the story of the song. And then, even the fact that the director of the video was the guy that introduced us seven years ago, we couldn't not put it in there. It just was a full-circle moment that just made sense.__EOS__ Do you struggle as an artist between how much to keep to yourself and how much to give away?__EOS__ I think I have a good gut instinct about those things. And I know when things feel a little, like, intrusive and when they don't. But I don't have a lot to hide. So it's not like I have to do it to preserve my reputation. But I do sometimes think, don't share everything.",2,,628," I do think understanding this universal appeal of democratic values, this universal desire for liberty, the fact that people who are denied it and have to fight for it are often fiercer defenders than people who are born to it. __EOS__ It's a question I put to Madeleine Albright a few days earlier. __EOS__ Well, mine in the following way, which is definitely about the importance of the role of the United States. There's no question about that. And definitely a sense of the necessity for a moral foreign policy. And the fact that the United States stands for something that needs to be reflected. __EOS__ The question, of course, is what that something is. His students, who are scattered throughout diplomatic offices around the world, probably think about this question a lot. Condoleezza Rice admits that she still thinks about it herself when dealing with the Iraq question or the war on terrorism. ",3,,629," Nobody wants to hear you were too busy.__EOS__ Nobody wants to hear it 'cause, like, we're all busy. And it was an very important lesson in my life.__EOS__ When did it become an issue? When did your religion become an issue? Almost immediately, right? In the general election?__EOS__ Well, you know, it's funny - as soon as I won the DFL - Democratic Farmer Labor - endorsement, that is when the issue of religion first confronted me in a huge way. But it really wasn't - it didn't start out bad. There was a reporter, her name was Rachel Olson, and she said aren't you, like, a Muslim? I was like, yeah. And she said, well, if you win, will you be the first one? I said I don't know. And everything up until then had been other issues, but then the religious issue really came up. And one day I was just sort of like say, well, why is - why do people care? And the answer was, look, this is like somebody who's of Japanese ancestry being elected to Congress a few years after Pearl Harbor - I mean, it's - people - it's a thing. And you need to confront the fact that people are concerned about it. And I did.",0,,630," Well, I grip my knuckleball in the way that Joe, Phil - Joe Niekro, Phil Niekro and Tim Wakefield grip theirs, and I tutored under Charlie Hough, who was a longtime knuckleballer for the Dodgers and the Rangers, the White Sox and the Florida Marlins.__EOS__ Yeah, have you had particular moments that you enjoyed them flailing away at your - a good knuckleball?__EOS__ Indeed, indeed. I've thrown a few times, a pitch, a knuckleball, to a left-handed hitter in particular where I've thrown the pitch and it had zero spin on it, and they've actually swung the bat, and the ball has broken after they've swung and actually hit them.__EOS__ So they've swung, and it's hit them either on the back of the leg or the back foot. Or one time I hit a guy in the waist, and he swung at the pitch. And when they're swinging at the pitch, and it ends up hitting them, you know you've got some pretty good movement that day.",0,,631," Yes, they're in alphabetical order with the regulators on the other side. So you had the Treasury secretary, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, New York Fed Chairman Tim Geithner, Sheila Bair, the head of the FDIC, facing all of these bankers. And at this very large conference room in Treasury - it's known as the Large Conference Room - they thought the meeting would go for several hours because nobody thought it would be easy to get these guys to sign on, but it went just for an hour. Mr. Paulson was very persuasive. __EOS__ What kind of case did he make? __EOS__ Well, essentially he told them, and Chairman Bernanke did too, the economy is in pretty dire straights, and we need you guys to sign up for this program. We need banks to start lending again. And the only way they're going to do that is that if they have enough capital and they feel like they're comfortable enough to lend money. So we need you guys to step up and take money even if you think you don't need it, because other banks will see what you're doing, the stigma won't be there, and we will be able to restart the financial sector which has sort of been crippled by a credit crunch. __EOS__ The health of the banks varies so much. Some of them really needed this injection of cash. Others didn't really depend on that.  ",3,,632," ""Dukes of Hazzard"" or something you could, you know that, your work is going to be made up of that - episodic television shows. Not that I got many of them, but that was where I - but actually oddly enough though, they were teaching camera terminology at the same time in this acting class, so I actually was able to understand what rack focus and whip pan and all that stuff meant. __EOS__ And when you dropped out of school and you were studying acting, were you living with your mother still or were you on your own? __EOS__ At that time, yeah, I was living with my mom. Yeah, or when I dropped out, and her situation was - she doesn't remember it this way, but basically I just, I had ditched school so long at a certain period in the ninth grade that it was like one of those things where you've ditched so long that you're afraid to go back because the minute you go back you're going to get busted. So you just might as well just stay out until they actually just bust you... __EOS__ So you just might as well just stay out until they actually just bust you... ",1,,633," They were really upset. Tim and Danny, the detectives, were very upset. It didn't strike them as being true or helpful.__EOS__ Right. Now, there was another thing. There was a technical system that the hospital had for dispensing medication, which keeps a record when a nurse has to log in to either - to request and withdraw medication, or to cancel a previous request. And so there is data on which nurses have requested which medications, date and time, right?__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ And when the detectives ask for that data about these nurses in the patients in question, they are told what?",0,,634," Amanuensis, yes. __EOS__ Amanuensis ... __EOS__ Guarantor. __EOS__ But for the most part, he wrote in a very, very different style. And there was a period throughout the '50s when Ellington products and works were released when Ellington had the opportunity to be more effusive or to at least even acknowledge Strayhorn - when the score to ""Paris Blues"" was issued or the score to ""Anatomy of a Murder"" or the score to ""Beggar's Holiday"" - when he was kind of circumspect about the truth. ",2,,635," Exactly.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ The emotions and also the final result. Another thing is how to get there. Once you know exactly what the final result should be and why, then you are ready for the other phase. First, you have other people working with you, of course - this is a collaboration work, that help you to get to those places. And you learn little by little in the way. I mean, you don't start doing Harry Potter. You first do certain small effects, you start to understand the nature of that and once you understand this philosophy, then it just becomes more complex but very similar. Once you understand the principle, then you can go farther pretty easily.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, you're listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News.

And I said, that's what was required. And he said, no. You only have to have one of them, including Prokofiev sonata. __EOS__ Hmm. __EOS__ So I offered to withdraw. __EOS__ For those of us who've never been to an international music competition, is this the equivalent of the recurrent dream some of us have that we show up for the big test and we aren't wearing our pants?

There's several Hank Williams songs that are used, the great country singer.__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ And it's such a great contrast. I think it's perfect in its own way.

You know, right before going to college, you organized a site called Islam Way that you describe as a kind of audio YouTube, where only you and a couple of others could upload things but was a place where Muslims, you know, around the world could network.",0,,656," That chapter is called ""Child of a Broken Home,"" and you're basically having another horrible lunch with your parents, who decided to divorce several months ago. You ask them for the money, and that immediately makes them start a fight over who ruined you more. And the mother accuses the father of constantly rescuing you, and that's why you've amounted to nothing at 33. The father says he's just trying to, you know, help you out, and make a better life for you than he made for himself, and in the end, the dad gives you the money. __EOS__ I want to ask you about the title of the book.

With a run at Feinstein's at Loews Regency in New York City, she'll be giving classic standards a new twist, performing hits made famous by jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald. __EOS__ I didn't even know I could - I didn't even know I had a talent, and it was my piano teacher, at the age of 12, who brought it out, who discovered that I had a voice, and it was merely by accident. You know, every year we'd have a piano recital, and in preparation for the forthcoming recital, Mrs. Johnston said Freda, I want to hear your voice.

T-Bone Burnett, welcome back to FRESH AIR. ",2,,662," Yeah, let me look for that.__EOS__ There's also a complicated dynamic, and that is between Helen and Helen's slave. It's a woman named Moll who was given to her as a childhood companion, and their relationship is never, ever smooth, right?__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ I mean, I think sometimes people try to romanticize this idea that there could be a slave child who's raised alongside the child of the household and that that relationship is fundamentally like siblings. You take it in a different direction.",0,,663," So the M-16 was rushed into production because it was needed for the Vietnam War? __EOS__ The M-16 was rushed into production because first McNamara and then General Westmoreland understood that the United States military was outmatched on the ground, rifle for rifle, with what the Viet Cong and the NVA were carrying, and so this was hurried out of its prototype phase, rushed into production and handed out to troops overseas with very little training. And it was really an incomplete understanding of how the weapon worked. __EOS__ What were the problems the soldiers in Vietnam had with the M-16s? __EOS__ Well, there were several different types of problems that all came together in the same phenomena, which is that the rifle would stop to work - it would jam. And there was a particular species of jam that was really the biggest problem of all. And you know, its one thing to say my rifle jammed, you know, which mean, what does it mean? It means it stops firing. It means that youve got a magazine inserted and you think youre firing on automatic and it just stops, right? Click, it's over, and you have to get the thing to work again.

A little bit later, you kind of drug him and knock him out and then drill into his skull. __EOS__ It's creepy. You know, I'm sitting here talking about it now, and it's, like, wow. That's really dark, man. __EOS__ Yes. What did you do to get into the frame of mind for that, because it's not like it's a zombie movie, like it's a sci-fi zombie movie. This is like the real thing. Jeffrey Dahmer really did this kind of stuff. __EOS__ Yes, yes. A lot of things that happen in the movie really happened, and you know, I had to approach that from a very sort of human thing. I couldn't just him by what he did. I had to understand again, what fuels a human being to go to these lengths to do these things. And once again, us getting into abandonment issues and having his father not be around and not be able to  a terrible communicator, being a young, gay man - at 14, he realizes, and he's just  yeah.

We hear their everyday stories, and every week, we find out how amazing many of those stories are. Today, a story from Jim McFarland. __EOS__ My grandmother used to take my brother and myself to the South every summer. __EOS__ Jim McFarland grew up in New York. He had relatives in South Carolina, and he was taken to see them regularly in the late 1940s and early '50s. __EOS__ When we rode the train coming down from New York, when we got to D.C., we would out of an integrated car. And I thought this was the greatest thing that could ever happen, because now I'm in a car with all my people. And They've got the brown paper bags with the greasy chicken and the sandwiches, and we're having a good time. ",3,,666," Oh, heck, no. I'm  - like I say, I'm claustrophobic. And, you know, I was trying to do anything I can to get out of the mines. That was one thing that I have great appreciation for, but it's not something I could do. __EOS__ All right. __EOS__ I know that as a matter of fact. __EOS__ Well, the miners and their families - I hope they're in all of our thoughts. Thanks very much for the call, Cody.

You get there, then what?__EOS__ I get there with - you know, like the cliche goes, with my beat-up Datsun, and I had $275 to my savings, and I landed in Burbank. And I got the paper, and I found some extra agencies. And by, you know, the end of that week, I was - I paid my 25 bucks to join up, and I was an extra.__EOS__ In what?__EOS__ It started out industrial films and commercials, and then, you know, you work your way up. And I guess the biggest film I had was - I had, that's really, that's a funny way to put it - but was ""Less Than Zero.""",1,,669," In the United States, the definition is an idea of absolute poverty. And what that means is we're looking at how much money you need to support a particular standard of living, to buy a certain number of calories, a certain amount of vitamins, to buy a certain standard of housing.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ And how much does that cost? And somewhat controversially, that is based on a basket of goods that was worked out by a researcher called Mollie Orshansky over 50 years ago, and while the prices have been tweaked, what's in that basket of goods hasn't been tweaked at all.__EOS__ It's things like potatoes, right? I mean, how many potatoes you can afford to buy.",0,,670,"  We need you?__EOS__  Yes.__EOS__ Well, what about you?__EOS__  Well, what about you?",1,,671," By the time I decided to make the film, which was after the world came to the edge of collapse in September, 2008, by that time I already realized that there had been a fair amount of bad behavior in the financial industry. So I thought that I was prepared. It turned out, however, that I wasn't. I had grossly underestimated the level of extraordinarily unethical and even fraudulent behavior that had occurred on such a large scale and was really quite shocked when I found it. __EOS__ Interesting to me that you say you were shocked because this is well-trampled ground by now in books and in magazine articles and on this radio program about just what led up to the meltdown. What were the revelations for you? __EOS__ I started doing research for the film in the fall of 2008, and when we were already filming, in the middle of 2009, the world first learned, and we were among the first to learn, actually, that not only had the investment banks been creating and selling securities that they frequently knew were defective and likely to go bad, but they had been in fact designing them to go bad so that they could profit by betting against them. __EOS__ You include a scene from a Senate hearing, where Senator Carl Levin is interrogating some of the top executives of Goldman Sachs about, well, is this ethical? Do you have a problem with this? ",1,,672,"  ...new, ironed dresses, and hot baths, and sleeping, and waking up. Oh Earth, you're too wonderful for anybody to realize you.__EOS__ Where do you think this speech comes from?__EOS__ I think it comes from deep within Thornton Wilder's heart and spirit. It brings to mind conversations I've had recently with so many people who are in the play, people who saw the play, people that directed the play. But two actors, in particular, who are in their wonderfully mature years have said to me they never fully comprehended Emily's words until now in their 70s and in their 80s. The play has brought them to tears in ways it didn't when they were 20, or 40 or 60 years younger. Reminds us - it's something I've certainly taken to heart since I've had the privilege of working on this biography - that is, as Emily says, every everyday matters; every moment. And Thornton was so concerned about just the value of every moment, of the most ordinary part of the most ordinary day, to look at the now and look at each other - really look at each other - how wonderful that Thornton and Emily remind us about those opportunities.__EOS__ Penelope Niven. Her new book is ""Thornton Wilder  A Life,"" with a foreword by Edward Albee. She joined us from the studios of WFDD in Winston-Salem. Thank you so much.",0,,673,"  Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in. __EOS__  I'm Robert Dunder. __EOS__  I'm Robert Mifflin. Ah, okay. __EOS__  Robert Mifflin had a great life, but unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and it's very treatable. For $250, how did he kill himself? A  a rope, B  a knife, C  a gun, D  brushing his teeth. ",1,,674," No. No, he's way too far on the other side of choir. So he wouldn't even see it, maybe.__EOS__ But that does say something about the relaxing quality that he's describing. You know, that we take all our cares to God, we say in our prayers, in our chanting even. But also, we entrust them to God.__EOS__ Some of these harmonies are very intricate. I imagine you have to be listening quite carefully to your neighbor, the monk standing next to you to make sure you're matching breath and cadence and tone.__EOS__ One of the things where chant mirrors life is that you learn how to breathe as a unit. You don't dare all breathe at the same time 'cause you would break the flow of the chant. And so you may feel you need a breath but you hear your brother is starting to take a breath, so you have to hold on just a little bit longer.",2,,675,"  Right, this is how Michael Caine speaks. Michael Caine speaks through his nose like that. He gets very, very specific. It's very like that. When he gets loudly, it gets very loud indeed. It gets very specific. It's not quite nasal enough the way you're doing it, all right? __EOS__ And that's my guest, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, doing a Michael Caine-off in their new film ""The Trip."" That's an example of the film where the two of you get testy with each other and entertain us in the process. __EOS__ No, he's not quite - no, he's not. I mean, he can do them, and he does do them, and he is - to be truthful, his real character, how he is in reality, he's a bit more on or more so than I am in terms of being entertaining, if you like. __EOS__ Yeah. And do you pepper your own conversation with this? Do you ever lapse into a James Bond? ",1,,676," If you're just joining us, my guest is Carole King, and her new memoir is called ""A Natural Woman."" You did some great demos, and in fact a bunch of your demos are being released very shortly, and it's fascinating to hear the demos that you made for other artists because when you and Gerry Goffin were writing together, you were writing for other performers, and you'd have to kind of - you describe in this book, like you'd channel their voices in your mind and write a song that seemed suitable for them, and then you'd do the demo.__EOS__ I probably started with the piano and then overdubbed my voice if I overdubbed at all, which I usually do. So, yeah.__EOS__ But it sounds like there's two piano parts, one overdubbed on the other.__EOS__ Oh, yes. Again, yes, if that's the case. I haven't actually listened to it for years, and it was just hard for me to go through that whole process, probably for the same reason I'm not comfortable singing a record that I made when I was 15.",0,,677," We do not feel we can take responsibility of appearing to favor or encourage those unfortunate habits. And that is why we shall not be playing the recording in any of our programs, radio or television.__EOS__ Oh, please.

But a second reason did have to do with my work. I'm a law professor at Harvard law school. And over the past - I've been there 24 years now - and over the past two decades, I've, over and over, seen black law students weighed down by an angst or sometimes a guilt regarding their elite status, regarding their success, instead of feeling good about what they're doing as newly minted lawyers. I've come into contact with many black law students who feel burdened, who feel guilty. I think that this worry about, you know, giving back, paying back, has become actually dysfunctional. There are lots of different ways of contributing to the world, and I think people ought to not worry so much about that collective burden, but should seek to maximize their individual talents. And I think if they do that and they're decent people, things will pan out in the end. __EOS__ Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy is the author of ""Sellout  The Politics of Racial Betrayal."" His book came out yesterday, and he joined us from member station WBUR in Boston. __EOS__ Thanks so much for having me on. __EOS__ And that's our program for today. I'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. ",0,,680," He's decommissioning words because you know, if you think, as Mel Armaise said that it's the poet's or the writer's responsibility to sort of purify the language of the tribe or renew the language of the tribe. That's what I thought Frank was doing. He's just throwing out all these words that people are constantly using that are fending. Words like siblings or interface or - oh, God, I can't think of what they are. I keep a list, but it keeps getting bigger and bigger all the time. So that's one thing he does and he also begins to decommission some of his friends who he decides are also not contributing enough to his life and that he doesn't feel he's contributing to theirs. So those are things that I - I mean, I made these things up Terry, you know? I mean, I don't know that everybody does these things. I put them in the book because they seemed plausible and I also think thought they seemed funny, but also in a way useful, too. I mean wouldn't it be better if there were lots of words in our lives that we didn't have to use anymore? And so I just had him start throwing them out, which I think is funny and also useful.__EOS__ Some more words that your character throws out are bonding, mentee - as in mentor - no problem, F-bomb.__EOS__ Yeah, yeah. They're all there. We hear them in the media which is of course, you know, the public riot and corrupting of our souls, but yeah we hear them all the time - words which don't get intellected, words which pass out of our mouths without there being a censor, without there being a grid. They just - bluh, bluh, bluh - stuff that pours out of our mouth.__EOS__ Richard Ford will be back in the second half of the show. His new book is called ""Let Me Be Frank With You.""",0,,681," So this was your alternate family?__EOS__ This is my alternate family, and we really did. I had a fantasy that we were going to start a checking account for a fund that we would all buy a house together. This was my fantasy. And it never happened. We never started a fund for a house together. But, I don't know, I guess I've always felt like if there's a way to live as a family with your friends, that that would be the good thing to do. But I don't think anybody else feels that way.__EOS__ Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach will be back in the second half of the show. They co-wrote the new film ""Frances Ha."" Gerwig is the star. Baumbach directed it. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. They co-wrote the new film ""Frances Ha.""

I mean, I - you know, some of these podcast I did, that was a while ago, you know, and there was an emotional intensity to that thing that's - it's heavy, man.__EOS__ It's real. It just sounds absolutely real.",3,,683,"  Right. __EOS__  So what are the big issues you want to illuminate? __EOS__  When these conflicts start, there's a reason.  But after a      while, nobody knows why people are fighting.  They militias start by      being on one side, and then they become autonomous, and they don't know      why they're fighting anymore, except for the loot, for the power.  What I      do not understand in this thing is how--the level of cruelty those people      can inflict upon each other.  Out of the kids I know, I used to see every      morning, some of them going to school--how all of a sudden they can be so      violent.  And this is where the mystery--this is a puzzle to me. __EOS__  How much did you draw on your own experiences and perhaps those      of your students? ",0,,684," Oh, my god. So the idea of using, you know, visual effects, whether they be makeup effects or now, you know, CG effects, to convey an emotional story was something that was really important to me. And ""Super 8,"" you know, while, you know, obviously like anything its like there are, you know, there are, its imperfect and there are things that dont work, you know, here and there as well as I would have like and all but, you know, you always look back and think oh, I wish this, I wish that. But the thing that I'm the most, you know, sort of - it was most important to me at least going in, the ambition, was to create something that had, yes, it had a creature. But more important to me was that it was something that had feeling and had heart. __EOS__ And you mentioned the creature and the creature is seen as like very monstrous and it is very destructive, but it's also misunderstood and like in The Hunchback of Notre Dame, once you know what the story is, you have empathy for it. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. Yes. __EOS__ So can we talk little about without giving away too much... ",1,,685," Hi there.__EOS__ And let's start with what we commonly describe as this weak recovery or these tough economic times, this stubbornly high unemployment rate. What makes all of this a depression?__EOS__ The reason I use depression in the title is that it's qualitatively similar to the Great Depression. I mean, the Great Depression, the period we call the Great Depression included two recessions and two periods of recovery, but throughout, unemployment was high. The economy was clearly operating below capacity. A lot of ongoing human suffering even when the economy was growing. And that describes what's going on right now too.__EOS__ You argue that policymakers in the 1930s had an excuse for fumbling their way out of the Great Depression because there was no track record of successful economic policies. But today, you say we know what worked. Of course, your critics say the Democrats tried the same thing that worked in the '30s - a stimulus package that was out of the Keynesian playbook - and it didn't work or it didn't work well enough.",0,,686," Yes.__EOS__ You're taking the hitter out of his focus and reaction to what you're doing.__EOS__ Exactly.__EOS__ Now, you say that a pitcher can have bad posture which will indicate that he's frustrated.

But I don't give - we don't give money to research. But it's - if this is the case, then it is certainly worth looking into it. And I'm sure people who are in Washington this week who are physicists, scientists, doctors, are looking at this very, very closely because this is an extraordinary case of someone who had the virus for five years, had a bone marrow transplant, and then it went.",0,,688," Maggie... __EOS__ I think - go ahead. __EOS__ I was just going to say - thank Maggie very much for her call, because I wanted to ask you before we run out of time for the break, there was an encounter with one woman, sort of a battle over a handicapped parking spot, which was really not a problem with somebody trying to be too nice. __EOS__ No, that was a strange encounter. That was a woman who for reasons I can't explain decided that she was going to park in a handicapped spot, and she wasn't, you know, handicapped, and she wasn't going to leave. And she was so threatening to me that I tried to avoid her. When I finally found a handicap spot, I tried to get way down in my wheelchair, you know, and try to sneak between cars because this woman was pretty ferocious.

I just really love them and I love singing them.",1,,691," If we were going to be putting in an Elliot Smith song to end this interview with, what would you pick as your favorite or one you feel like hearing on a weekday morning? __EOS__ Well I - maybe we should play ""Say Yes"" since I was talking about that. You know, there's so many that I love. I really, really love that song. __EOS__  You tell me the morning after. Crooked spin can't come to rest. I'm damaged bad at best. She'll decide what she wants. I'll probably be the last to know. No one says until it shows and you see how it is. They want you or they don't say yes. I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who's still around the morning after. __EOS__ Ali, you were talking about when Elliot Smith was nominated for an Oscar because he wrote a song for ""Goodwill Hunting.""

",2,,693," My goal is to put them all into a Google Earth file so that people can then download it to their computers, use Google Earth and actually pan around the country to see what the snow looked like throughout the country today. __EOS__ Has this ever happened before, do you know, all 50 states have snow on the ground on the same day? __EOS__ I haven't been able to confirm or deny it at this point. I'm hearing anecdotal evidence from people who are emailing me saying that they heard reports back in the winter of '76-'77 that it might have occurred then. But I have not been able to confirm either way. __EOS__ Well, it's a pretty cool thing. ",3,,694,"  You have Ludwig van Beethoven and...__EOS__ ""Screaming Issue"" was written by my dad and my Aunt Terry; written, I think, New Year's Eve, right after I'd been born. I was born Dec. 16. And I was just a horrible baby that screamed constantly - for a while - and so that they were up with a screaming baby, and they wrote that song.__EOS__ But it turned into this lovely, beautiful, beautiful lullaby.__EOS__ It is a really beautiful song. It is. As a kid, I really didn't like it because people would always sing it to me. Like, once I had a math teacher that would sing it to me and point out that each of the notes in the song had the same length, and he thought that was really interesting.",2,,695,"  Dad did it before. __EOS__  So you used the blowtorch. Look at this. We can't live here anymore. __EOS__  So what, it's just . __EOS__  No, this was our house. ",1,,696," Yeah. That's one of the first things I wondered because in the film, I mean the alien, it totally works. You totally believe he's in the RV with them and everywhere and I'm sitting there thinking how do you act if this is blank space? __EOS__ You know, I went back and looked at ""ET."" Obviously, I studied a lot of Spielberg films and other sci-fi films from the period because they're referenced throughout the movie. So I was watching ""ET"" and I was thinking well, you know, a big part of what sells this are the performances of those kids. You know, Drew Barrymore really makes you think she's meeting an alien for the first time. The creature design is amazing in ""ET"" but, you know, I knew the actors had to sell it. __EOS__ Yeah. I'm picturing you doing this job of directing and, you know, and directing it's an artistic endeavor, but it's also this huge management thing, because you have production schedules and big crews and budgets and all that. And so you've got this, you know, you've got this pre-recorded lines of Seth Rogen. You're trying to simulate with this computer-generated guy is going to look like on the set, manage all the other actors, not to mention the fact that this movie also includes bar fights, explosions, car crashes. Gosh. That's a lot to manage isn't it? __EOS__ Well, and it was done on a budget. There are comedies where people are just sitting around a restaurant, talking, that have bigger budgets than this film. You know, they were places where the limitations were frustrating for sure. For instance, we had action scenes, car chases and explosions and we had no second unit which, you know, for the listener, most action films tend to have a second unit where a stunt coordinator is off simultaneously shooting the action bits so the main production can be focusing on acting and so forth. We just had to kind of work it into our schedule and cram it in somehow. And I guess the fun part of that is I got to run around in the little car that goes super fast and has a camera strapped to it, although I feared for my life a few times.

It seems that people of a certain age, you know, young people, especially young men, usually come across the Beats. And me and my friends, I and my friends certainly did, and so... __EOS__ What did it mean to you when you read them? __EOS__ Well, it's funny. I'm actually in a class right now at Yale where we're - it's about the Beats and about, it's about literary coteries. So, its about the Beats and about McSweeney's and Dave Eggers.

Was finishing this book      a bit like finishing a marathon? __EOS__  It was like--well, it was like--finishing this book was      like finishing the marathon, and finishing the marathon was like      finishing the marathon.  That's all I wanted to do, is to see if I can do      it.  You know, it was a challenge.  I'm a big guy; I'm in my 50s.  And,      you know, there was no logical reason for me to do this.  I was in LA--I      was in a Ben & Jerry's, of all places--and saw sign that said, `You, too,      can run a marathon.'  And, like I said, I was in this rut and I went,      `Gee, I need a goal.  I wonder if I can do this?'  So I joined a running      group.  And my goal was just to finish the marathon without my face being      totally blue, you know, and me on my back, you know?

And they talked about people who are in the zone losing consciousness of time and that - or if you're - I mean, we've probably all been stuck with a computer problem, and you looked, and suddenly four hours have gone by while you're trying to solve it.__EOS__ Yeah, but the problem is with writing, if time goes by quickly, and you don't like what you've written in that time, you feel like you've lost something. Maybe that doesn't happen to you.__EOS__ Well, you know, I don't write unless I'm ready. So usually I find if you're in the zone, you usually like what you've written. And if I'm not in the zone, I generally don't write, I will edit at that point, using the - what we call the monkey mind.__EOS__ What do you mean?",3,,707," And would he play more than one opponent at a time? __EOS__ Yeah, there's footage in the film - people always remark on it because it looks to those of us outside the chess world so remarkable, but to people in the chess world, it was quite a normal scene, where Bobby would play 20 opponents at once, going from board to board, making a move while the other people, you know, sometimes four times his age, would still be pondering the move. He would be back after having played, you know, 19 other people. __EOS__ He would rotate around a circle where there are boards of other people, and he would look at the board for two seconds, make a move and just keep moving. __EOS__ Right, so ostensibly keeping all of those patterns in his head, you know, of each board and sort of the state of play.

I mean, it could easily be a teacher. But that is the secret to artistic unity, I think, even when painting a picture or composing a piece of music, is to do it with one person in mind. I don't think you can open the window and make love to the whole world.__EOS__ It's kind of hard to believe now, but Kurt Vonnegut's early work was critically dismissed. His writing was seen as lowbrow, even a little outre. His novel ""Cat's Cradle,"" from 1963, was the first to earn him respect from the literary establishment. And like all of Vonnegut's books, it's still in print and it's still being read.

I mean, you know, getting the visualization of the moment, getting that right. Thats always my concern. __EOS__ What does getting it right mean in this situation, where a guy is kind of waking up out of a dream, senses somethings wrong, and then realizes this absolutely horrible thing has happened, this absolutely horrible thing is happening in his bed and hes just like screaming? __EOS__ Well, from my point of view, getting it right means seeing it at the level that you should see it from an audience point of view.

So Emmylou Harris, you recorded a couple of sessions together and before they were even released, Gram Parsons died of an overdose.__EOS__ I should have, you know. When I came onto the scene with Gram, he was trying to kick drugs and he was drinking a lot. And I was a bit naﾇve about all that stuff and a bit in a cloud, I guess, in a way.

He said you want to - you want to do something with the Mick? Tell him, tell him. __EOS__ So I said okay. Archie Bunker, he's a bigoted guy. He calls them heebs and spics and spades. And Rooney said they are going to kill you in the streets. You can't do that. He said you want to do a show with the Mick? Listen to this.

You really do. __EOS__ Thank you. ",2,,718," Right. So dramatic events, and there was the need for an investigation. The FBI would seem to be the logical entity, but actually killing a president then was not a federal crime; murder is a state crime. How did we end up with a presidential commission looking into this?__EOS__ Well, initially the decision by President Johnson, who was obviously thrust into office at this point, was not to have a federal investigation, was to leave this to the city and county and state officials in Texas to deal with. He didn't want, as he put it, carpetbaggers going into his home state of Texas to run this investigation.__EOS__ Right, and there are six other members appointed, members of Congress in some cases, you know, established people. They hire a bunch of young lawyers, well, young and not so young lawyers to conduct the investigation. And so eventually they do a lot of their own interviews and investigation, reviews of the evidence, and then the commission members themselves in some cases interview witnesses.__EOS__ Very early on, I mean within 48 hours of the assassination, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover determines in his own mind that Oswald acted alone, there was no conspiracy, there's really not much to investigate here. And the FBI, within two weeks, produces this 400-page report, which is supposedly a thorough review of all that is known about the assassination and about Oswald.",0,,719," That was a little small town, around 750 people.

That's where you were for Thanksgiving. __EOS__ Yes, that was number two. It's a much bigger town than back in Minnesota. It's around - I don't know - 9,000 people. And we were very excited to be there on Thanksgiving. And one family was the host. And we spend the dinner time there in typical American family and have a wonderful time. I was watching on a TV, on movies, how it looks like. And finally I just experienced it here, in America, and that was a big thing. __EOS__ Ah-ah.

And, actually, one of the things - especially if you study the Old Testament - one of the things that it gives you is freedom to criticize your religious tradition.__EOS__ Why does it give you that freedom?__EOS__ Because I've been - one of the classes I'm teaching at the moment, we're going through the prophets. And, you know, the prophets criticize the temple and the king and the use of tradition, and just about everything else in sight. And they do so with a vehemence that the Vatican has never dreamt of.

The honest thing is I would like people to think that I got where I am because of the body of my work. I mean, being fine really has nothing to do with me. It's just the luck of the draw, where the universe or the creator happened to put me with two different people and whatever, however the DNA came together. __EOS__ You know I'm just playing with you. __EOS__ I know you are. I know. I know. I get it. But I think that a lot of people in this business rely on that. Like, I'll see someone because they look a certain way or what have you, it's kind of frustrating to people who really want to do good journalism and who are not, you know, as fine or as pretty as a lot of people. And I think that - I think we need to get over that. A good journalist is a good journalist. But, you know, I'll take it. I'll take the compliment. And you ain't bad yourself, either. __EOS__ Oh, well, thank you. So nice. ",0,,726," That's very true. You find yourself alone many times in time of crises. Yes. __EOS__ It's true. It's true. But, you know, I don't want to leave the audience with the impression that this is a bleak album, 'cause there's just too much more to listen to. __EOS__ I notice that you all do a Lennon and McCartney song on this album. __EOS__ Yeah.

So I think Chris was very sensitive, which is what he had to be. __EOS__ So you were elated, and then you had to be, you know, get the tragic news and respond to that. ",1,,729," Yes.__EOS__ And, you know, it's sometimes obnoxious, but it's sort of - I find it quite endearing sometimes. In someone of such manifest intelligence, so obviously gifted, that to see someone behaving in such a plainly childish fashion I find rather endearing.__EOS__ So you've spent the better part of the last eight years playing someone in constant physical pain, and the pain has affected how you walk, with a limp and a cane. It's affected your personality, which is just kind of bitter, cynical, grudging, resentful. So let's talk about that for a moment. Did you feel like you needed to really understand the exact nature of House's injury, know exactly what movements would increase the pain and exactly how severe the pain was in order to play it?__EOS__ I did the best that I could. I think pain is a very - it's an extremely hard thing to empathize moment to moment. And you often don't remember your own pain, you know, that moment that you broke a limb or you burned yourself or, I think, this is a common thing that women talk about with childbirth, that the memory of the pain is hard to summon up and relive, thankfully.",3,,730," And so just seeing that - and then also just convincing people that it's actually a viable business plan and model.

That's the year when they realized the contracts - the first contracts for farm workers in California because of his great leadership and activism.__EOS__ In the book, you write about the fact that we should step away from what you call, quote, ""a narrow light of celebration"" and see Chavez more as a tragic hero. What do you mean?__EOS__ Well, they had set some lofty goals for themselves. They wanted to achieve 100,000 members in California by the end of 1977 and eventually become a national farm worker union and they were well on their way. In 1975, they achieved what was regarded as the best labor law in the United States. It was the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, which allowed for elections to happen and for farm workers to get representation.__EOS__ You know, you've been working on this book, researching for 10 years.

We're talking about the return of Congress after the midterm elections. We're talking about the lame duck session that's just in front of -we're also looking ahead to the Congressmen who come in in January and asking whether if one kind of affects the other. I'm speaking with NPR's Corey Dade, Republican strategist Ron Christie. He was a former aide in the George W. Bush White House, and Matt Kibbe of FreedomWorks. __EOS__ Well, that's an interesting case because Jeb Hensarling is every bit as fiscally conservative as Michele Bachmann is. So it probably wasn't a good test of the so-called Tea Party legislator versus an establishing one. Jeb Hensarling was one of the very first Republicans to step up against the George W. Bush administration's Wall Street bailout. So he had his own street cred with Tea Partiers and I think it was kind of a win-win for our agenda in that particular race. __EOS__ And I get - I take your point in that. But there are some people who look at that and say, but that's an example of why some people in the Tea Party don't get it. They're inexperienced - why would she pursue that position anyway when Jeb Hensarling was, as you put it, right on the issues that she cared about the most. So, why take him on? Why even have that fight? And there are some people who would look at that as an example of why this group might not be as effective as they'd like to be, because they don't get it. __EOS__ Well, you know, we say again and again that the Tea Party doesn't have any leaders and we don't necessarily have designated leaders in the Congress and we don't have designated leaders outside the concert. It's the issues and the agenda and making progress on that agenda. And that's always an open question because I would hope that all congressmen embrace that agenda.

But the - as you look at the future of that part of Europe, indeed, Robert Kaplan, you say middle Europe, this idea that existed - well, sort of an ephemeral idea, but nevertheless - we need to make it less-than-ephemeral. We need to put it into practice.__EOS__ Yes. I start the book in my first chapter about the term Central Europe, or Mitteleuropa, which was rediscovered or re-energized, I would say, by intellectuals in the latter part of the Cold War, around the mid-1980s. In other words, the Cold War threw up two geographical concepts  Western Europe and Eastern Europe, with Germany divided in the middle, with all of that to the east being these gray, boring, repressed satellite states.",0,,745," Lackland Air Force Base?__EOS__ Right. At Lackland Air Force Base. Dozens of the recruits were sexually assaulted by trainers there. And unfortunately, not very many of the trainers who have been involved have been sentenced yet and the ones that have, many of their sentences have been - they seem a little light, you might say. Now recently, there's this case in Italy where an Air Force lieutenant colonel was convicted of aggravated sexual assault and sentenced to a year in jail.__EOS__ So he vacates the conviction and restores him and reassigns him.__EOS__ Right.",3,,746,"  Another lesson, though, is if you measured the date of the end of      the Peloponnesian War a little bit differently, well, not too many years      after that humiliation you talk about, Athens had its long walls, its      navy and its democracy back. __EOS__  That's a very good point, because there were lots of      historians that didn't really know of this Thucydidean concept of the      27-year-old Peloponnesian War.  They thought there was a Deccalean      War, an Ionian War. Some said it didn't end at 395.  Sort of like      World War I.  People said, well, the war started in 1914.  Maybe it      didn't end till '45.  Or maybe in our own experience we've had, in some      ways, four Gulf Wars.  We had the first one to get rid of Saddam out of      Kuwait and then we had the no-fly zones and we had the three-week war,      now this insurrection.  So it's incumbent upon historians to try to      create this period that they call a war and Thucydides was the first one      that saw it as a 27-year continuum, and I think that's why it made him so      different than his contemporaries. __EOS__  And one thing you also point out--I'm afraid we just have a few      seconds left--is that even after Athens recovered all of those trappings      of its independence, it wasn't the same. __EOS__  It wasn't the same because psychologically it had been      wounded. Too many things had gone on.  There'd been kids, just like in      Beslan, Russia, they'd been killed in schoolhouses.  There had been      diplomats that were kidnapped.  There had been targeted assassinations.      There had been terrorism. And there'd been this terrible plague that      killed a fourth of the population. They just couldn't recover      psychologically from all that. ",0,,747," Oh, that's very kind of you to say, Linda. Look, my grandparents were illiterate. The descriptions of Cleveland, that little town which I described in that first reading, that's where my grandparents lived, and that's where my father grew up. My father was the first to read in his family, and he said to me that words were the first beautiful thing he ever knew. And he used to recite great slabs of poetry 'til his death at the age of 98. And in this book, there's the contrast of two high forms of poetry, 19th-century English poetry and classical Japanese poetry, which the various Japanese characters within the book feel as moved by as Dorrigo Evans does by Byron and Tennyson and Shakespeare.__EOS__ I noticed that you pinched the title of the book from the 17th-century haiku master Basho. Are you an admirer of haiku?__EOS__ I am an admirer of haiku, and I'm a great admirer of Japanese literature in general. I think if ""The Narrow Road To The Deep North"" is one of the high points of Japanese culture, then the experience of my father, who was a slave laborer on the Death Railway, represents one of its low points. That was one of the great war crimes somewhere between 100 and 200,000 people died on the making of that now largely forgotten railway to nowhere. And so I wanted to use the forms and tropes of all that was best and most beautiful in the culture to describe what was most base and most terrible because it seemed to me these two things were very closely entwined, not just in Japanese culture, but within every human heart.__EOS__ Let me ask you about your dad. He was, I understand, a POW at this camp.",0,,748," When I was in my country, I used to see my family and got with friends and live happily, you know, but when I found myself in the refugee camp by myself and my grandma, and she's an old woman, you know, she can't take care of me, you know, and I was like just doing my thing. Of course, I was like totally traumatized because of what I've seen, what I saw. __EOS__ When you say what you saw, what does that mean? __EOS__ Like the horrible things that happened, like killed people in front of me, and they killed my father in front of me, you know. And like burning of houses, you know, raping. I saw all this difficulties in my life, you know, so I was totally traumatized, you know, but when I find music, then it's like a therapy. It helps my trauma a lot. __EOS__ What's the favorite song that you've ever written, maybe something you've written with Reuben. ",2,,749," Okay.__EOS__ And that is really where the danger is, I think, for America. Not for individuals. I had a job - before I went to the White House, I have a job now. The danger is for the American system as a whole when we are no longer are able to count on the fact that we will have a well-informed citizenry.__EOS__ Van Jones is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a visiting fellow at Princeton.

Explain what that is. __EOS__ Well, pride and ego up is an approach where you try to elevate the pride of the detainee. You stroke their ego. And then you use that in a spirit to say that they have power, they have what they call in Arabic wasta, which is power and influence. __EOS__ And were you, in fact, in any position to offer him a role in the leadership of Iraq? __EOS__ Well, to me, the role that he did play was to find and kill Zarqawi, which was a role in the future of Iraq, a very important one.

And, you know, the audience knows I'm older. The audience knows I make money. So why ignore that?__EOS__ Did it take you a while to catch up with that onstage?__EOS__ A little bit. It's - it's a delicate way. It's like how do I talk about this life and make it relate to everyone in the audience? So that's - it's a fine line. It's an art form just getting any rich joke - any joke in which you're rich - to work is really hard.",1,,753," Yeah. And this is, I think, the main - if I would say, the main problem of what has been discussed in the film, is strategy-versus-tactics. In tactics, we are excellent. The Israeli army, the Israeli security forces are great in tactics. We are - you know, we win every battle in tactics. We know - we invented those targeted assassinations. Believe me that the American security officials came to Israel, I know that, to the head of the Shin Bet, to the security forces, and learned how to conduct what they are doing now in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, whatever they're doing there with the drone attacks. How do you get the intel in order to get those pinpointed, targeted assassinations?__EOS__ In this film, it's really fascinating to hear them describe a lot of the really momentous events of the last, you know, 30 years in Israel. I mean, there were the intifadas and the Oslo peace process and how it was undone in part by settlements, and in part by terror attacks. And there's a fascinating moment where one of these former intelligence leaders, Ami Ayalon, describes a conversation with a Palestinian psychiatrist he knew.__EOS__ This was one of the most horrific moments in the conversation that I did with the heads of the Shin Bet, where basically, Ami Ayalon said that this psychiatrist told him that for them, victory is to see the Israelis suffer. And then Ami Ayalon understood something very fundamental, that the two societies are so hung up with each other, or so connected with the cycle of violence and terror and fear and death, that they lost the meaning of what is victory.__EOS__ Dror Moreh's film is called ""The Gatekeepers.""

And that's...__EOS__ What accounts for that big gap?__EOS__ I mean, there are a couple factors. What Anu was talking about is a big factor in the military, which is, if you are sexually assaulted and you are in the military, you have to report that to your boss. And then your boss decides whether you are telling the truth or the person you have accused is telling the truth. And so, I mean, there's just a lot of problems there, as you might imagine.",3,,755,"  And we should note that since then, unfortunately, your sister      passed away who was dealing with and fighting leukemia.  And I know that      you've done so much in bone marrow donation.  Talk to me a little bit      about what this year has been for you on that side. __EOS__  This year has definitely been one of ups and far, far downs, I      would say.  You know, losing my sister is like--I've I've never lost      anyone that was that close to me.  She kind of meant the world to me,      man.  I mean, she was everything.  She was not just my sister.  She was      my stylist, my home keeper, I would say.  Even though my children were      her nieces and nephews, she was like a mother because, you know, she      looked out for my kids a lot.

My daughter Anna was bullied at one high school - lasted at eight - seventh and eighth grade in one school that she went to. So instead of letting her go to the high school that she's supposed to go to, I transferred her to another school. And it all started because her brother and her got in a big fight in school. He's a seventh grader, she's an eighth grader, and called her gay. So immediately, this - I mean, this firestone erupted where she'd come home crying, saying the kids are spitting on her, mostly other girls, and her boyfriend - she was actually dating a boy at that time, but that didn't matter to anybody. And she's doing much better at the high school she's at now. She's been counseling and stuff.__EOS__ Well, Harvey Weinstein, there's a scene in the film where a kid is approached by a school official and said, you know, asked to shake hands with the guy who's been bullying him - and, Michael, thanks very much for the call - and refuses to do so because he said he's apologizing but he doesn't mean it. And she says, wait a minute. Does he stop this behavior? Yes, but he does other stuff.__EOS__ Mm-hmm. Well, I mean, I think what Michael's talking about, these incidents, they're just so inbred in our culture, and, you know, we've got to make it uncool, you know, to do this. You know, it's funny. I've asked a number of designers, you know, to design t-shirts, and one of them was Rachel Roy, I mean, who has this fabulous line of clothing. And she, you know, put an emblem on a t-shirt and said, I don't date bullies, you know? And she's, you know, a beautiful woman herself, Rachel, and I love the idea of, you know, there's nothing stronger than a woman protest, in my opinion and, you know, and just, you know, we just have to make this culture a very uncool thing to do. And that's, I believe, is when it will go away.",1,,761," Yeah. __EOS__ So - but in terms of emotional things, I - personally, I enjoy that, allowing myself to feel what the character would be feeling. I mean, it's my own emotion that I'm dealing with. It's not displaced. I'm not thinking about some other memory. I'm not pretending something, somebody else that's creating a reality of the situation. As an actor, we're - the emotions of the character are yours, and that they're very real and that you do feel them, whether it's sadness or anger or grief or embarrassment or whatever it might be, you know, that just, to me, is fun. I just enjoy working that way. And not that you can't act those things and - but there's, you know, there's nothing less emotional or less touching than someone going... __EOS__ You know, it's just pretending. They're upset about something, you know. I mean, it's - I just see - I just personally see through that stuff.

How does writing, songwriting happen for you? Do you carry around a little notebook?__EOS__ I do have a notebook that I do use, and sometimes I end up having, like, three or four notebooks. One's, like, for my journaling, the other's for my lyrics, the other's for, like, thoughts I have. One I have for, like, my baby. I was like, OK. Wait a minute. I got too many books here.

I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it; is it Lu-den Marshall, or Loud-en Marshall?

And there are things about this country they truly love, and it has become their home. I don't think they would deny that. But at the same time, for my parents, I don't think either of them will ever consciously think, I'm an American. I don't think that's possible for them.

We played in a basement, and she happened to be there. And then we played at this place called the Varsity in Dinkytown a couple of days later and she showed up there and everyone was - we got everyone to come up on stage and start dancing and she was the only one sitting down in the audience.

We did talk about it. But then when she was actually dying, which would've been a year later, I said tell me your deepest darkest thoughts. And she said I'm not thinking about anything. And then shortly afterwards she went into a coma. __EOS__ Now the whole family was there at the end. ",2,,775," One of the things which is really astonishing, and humbling, to me is the fact that ultimately, the things that you have in common with somebody are much more important than the things that are potentially dividing you. And so we were brought face-to-face in very, very difficult circumstances, towards the end of my experience in prison. And because we were able to confront each other in terms of, you know, hey, what am I doing here? What are you doing here? And sort of move beyond that, you know, I was able to get to a place where we were able to be friendly again, and I'm grateful for that.__EOS__ How many years was she doing?__EOS__ She was sentenced to nine years in prison.__EOS__ Is she still in?",0,,776," Yes. __EOS__ And given a clean bill of health and you came out. In that most recent brush with our health care system, what did you see? I mean, you're sitting on a bill that could change the way that we organize health care, and you experienced care in a hospital, what do you learn? __EOS__ I see that in a hospital setting, there are a lot of tests involved in order to find out what has happened and why it happened and how to stop it from occurring again. Those tests are essential. But sometimes, well, you look at the broad population, they're excessive. And so what we need to do is to draw a line that balances the needs for understanding what's happening to people and not doing things that really don't offer a clear improvement in the ability of the medical profession to deal with the problem. __EOS__ There's a story you relayed in your book about Senator Dan Coats of Indiana and the bill to fund research on AIDS and to help patients with HIV AIDS. And he, like a lot of conservative Republicans from a conservative state, really were quite reluctant to get involved in this. And in that case, it's the way you name a bill that - and frame an issue - that can bring along a reluctant and critical vote. ",0,,777,"  Exactly.  And I'm sure you're somebody who's very, you know, expressive to your family about what you're thinking.  I mean, you're a verbal guy. You're about communication.  So, what was that period of three months when you really couldn't talk? __EOS__  Well, I was just so grateful to have made it through the operation and to have made it through a kind of - well, my only time of fear was that I would not rise to the occasion in the hospital.  I mean, there was probably some pride involved. I don't see myself as a valiant fellow.  And I did really quite splendidly in the hospital, came out and did well at home, and I took such great pleasure in responding positively rather than negatively to what had happened to me that I probably blunted in my own consciousness the unfortunate fact that I couldn't talk.  I could squeak. I certainly could - I could make myself known but - I could read, which is one of my favorite things to do in all the world. __EOS__  Was there a period where you thought that if you weren't right with the diagnosis, if you couldn't handle the pain or the recovery or the fear of death, the approach of death, that you would have been proven to be a fraud because here you've been, you know, making death a central part of your vision of religion. __EOS__  There's no question about that, and that's why I was so relieved.  And I tested my own acceptance because I was afraid that I could fool myself.  I would so need to do well.  I needed to ace the death exam having made death such a pivot of my own theology.  Otherwise, there would have been a kind of most deeply felt I think by me, a sense that I have been a snake oil salesman of some sort.

And it was an event and I photographed her at a table, and it surprised her. And it was frightening. Her face was  with fright. The expression, the Adam's apple popped out, sort of.

But really is, fundamentally, none of our business? __EOS__ I have to say that, thank goodness, at Newsweek, they want to know some of those things, but there is not a push push. I'll ask, and if a person sort of, you know, shuts it downダﾝ I have a story where I talk about Bill Cosby - and I interviewed him about a month after his son had died. __EOS__ He was murdered. __EOS__ Yeah, he was murdered. And I was so worried about how am I going to ask this man who was clearly, you know, in mourning, about his son. There's no polite way to do it. And thank God, he brought him up. He said, I know you didn't want to ask about my son, let me talk to you about him. So I've been fortunate in some cases where people sort of, you know, know the game. They know that you, you know, have to ask the tough questions. ",0,,783," There are checkpoints scenes too, you know, at Israeli checkpoints in the West Bank. Did you have to get permission from the Israel government or from the government in the West Bank to shoot there? __EOS__ Well, we actually created those checkpoints. We created a checkpoint in which we shot both of those scenes, because it would've been impossible for us to shoot anywhere near a real checkpoint. We did have the permission of the Palestinian Authority and we shot entirely within the West Bank. So as long as we were building our checkpoint in the West Bank nowhere near the borders, then we had no, you know, we were told that we wouldn't have a problem, and we didn't actually. We found a location that we thought would work. We built, you know, we built the concrete blocks. We graffitied the walls. We put up the barbed-wire and the plastic bags that we stuck to the barbed-wire and the piles of trash and the guard stands. And, you know, we brought in Palestinians to put on the Israel solider uniforms and play the Israel soldiers. So it was all... __EOS__ The Palestinians are playing Israeli soldiers? __EOS__ That's right. ",1,,784," My guest is Ruth Reichl. She's been the editor-in-chief of Gourmet Magazine for the last 10 years. The November edition is the magazine's final one. Reichl's new book features a thousand recipes from the last 10 years of Gourmet. It's called ""Gourmet Today."" We'll talk about her memoir, ""Not Becoming My Mother,"" after a break. This is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ Ruth, you have a memoir that you published recently. It's really about your mother's life, not your own, although you figure into it, and it's called ""Not Becoming My Mother  and Other Things She Taught Me Along the Way."" And for people who've been following your writing over the years, they know that your mother was bipolar, that your mother was what you call food-blind, that she would serve the most horrible combinations of food, like chocolate over meat, with the meat gone bad. And she couldn't tell the difference between, you know, tasty food and horrible food or food that was good and food that was moldy. __EOS__ Well, I think that there are so many of us whose mothers had very sad lives. And, you know, what I discovered with my mother was that she was thwarted in every possible way, and her - what she wanted for me was not to become her. She wanted more for me, and I think that there are many, many women whose mothers dreamt that their daughters would have better lives and pushed them towards that. And, you know, this book came out of a speech that I gave, and when I looked up, there were people all over the room crying and saying that's my mother you talked about. You know, my mother was smart, educated and bored to death, and... __EOS__ You write in your book that you're grateful not to be any of the women of your mother's generation, who were unlucky enough to have been born in what seems to me to have been the worst possible time to have been a middle-class woman. When was your mother born, so we can get a sense of what her generation was? ",0,,785, How did you deal with it?__EOS__ Medication was really the primary answer for her. Alleviating her anxiety to the point that then we could give her other things focus other than when we were leaving her and then it was a process. Once I was able to alleviate her anxiety of helping her to give other things to do. Katie's favorite activities were then left for when we would leave at the beginning of the day to go to work in our respective practices - my wife and I.__EOS__ And did it get to the point where you could take her off the medication?__EOS__ We tried twice with Katie and both times she had relapses so she was one of those dogs that I was never able to get medication completely.,0,,786," We need to take a short break. But when we come back, we'll have more with our guests, Borzou Daragahi, Middle East correspondent and Beirut bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times. And Rawya Rageh, reporter for Al Jazeera English in Cairo. We're talking about the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia. We'll talk about what's next and the impact that these uprisings may be having on the rest of the region. __EOS__ I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. __EOS__  The force of the Tunisian feminist movement is that we've never separated it from the fight for democracy and a secular society. We will continue our combat, which is to make sure that religion remains completely separate from politics. __EOS__ So I wanted to ask you about this, that as you told us earlier, the protests initially were sparked by a man who was very unhappy about his inability to progress economically, to find employment, and he set himself on fire and this sparked this larger, you know, uprising, which led to the president leaving the country. ",3,,787," Right.__EOS__ It was a PlayStation. And just when the police were starting to get demoralized is when they had their breakthrough.__EOS__ How did they ultimately get on the right track and plan a sting operation?__EOS__ Well, the investigation - after several goose chases - were reaching a point where they really were beginning to turn their attention toward the serious possibility that it was an inside job. At that moment, they received the final of several notes from the bad guys. And it directed them to place 1 million Euro in cash in a suitcase and deliver it to the cemetery in the town of Chambolle-Musigny, which is a small hamlet just to the north of Vosne-Romanee. And the plan was that because Monsieur de Villaine was out of town, Jean-Charles Cuvelier, his right-hand man, volunteered to be the bag man. He carried in a bag of counterfeit cash into the cemetery. And shortly thereafter, one of the bad guys emerged to come and collect it. And that was the beginning of the end.",0,,788," First of all, to make it clear, this is emphatically not a book about my religious search. I've tried, as objectively as possible, really, to tell the stories of nine people and keep myself out of it. But there's no question that over the 25 years I've been in India and the regions of India, have completely altered the way I look at the world. And it's something you dont notice as it happens, because it's a slow drip process. __EOS__ Thanks very much. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ William Dalrymple, author of ""Nine Lives  In Search of the Sacred in Modern India."" ",0,,789," And I just said, no, no, no, no, no. This is, there's nothing harmful about feeling like you're a member of the family. In fact, it really solidifies the relationship. And frankly, I think a lot of the law suits that happen in this country today take place because of rudeness, because of distance, because of inconsideration on the part of the physician. Whereas, if they would open up and be close like your physician is, sounds like he's done a great job with you, it would be a lot better. __EOS__ Oh, yeah. In regards toダﾝ __EOS__ Just hold on for a second, Justin. I want to say, a lot of doctors say they don't have the time to do that. __EOS__ Oh, I don't think that's right. You know what, my visits have gotten shorter and shorter, and the depth of those visits has gotten deeper and deeper. Part of it has to do with experience, yes. Part of it has to do with the fact that I'm writer, because as a writer, your antenna are always up. I mean, you're always paying attention. And so, that helps being a doctor quite a bit, to be paying attention all the time. ",0,,790," Right.__EOS__ They got their lab, but they had to disguise it...__EOS__ Right. Well, I think the character-driven element needs to be in there. And, you know, before we made this movie, they said the same thing, like, nobody wants to see scientists and nobody, you know, we have to dumb down the science. And they told me science wasn't visual, which I take huge issue with because it's a very visual movie, ad we found lots of ways to show the science.__EOS__ Who were the they that told you these things, the producers?",1,,791, Mr. Otis?__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ What you do you think? Yeah.__EOS__ Being part of a legacy is what I can talk about.,2,,792," That's a really interesting piece of the whole drone story. Yes, so there's, for example a company - an English company called Kinetic that built, has a drone that has, in the test in Arizona in I believe it was 2010, stayed up over Arizona continuously for about two weeks, and that drone, despite having a wingspan of over 100 feet, it weight roughly, if I remember correctly, on the order or somewhere between ダ_ from 60 to 70 pounds. It was very light, given its size.__EOS__ And what would they do at that height? You said 60,000 feet?__EOS__ Yes, so for example at 60,000 feet, you can survey an absolutely enormous amount of territory, and so drones at that height would be able to - would presumably have not one camera but probably a whole array of cameras mounted on the underside and would be able to then perform surveillance of some enormous, you know, hundreds of square miles or even more from that vantage point.__EOS__ Now, we already have these satellites, which have enormous, you know, resolution cameras in them. What could the drones do that the satellites wouldn't?",3,,793,  Por favor.__EOS__  No comprende.__EOS__  Gracias.__EOS__  De nada.,1,,794," Now just Turks. Now we're just Turks. No longer, yeah. But anyway - but we had to take the responsibility of carrying the struggle along, and of course one of the things that pleases me is that now at least we have a new constitution, which is a much more progressive constitution than any we have had before. And I hope that the struggle continues. When it is implemented, life will be very different from the past. Of course, that sort of depends on politics. But to come back to your question, I don't think that I want my kids to follow my footsteps, no. My wife and I were very clear about that. Our feeling that the kids should follow what they feel is their calling.__EOS__ Obviously as a parent you must be very proud of your daughter - all of your children, but we're talking about, you know, Lupita now. But what do you think is the meaning of what has happened with her? Not just the awards for her acting, but all of the acclaim about her beauty and her style and her elegance. Does it have any importance in your view?__EOS__ Well, it does. I mean, the beauty and the style and the dressing, however, that will never - we never really expected. I mean, look, that came to us as a surprise. I guess as a parent you don't really appreciate this. But I was surprised. I never knew but when all of this happened, then there came this conversation she had been having with her mom about beauty. They never told me. I learned like everybody else that it was something that was important in their lives. And of course the mother kept affirming to her that she was beautiful. So I think when this happened at her level, it was a fantastic affirmation of what her mother instilled in her - to believe in herself. And I think, to me, it helped give us strength - that there is more to you than you think, and that you should give the best of yourself to the world. And I think that the thing that she's trying to strive as is always to do her best in whatever she does, but do it in the service of humanity.__EOS__ Well, thank you for coming in to speak with us.",3,,795," Well, you know, recently ""Rolling Stone"" magazine published a list of the most important Latin rock bands and albums, and Cafe Tacvba was number one, and they were called The Beatles of Latin America, simply because they are just very eclectic. Everything they put out is really artful and thought out and well put together, and they're also just very spiritual and poetic and political. So I don't know. Felix, what do you think? The Beatles of Latin America?__EOS__ I'm always careful about the so-and-so of this country, but one of the things that really made them stand out was the way they incorporated traditional Mexican music into a whole new attitude, a whole new approach to music, and this is coming from their earliest albums, from the early to mid-'90s, and they've always maintained that nice hybrid of modern and traditional Mexican music.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, we're talking about the South by Southwest Festival in Austin. I'm speaking with Jasmine Garsd and Felix Contreas; they co-host NPR's ALT LATINO podcast.__EOS__ I saw a band last night called Las Cafeteras and they're based in Los Angeles. And what - they're part of a movement of young Chicanos, young Mexican-American musicians in Southern California that are rediscovering a style called Son Jarocho from the Veracruz area of Mexico. And it's a very traditional, lot of traditional instruments, but their music is very politicized, very socially conscious. They've got a really wonderful track called ""La Bamba Rebelde"" from their latest album. It reflects exactly what they're about, a little bit of tradition with a little bit of today's attitude.",3,,796," It's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep them because in spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart. I simply can't build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion, misery and death. I see the world gradually being turned into a wilderness. I hear the ever-approaching thunder, which will destroy us too. I can feelダﾝ __EOS__ I can feel the sufferings of millions, and yet if I look up into the heavens, I think that it will all come right, that this crueltyダﾝ __EOS__ ダﾝthat this cruelty too will end and the peace and tranquility will return again. In the meantime, I must uphold my ideals for perhaps the time will come when I should be able to carry them out. Yours, Anne. __EOS__ I think that is kind of ironic that she says that she hopes that she goes on living long after she dies. And she says that in her diary, which is what keeps her voice alive like 50 years later. ",0,,797," In America, the sort of story goes that you find the e-mail from your husband's mistress and you march into the living room and you say, I gotcha, you know, this relationship is over. And in France there isn't an assumption that you would even confront your spouse about what happened. It's something that you might sense for years and never bring to the surface.  __EOS__ Are you saying that a husband, say, might be sitting there and have reason to suspect that his wife is having an affair, and he might not be thrilled about it but just kind of shrugs and says, oh well, maybe I'll go have an affair. __EOS__ I don't think he shrugs and says, oh well. I think he cares a lot. But I don't think that he thinks that the best way to deal with the problem of infidelity in a marriage is to confront it directly or to go into therapy and talk about what's going on. You know, husbands would tell me, I just kept watching, and you know, I thought that my wife was having an affair with my best friend and I just gave my wife the sort of space to figure it out. And then at a certain point I sensed that the affair had ended. __EOS__ Do you think that you got somehow at the character of different nations by exploring the way that people in different countries cheat?

Poor child, didn't know any better than to talk to me. __EOS__ And I was thinking the night about how we celebrated her 24th birthday when she was in law school and all the ones we'd celebrated since. __EOS__ Oh, that's sweet. Lots of Hillary supporters showed up too. But really, no presents. No presents, please. ",2,,799," Absolutely. I support the Webb amendment. Most of the deaths come in multiple deployments. And I found that in calling my families in Nevada after these deaths occur. It's only appropriate that you are out of the country as long as you're in the country. And what Webb has done says that, and I support that. The last time this was voted on, we have 56 votes. We need 60. Now, with Tim Johnson back, it's 57. We need three more courageous Republicans.__EOS__ Now, when you talk about this slim majority, when you listen to the testimony on Capitol Hill this week, there was clear frustration expressed by a number of Republicans. It seemed like that would be an opportunity for you to, perhaps, pull some support from across the aisle?__EOS__ Talk is cheap. And I - I've reached down. I announced early in August that I want to work with Republicans. I want to give them a chance to keep their word. We have numerous quotes from Republicans in the spring saying we're going to wait until September. Since September, things have not changed. And so if that isn't a reason for a few Republican change, I don't know what is.__EOS__ Senator Reid, thank you very much for speaking with us.",3,,800," When Women Come Marching Home,"" highlights some of the challenges these veterans and those who served before them face.

And he has all of these exercises to help accomplish that. So he puts you through one of these exercises, and it's called processing, and it's - he gives you a series of rapid-fire questions that you're supposed to answer. And the first time he does it, it doesn't go that well. The second time he insists that you not blink.

I read one of them, and based from what I've heard from Ms. Alba - which was clarified by the students that we share - I disagree with the principal. __EOS__ There was a lot of confusion among parents. Some agreed that the school took the right step. Many others, like Marcia Olsten, an African-American parent of one of the seventh graders, thought Celerity administrators were clearly wrong. She took particular issue with the school principal, who Olsten says told students who wanted to honor Till that if the teenager had whistled at a white woman 57 years ago, it was sexual harassment. __EOS__ When I found out what happened, I called and I spoke to Mrs. Canada and I explained to her what my son had told me.

But there were times when he didn't always live up to      what he taught.

And so I thought that was kind of ironic. And -__EOS__ I'm not surprised they tried to sue you, though, just the same because you did sort of strip the song of its cheery, whimsical quality. __EOS__ I guess you could say that and be on the money, yeah. But sometimes that's what a song needs in order to survive that time it was born in. I thought it worked. __EOS__ Yeah, I bet it was. Just lacks a certain cavalier quality to the hi-ho, hi-ho part.

When that happened, then the fear flared up in the children as well. __EOS__ Jerry got it, Jerry got it, Jerry got it, you know. Luckily, Jerry got better and had no bad effects. __EOS__ In several of your recent novels you've written about the assault against the body that aging brings, just like how the process of aging breaks down the body, the diseases and dysfunctions that come with aging. __EOS__ Whenever I began this book, two years ago, let's say - I finished it about a year ago - I began it as I sometimes do with a book, which is on a yellow legal pad. I began to write down all the subjects or historical events that I've lived through that I've not dealt with in fiction. ",0,,826," Isabella, I hope you don't mind my asking this, but there's been a lot of discussion around getting more girls interested in the so-called stem field science, technology, engineering and math. A lot of people wonder, you know, why is it that, in other countries that are competitive in these fields, you know, girls are doing well. Women are present in these fields, but in this country, it seems like we're having kind of trouble with that. And I just wondered if you could speak to that. I mean, is it a kind of thing where - are girls somehow sort of given the feeling that they're not supposed to be interested in these things? Has anybody ever made fun of you for being interested in these kinds of things?__EOS__ Particularly me, no. But one of my other teammates said that, once we were at the actual competition last year, before we launched, that there was an all guys team that was, like, telling her, oh, well, you know, we won last year and we did great. And, like, they were kind of intimidating her and many people believe that this is, like, primarily a male field, so women are often discouraged or made fun of when they do that. And even though, myself personally, I have not experienced that, I've heard a few stories from people who say that they have.__EOS__ Darius, you would never do anything like that. Would you?__EOS__ Never.",3,,827," If you're just joining us, my guests are Michael Kranish and Scott Helman of the Boston Globe. They're co-authors of the new book ""The Real Romney""; it's just been published in paperback with a new afterword.__EOS__ Well, let me provide some perspective. There's been a lot of talk about the last 10 years of Mitt Romney's tax returns because Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has alleged, without providing evidence, that Mitt Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. So the context for this and the paradigm that really should be set is Mitt Romney's own words.__EOS__ One of the questions that has been raised based on the Bain financial records that were released is that there were investments that, you know, the partners, and I think Romney would be included in these investments, investments in funds that hold complex securities that can profit from downturns in the economy like by shorting stocks, by betting against interest rates in foreign currencies, credit default swaps, which can bet that something's going to lose, and you gain if they lose.__EOS__ Right. The dilemma in discussing this is that these are funds that his blind trustee person decided to invest in.",0,,828," I sing from a happy place.__EOS__ Well, Ingrid, we have time for just one more song, and I'm going to say goodbye to you before we hear it.

This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ Let's get back to Francis Ford Coppola recorded last September at the Toronto International Film Festival in conversation with the festival's co-director Cameron Bailey. Coppola also took some questions from the audience. Here's one of them.__EOS__ The question I wanted to ask is, actually, if you could talk about your writing process, your habit, sort of what's a daily writing day like for you.",1,,830," And this was like, this was a condition that went on for some time and by - one time my wife got in the car and started the car before I changed the station and it was playing rock 'n' roll and she said, oh, I love rock 'n' roll. And I said, you do? You know, big surprise, huh? Oh wow. __EOS__ You might be one of the few adults who had to hide rock 'n' roll. __EOS__ Yeah, well, it was strange, you know? It was a strange time. It's like, it's easy to accept pop art and it's easy to accept abstract expressionist art most places these days. But in the old days if you had an abstract painting, that was really weird. And if you had a soup can or a cartoon hanging in your house, I mean who were you? What kind of weird person? And listening to rock 'n' roll was like listening to the jungle or something. It just was unheard of. I mean it was not accepted. __EOS__ Now, television, as we mentioned, you were doing a lot of episodic television in the - I guess the late '50s, early '60s? ",1,,831," Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah. Well, I mean, I kind of regard them as the same thing. And it's hard to explain that to people. They don't quite understand why, you know, how you can work in such a visual medium and how you can also work with words. But it's the way I've developed really. And I just don't see any real difference in the creative instinct, in the imagining or the dreaming up of the particular piece of work.__EOS__ So, how did you get into films and why?__EOS__ Growing up as a writer in the late '60s, 1968, 1972, you felt you lived in a country that was haunted by words. You know, you felt, I mean, I was born in Sligo, where W.B. Yeats was born and lived. Between these two figures, Yeats and Joyce and probably Samuel Beckett, and, you know, you kind of felt every acre you walked on was kind of trodden. I was already covered by acres of print, you know. And it's, for me, starting with the first time I wrote a screenplay, I felt tremendous freedom actually, you know, because it just felt to me that this is an area that had not been explored by the Irish imagination in any creative way in Ireland. And I just got tremendously excited and all overtaken by it.__EOS__ Do you ever, now that you're a filmmaker, envy the special effects budget that a novelist can use?",0,,832," She's standing in front of a house in a letter jacket. Her arms are crossed, fists clenched; her mouth firmly set.__EOS__ Townes and I were in that house just absolutely, obnoxiously drunk. And she'd had enough; and she just got up, put her jacket on and left. And that has always been my favorite picture of Susanna. From the moment I saw it that day, I have held on to it and saved it 'cause that's - was Susanna.

I know. It's borderlines on yodeling. I love yodeling though. It's just one of my favorite things. __EOS__ Did your grandfather teach you to yodel? __EOS__ He died. He got Lou Gehrig's disease and I never really got to sing around him. But I think that he'd be real proud about my yodeling because I think I may have learned it from him. ,2,,834," Well, I don't really hear this is a bluegrass record. I think if people expect to hear those kind of tunes, they might be a little surprised by the contents of this record. The instrumentalists that accompany me on the record undoubtedly have played that music. And the sounds, the instrumental colors, are quite commonly found in bluegrass. __EOS__ These are all my songs or songs I've co-written with the exception of one. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And I just found they were - there was a very good environment for the kind of narrative song that I had in my bag when I got together with my friend T. Bone Burnett with the idea of making this record. ",2,,835," Each of you contributed a solo piece. Mike Auldridge chose a medley of ""Till There Was You,"" the Meredith Wilson favorite from ""The Music Man"" and ""Moon River.""__EOS__ Did Auldridge, you know, tell you why he chose these two songs?__EOS__ I think that he was a little older than us and came from an era - and he loved the melodies and it's very difficult play. But Mike was very fluent in the music of that time.__EOS__ Tell me about the song ""The Perils Of Private Mulvaney.""",2,,836," Thank you.__EOS__ What does oka mean?__EOS__ Oka means listen in the Bayaka language, Aka.__EOS__ Speaking of the Bayaka language, the character of Larry is played by Kris Marshall and most of his dialog with the Bayaka is in their language.

You know, they were all fuzzy and wooly looking and we had an old car that kind of bit the dust and my dad parked it out back of the barn and that's where it was laid to rest.__EOS__ So, you know, I just remember being bundled up.

We mentioned this was your first screen role, but you'd done a lot of live television, hadn't you?__EOS__ Oh, yes, lot of live television. But that was the first time I actually stepped on a stage where they were making a movie.__EOS__ Did you know you were making a classic?",1,,840," I had wanted to ask - first of all, Im very proud of what you do and appreciate that there's someone out there doing these kinds of films. I know you're not alone in that. And if this were the '50s, you'd be blacklisted. __EOS__ Sure. __EOS__ But I wanted to ask, what do you think was the impact of your experience in Vietnam on how you see how this country operates? __EOS__ Well, it's pretty -  a young man. I grew up here during Cold War. I was - and we know and then one day . There is - even now there's a revisionist approach.

And we talked about how their perceived their own future when they were just starting out.__EOS__ Our whole career in inverted commerce, has actually been a 35-year accident. Paul and I started out as two teenagers in the back room of his mum's house, with no musical training, virtually no equipment and just this mad aspiration to do music that was somehow going to be the future. And we had no desire to be a pop group or that would ever be successful or sell records. It was like our little art project. So, how we ended up selling millions of records and traveling around the world is still a mystery to us. But we're not complaining anymore.__EOS__ Yeah, we're not questioning it anymore.",2,,842," Do you have a question, Cindy? __EOS__ Yes, I do. I called to ask about if the author has any comments about the planetoid or dwarf planet Charon orbiting - in a 50-year orbit between Saturn and Uranus?

And I'll read R right now. __EOS__ And you would hear that from your own mother or your aunties, or something like that? __EOS__ They always said remember. And, in fact, before I made the decision to become a writer, my grandmother was getting along in years, and her health was suffering.

Did you stop doing that?__EOS__ No. I still do that.__EOS__ You still do that?__EOS__ I still - it still kind of just happens in my head. And maybe because, and it's kind of leaked into this book, that obsession with death and trying to sum up someone's life who has meant so much to you in a way that - and to express it. And it's safer to express it when that person's not in the same room with you. So, you know, eulogies are way - I think everyone in some way wishes that, you know, when they're giving a eulogy to someone that that person was there so they could hear it. So that they could, you know, actually hear how much that person has meant to you. You're just filled with regret.",0,,850," Oh, yeah. I'm 51 now so - but, you know, I know that physically working out is something that's really, really important. So, you know, sometimes I go away from it for months at a time and then I come back to it, because I know that that's the only way I can physically perform these characters.

But, you know, that's - we knew what we were getting into, shooting a movie with horses and a 13-year-old. __EOS__ It makes scheduling a movie enormously more complicated. And it does force you, unfortunately, in certain situations, to do scenes or the coverage of Jeff or Matt, for instance, sometimes had to be done with another actor who was essentially standing in for Hailee at that point because you still have to shoot the day. __EOS__ As a rule, if youre, in the movie, if you're looking at a shot of Jeff or Matt over the shoulder of the character Mattie, it's usually not Hailee but usually an adult double in her wardrobe.

I mean, there's comic gold there, but everybody had done their jokes by the time your night came around, which is Thursday night. So how did you decide what you were going to do with that?__EOS__ Well, I think one of the things I have on my side is because I'm, you know - you know, even just looking at me, I don't look the same as the people who are on late-night TV doing those jokes.

John Lewis is one who ended up the victim of a robocall, saying some very, very derogatory things about him. __EOS__ And just to be clear. Have you been the target of those threats yourself? __EOS__ Well, I had a person in my district to send out a newsletter, which I know he didn't pay for. It was distributed primarily in the African-American  community, during which he suggested that I had been paid by Senator Clinton to support her. I don't know if there's anybody who hasn't taken some grief for supporting Senator Clinton who's African-American. __EOS__ You know, Congressman Cleaver, it sounds like you, yourself, have been caught off guard a bit by what's going on here, what's evolved in this campaign. Is it fair to say that when you endorsed Hillary Clinton back in August last year, that you didn't anticipate that you would be in this situation now where Barack Obama has emerged as, apparently, the frontrunner and Hillary Clinton is struggling?

That was their first and strongest mission, and for a long time they saw their two goals as economic and in foreign affairs. Something - economically what they, the core members, came to call biblical capitalism, the idea that capitalism is ordained by the Bible in a very sort of deregulated, laissez-faire, privatized market; and foreign affairs, a kind of expansionist view of what might be called a soft empire for America. __EOS__ What about culturally and socially? What are some of the leading issues on The Family's agenda? __EOS__ Well, this is really interesting. I mean, this is one of the things that distinguishes them, historically, from what I call the populist front of fundamentalism, who were always concerned with domestic social issues. The Family historically wasn't. They took - generally took the same conservative line on those issues, but that wasn't their focus. In recent decades, they've sort of expanded to address some of those issues. __EOS__ Before we get to the Stupak-Pitts Amendment and its connection to The Family, can you just do a roll call of some of the prominent senators and congressmen who are affiliated with The Family?

We used to think they were... __EOS__ Yes. In certain parts - we used to think - in part because of Ramoni Kahal. Even giants occasionally miss certain things. We thought that you're born with all the cells. They can die, but you don't get new ones. And now we know that are certain regions of the brain that have stem cell potential, and they continue to divide. In the olfactory part of the brain and also in the certain part of the hippocampus, a memory storage site, there are small residues of new cells being born. __EOS__ And we can train other parts of the brain to take over. __EOS__ Well, that's a different point...

You know, when you're dealing with like small farmers who are doing sustainable farming and a more natural approach, it costs more. At least it must cost more, because restaurants that serve that tend to... __EOS__ ...tend have more expensive menus. Like the price-fix menu at Chez Panisse in the week that we're recording, in the week in August that we're recording, weekdays it's around $80 for the price-fix downstairs and weekends 95, and that's for, it's for several courses. And, you know, for a fine restaurant that might not be very expensive but for, you know, a typical person wanting to have a meal out, $80 or $95 a person, not counting wine, not counting tip, that's a lot of money. __EOS__ It is a lot of money. It is a lot of money. But I think that we have to understand that we want to pay the farmers the real price for the food that they produce. And it won't ever be cheap to buy real food. But it can be affordable. And it's really something that we need to understand. It's the kind of work that it takes to grow food. We don't understand that piece of it. And it's what we're trying to do with the Edible Schoolyard in the public schools. __EOS__ Sometimes I see like two extremes of food in America. You know, one extreme being like the supersized portion of like... ",3,,863," Right. I remember this very well. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Jordan at the time that this happened in November 2002. And in fact, this is really the moment where I first had the idea for the book, almost a decade ago. And you're exactly right. There was a cover story in place. There was a U.S. drone strike that took out the head of al-Qaida in Yemen at the time. A Yemen spokesperson told the BBC, the Associated Press, all of the news and wire services that a bomb the militants had been transporting had exploded. And then what we have is a situation where the Yemenis really felt as though they were sold out for domestic U.S. political concerns. So this happens right before the midterm elections. The Bush administration wants to use this to give its congressional allies sort of a leg up to show that the Bush administration is really serious, this is an early victory in the war on terror. And essentially what happens is - I mean, there's a scene in the book in where this Yemeni political official is just screaming at the United States, and he's saying, you know, this is why people really hate to work with you. This is why it's so difficult to work with the United States, is because you take one victory and you attempt to exploit it. And you can't give the enemy; you can't tell the enemy what's going on. And this is really the moment where that initial period of goodwill between President Saleh and then-President George Bush came to an end. It's after this that you see President Saleh being much more cagey about his interactions with members of al-Qaida and assisting the United States. So this is one of those old things that our mothers and our grandmothers used to tell us, sort of penny wise but pound foolish.__EOS__ So let me skip ahead to the bin Laden assassination. What impact do you think that had on - or that it continues to have - on al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based in Yemen?__EOS__ Right. One of the things that we've seen is that Osama bin Laden, contrary to much of what we were being told by security officials, that he was actually in pretty close contact with a lot of different organizations, whether it was the branch in Yemen or other branches, that he was - whether or not he actually had control, I think, is a bit debatable, but he was certainly writing letters and certainly acting as though he was still the head. The difference, I think, in Yemen is that the individual who's the head of this organization - he's a really short, short guy, very low-spoken, very soft voice, he has sort of facial hair that juts out from his face, almost like a billy goat - that this guy who spent so much time with bin Laden these four years as sort of his secretary, his aide-de-camp, he really knew what it was that bin Laden wanted or what he would want and, I think, he's been able to implement that blueprint. And so certainly bin Laden's death was a significant blow to him personally. And I write about this in the book and about sort of his heartfelt eulogy that he gives to his former sheik. But for the organization itself, the organization al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has had a certain amount of operational independence that the death of Osama bin Laden didn't affect. So it had much more of an impact, I think, on the U.S. psyche than it did on the psyche and the minds of those individuals within Yemen themselves.__EOS__ Is bin Laden's death something else for AQAP to avenge?",0,,864," Well, that was what slavery was. The thing that I think is - that people have to keep in mind is that this is how you have created mixed race Americans. Blacks as mixed raced Americans. It was not an unusual circumstance. John Wales had three wives and after the last wife died, he decided I guess not to get married again and took Elizabeth Hemings as a concubine. That is what their grand - that's the term that the grandson used as to describe this, and had six children with her. But this is what - this was not an uncommon thing in Virginia. People would come from the North and they would be, you know, shocked to see the number of mixed race children are running around there. I mean, if you think about it, it's very, very difficult. You can't have men and women in a house together, living in those kinds of animate circumstances. Blacks and whites lived together more closely in slavery than an any point in American history. Certainly closer than we do now. And so, you know, it was a natural thing to have happened. I'm not, you know, excusing it or whatever but I'm saying, some of those people - many of those women were going to be raped. Some of those people would have actually liked each other but mixing - that's what human beings do. And that's what happened with the Hemingses.  __EOS__ Here's an email question from Charles. How did you Jefferson's white staff deal with Mr. Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemings? I'm a descendant of Lieutenant John Key, a steward at Monticello. As the head man, would my grandfather have knowledge of the cohabitation or was things so secret Sally would come and go from Jefferson's private rooms without anyone knowing? __EOS__ Oh that's an interesting question. Interesting Monticello connection there. It's great. I think it was an open secret. Jefferson's neighbors talked about this. Jefferson's friend in a private diary talked about it. It was the kind of thing that I think everybody - people would understand. People understand that guys - men have mistresses. Men have girlfriends and I think that this is something that was definitely known in the community. People who visited Monticello talked about how much people in the neighborhood loved to discuss this. And so, I think your ancestor would have known about this very clearly. __EOS__ Let's see if we can get Charles on the line. Charles with us from Brighton in Michigan. ",0,,865," Yup, yup, yup. __EOS__ We're moving all those technical awards to that other crappy night. __EOS__ That's right. They're gone, gone, gone. __EOS__ Those are gone. And all the mixing, you know, costume. Maybe one costume and set design, but that's it. ",0,,866,  I heard you wrote a chicken sonata?  I read you wrote a chicken      sonata.  What's a chicken sonata? __EOS__  It's a sonata dedicated to chickens... __EOS__  You have chickens. __EOS__  ...and about chickens. ,2,,867," Mr. Whitaker, I'll start with you. People, of course, know your work as an actor. You won your Oscar in 2006 for ""The Last King of Scotland."" Many people will have seen you in ""The Great Debaters"" or ""The Crying Game"" or ""Platoon,"" you know, many other films.__EOS__ A number of things, as far as doing documentaries. One is that I think that one of the most empowering things that can happen for each of us as individuals is to really be heard. And I think that when we start to explore stories of individuals, we start to see the connections between us and them and this, like, allows us to become more human.__EOS__ Lisa, I know you shot a documentary at Angola some years ago. And is that how you heard about the hospice program?__EOS__ Yeah. I had done several pieces there, starting with an hour for ABC News on the death penalty. And I kept in touch with them and I learned that not only was this a hospice program where the inmates cared for their dying fellow inmates, but that there was a fair number of burnout - it's a very hard job to do - and that periodically, they would train a new crop of volunteer inmates and that that was going to be happening soon.",1,,868," Some things they say about blacksmiths. They're usually very happy people and they like music, not very stressed out.__EOS__ Oh, that sounds...__EOS__ You can take it all out with a hammer.__EOS__ Sounds like a good profession.",0,,869,  No.__EOS__  How many times you have intercourse with your aunt?__EOS__  Three times.__EOS__  Where's your aunt now?,1,,870,  You're absolutely right! __EOS__  It's getting hot in here. __EOS__  Are you nervous? __EOS__  What? ,3,,871," Oh, yeah. __EOS__ Oh, great. __EOS__ We've always been good friends, ever since we did the album. __EOS__ The track I want a play is called ""Miss Being Mrs."" You wrote all the songs on this album, and this is one of my favorites. I like the song a lot and also, I just love how stripped down it is. It's just you and a guitar. Is that Jack White on guitar? ",2,,872," ...just officially turned 13. __EOS__ So has he been bullied for being the son of gay parents? __EOS__ No - not at all. I mean we've sent him to the - I mean he's been lucky enough to be sent to some pretty liberal private schools in Seattle and where they have, you know, social justice programs, you know, in elementary school and he's had it pretty good, I think. __EOS__ If anything, you know, we joke that we're raising the kid who beat us up in grade school. ",0,,873," Physically, it's mainly getting in and out of a squat. You do it not only during the course of the game - which is actually the easier part - you do it in the bullpen, you do it in spring training, you do it doing the warm-ups, you do it prior to the game. __EOS__ And I imagine that you like a pitcher who works quickly. I mean, you're there crouching, and somebody who takes his time, you know, picks up the rosin bag, thinks it over, rubs his forehead while you're there crouching, does that make your day tougher? __EOS__ It definitely makes it tougher. When you have a pitcher who works quickly, not only works quickly in the sense that gets the ball, gets back on the pitching rubber and is prepared to get the sign and go, but works quickly in the sense that myself as the catcher and the pitcher are on the same page in terms of what pitch should be used in the situation against this hitter in this game, and there's not much shaking off going on. The pitcher's constantly in agreement with the catcher. That's the games that are fun and go quickly. __EOS__ Now, you have those deep knee bends you're doing all day, or at least all through the game and the warm-ups, but there are those times in the game when you get nicked. Now, I imagine the equipment's probably improved since you first started, right, the protective equipment? ",3,,874," And how long do you expect to stay - stay at the fire? __EOS__ There is no end - end date as of right now. We don't know, really. Fires like this that happen all through the fall, you know, through Christmas. The wind is going to dictate how long all of us stay here.  __EOS__ Inspector Paul Hartwell, he's an engineer and a public information officer for the County of Los Angeles Fire Department.

Let's listen to this one.__EOS__  Well, sometimes I seem to forget you're one of my best friends, not someone that I can just use you; someone I can use...__EOS__ I wrote this song for Raven, our drummer. There was a period of time where we kind of grew apart in a way. Like, you start out the bands, you start with music and you do something that you really love. And, you know, mainly you do it because you want to have fun and you're making music with friends. On the other hand, the ambition has always been to become, well, like every professional band, to become the biggest band in the world.",2,,876," Bye-bye. Here's an email from Scott  Thank you to Dana for telling the story of a remarkable group of people. I was three years old when my parents adopted a young boy from Operation Babylift. That young boy would become a wonderful brother, someone whom I feel close to, as I do my natural brother. __EOS__ I've certainly heard that a lot, and I think, I think particularly the children who were clearly homeless, I think that their situation is  it seems much better. It seems like they've had a very, very good and positive experience by growing up overseas and being able to go back to their homeland. __EOS__ You also point out that these were  even the tip of the iceberg is giving it too much credit. There were maybe 900,000 quote-unquote orphans in Vietnam in 1975, the vast majority of whom were in the care of extended families in their villages. __EOS__ Right, right. I think the American public got an idea of Vietnam at that time as really not being able to take care of their children because they would see the orphanages full of children and they would see the homeless children on the street. ",0,,877," Whether - I think like notched up $180 million dollars. So, I think people around the world are accepting it and liking it. __EOS__ Have you seen - you haven't seen ""Quantum of Solace"" yet? __EOS__ No, no. Unfortunately, we'd just gone to Paris when it opened in London. My book was being released in Paris where it's not called, ""My Word Is my Bond"" as we call it here.  which was the title of the series I did ""The Persuaders"" with Tony Curtis. __EOS__ Oh, I see another clever name there? Sir Roger Moore, he joined us from our bureau in New York his memoir is called ""My Word is Bond"" and let me say, if I maybe so bold, you sound just as dashing now as you ever did, sir. ",0,,878," Who gets to be a part of that? And for a long time, like a lot of folks that thought maybe civil unions. Let's - I believe in equal protection under the law. I've always believed that. But I've been listening to younger people, a new generation, and they've persuaded me that equal protection requires civil - a civic commitment to marriage equality. And so even people who aren't sure what they think about the larger issues and what the Bible says and theology, more and more people are saying civil equality is necessary here. So I said, yeah. I'm for marriage equality, for marriage, and also for same-sex couples being able to benefit from a re-covenanted notion of marriage.__EOS__ The reason I'm asking about that is that there are lots of people who say, look, I have gay friends. I have gay family members. I just believe that, for the benefit of society, for the common good, marriage has to be reserved for men and women, because that's what's in the best interests of society. How do you reconcile people who have very different views of what constitutes the common good?__EOS__ I think if we can come together around the need to restore and recommit, re-covenant to marriage, then the question is  What's really causing the problems? I think, you know, mass incarceration of men of color in urban communities is a big reason why we're losing marriage. The soaring divorce rate is a big reason why. I think, you know, often, male behavior in relationships is a big reason why, lack of wages that pay a living wage to support a family.__EOS__ ""My concern is not whether God is on our side. My greatest concern is to be on God's side."" So I try to apply that to the economy, to government, to all kinds of things. But I think that's the right question I think we need to ask. What is the common good? And, if it's a debate, let's have that debate.",0,,879," We'll hear more from the songwriting team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David after a break. __EOS__  Don't make me over.

Their songs are featured in the Broadway revival of ""Promises, Promises."" __EOS__ Let's talk about your other really big hit from the show, ""I'll Never Fall in Love Again."" There's a great story behind this song. So whichever one of you wants to start telling it, go ahead. ",2,,880," No. I mean, I definitely tried to be open-minded. I mean, he did - he brought out a few things where I said, oh, that was great. I've got something just like that at home. And he immediately turned around and put those back on the rack because I think the idea was to try and maybe give me some options that I wouldn't choose on my own. __EOS__ Was itダﾝ __EOS__ And how are the tight jeans going for you? __EOS__ I'm still a little numb, but it was okay. ",3,,881,"  Hmm. __EOS__  You know, people want to belong somewhere, and that, to      me, is one of the more profound personal experiences about this in--you      know, how rootless we are as a culture, how hard it is to have some      little place, you know, that we come back to.  But I know so many people      that love old cemeteries and just come into them and look around and let      their imaginations go and end up telling me often about some little      cemetery--maybe in Colorado on their grandmother's place or, you know,      someplace in Pennsylvania or Vermont--that every time they go back home,      they search out and they stand there among the stones. __EOS__  Shannon Applegate is the owner and sexton at Applegate Pioneer      Cemetery in Yoncalla, Oregon. __EOS__  Thank you so much, Jacki, for having me. ",0,,882," Now, wait a second. There were not just Afghans. There were American forces involved, Special Forces and CIA people... __EOS__ Fewer than 100 on the ground... __EOS__ Yeah... __EOS__ Fewer than 100.

So you and I, we continued doing the interview, and then at the end of the interview one of our producers walks into the studio and talks to me, and I'm going to pick up with my reaction.__EOS__ OK.__EOS__ Oh my God, wow. Seth?",1,,884," So we're not talking about, like, what we would see in modern terms, like a Camp David agreement, where there's an announcement, and everybody knows what it is. We're talking about completely secret deals.__EOS__ That's right.__EOS__ In which parties are misled about what they're in for.__EOS__ That's right.

They were a maze of secret deals between different nations and different parties throughout World War I.",0,,885," Thank you. __EOS__ What most do you want to hear from the president in the State of the Union? __EOS__ I think it's really critical that the president put down a marker around jobs. There's no question that that's what Americans are crying for. We're looking at a situation right now where somewhere in the neighborhood of 27 million Americans are either unemployed or underemployed. This is a crisis. __EOS__ Well, they sprung into action with the stimulus and no one expects the administration to approve another big stimulus or to get one through the Congress. What can they do to bring down unemployment? ",3,,886," You are - you are so excited right now that you get to give the big speech.

Have you been in that position where somebody's told you that they want to kill themselves and you have to decide what are you supposed to do with that?__EOS__ Well, it's a scary thing to ponder, you know, but it's emotional to hear that clip now because, I mean, I wrote that about a lot of comedians I knew coming up and comedy and show business are very cruel and they don't have a nice way of saying no or good-bye, you know? And a lot of guys live really tough lives in this racket.__EOS__ So you sent him this script in which he wants to kill himself. How did he react to that?",3,,887," And I was sort of wondering, did you see it the same way? __EOS__ For me it was very, very surprising. I knew that there was a connection in many ways, but I didn't know that we were going to be a duo. And so with his solo shows I would come up and guest-sing the harmonies or sing on the song, and people - it was the people around us who started saying you guys together, there's something there. __EOS__ What was the song? __EOS__ The title track of our album, ""The Here and The Now."" ",3,,888," They're hippies. I mean, they're not exactly hippies. My dad's a doctor. They didn't do a lot of drugs, and they didn't really drop out. But they had this vision of community and a way of living that was an alternate to the ambitious, anxious-ridden New York, East Coast scene. They wanted to be around animals and dirt and all this stuff. You know, they were part of that movement of urban kids in the late '60s and early '70s heading for the hills - the back-to-the-land movement. or as my dad wrote in his satire of that movement, the backwards-to-the-land-ers.__EOS__ Well, you have a song on the new album that sounds like it's very much about that place - about that part of Northern California where you grew up, ""Just A Child.""__EOS__  Way out West there is a place where nothing changes. If you're born there you will always be a child. Just veer off the highway 40 miles from Ferndale, a long and winding road will take you there.__EOS__ How much autobiography is in this song?",2,,889," That's right. I mean, if you're from the south of Ireland and with a Catholic background, in particular, you have a much more lilting kind of voice compared with the Protestant voice, which tends to be on the whole, somewhat sharper or more resonant in that sort of way. __EOS__ I remember talking to a man who was a professor and spoke beautiful received English, BBC English, and was teaching at university in Northern Ireland, and his students kept trying to get him to pronounce certain words so they could figure out, was he a Catholic or a Protestant. __EOS__ Yes. That's right. Accent is the way. You know, I mean, as I said a little while ago, you can try and deduce somebody's identity from the way they dress and so on and so forth, but the easiest way is always to try and judge it from the way they speak. __EOS__ Here's an email from Gary in San Antonio. I've heard that men have more of a tendency to hold on to their dialect and accent of wherever they originally came from, whereas women tend to change their dialect to suit the place they currently reside. Is there any truth to that?

It's a new book about race and baseball. __EOS__ When Jackie Robinson made it to the Dodgers, he opened the door for Latin players of color. And then in the 1980s, Major League Baseball began to realize how cheap they could sign players from the Caribbean. __EOS__ Every major league team has an academy or a facility in the Dominican Republic. This is a country of 10 million people. __EOS__ And several have them in Venezuela. ",0,,892," It - you know, share my advance. And I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to sell another book after this one, but I already have been getting my desk cleared to start finishing up the other two manuscripts. So obviously, it's something I just have to do.__EOS__ Do you ever think about the people who read you?__EOS__ If I thought that money was going to grow in a tree in my yard, just enough at least to get by, I wouldn't care if only 10 people read me. It doesn't matter that millions read as long as you share it with somebody. So I don't really think about readers or editors.

And I think that there are some things that we can tell each other using the music that usually a son and a father has difficulty to express. It's not easy to say I love you to a father. I have always seen my father living with his guitar and I had a lot of fantasy about where he was going and it was like maybe a secret dream of me as a child to follow him and now, I am following him.__EOS__ Gaspar Claus says the album came together a bit by itself - a beautiful gift, he calls it, that life gave him and his father, Pedro Soler; a gift he'll cherish for the rest of his life.

We're all trying to tell a good story that explains how the world works. And we're interested in understanding how it works, in exactly the same way that perhaps the early philosophers were; but we have much better tools with which to dissect it, and understand it, today. And the thing about science is, it's always based on the facts. So if the facts change, and you discover new ones - or many, many more new facts don't fit precisely with the old ones - then you have to change the story.__EOS__ So another thing I want to ask you about, is Botox. A lot of people get Botox treatments as a form of surgery-free cosmetic - surgery.__EOS__ And Botox is botulinum. It's a poison from spiders that's one of the most powerful, naturally occurring toxins that we know of. __EOS__ Oh, well, it's very interesting. What you're doing is, you're paralyzing the muscle. And the way you are doing that is, you're preventing this chemical signal - that travels from the nerve, to the muscle - from leaping the gap. So what happens when a nerve impulse fires off and runs down the nerve, to tell a muscle to contract, is when it gets to the end of the nerve cell, it's got to somehow or other signal to the next cell in the chain - the muscle cell - that the muscle cell must twitch. But the electricity cannot jump the gap between the two cells.",0,,895, No. __EOS__ Your version is only 200 pages. That's substantially shorter than the original. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ How did you decide what made the cut and what didn't? ,0,,896," Stunning that someone with such emotional troubles had so much access to deep, deep secrets in the U.S. government.__EOS__ That's correct.

Is there some thing - what are they worried about?__EOS__ I mean, it's an old instrument and it's kind of complex, and if you don't know what buttons you're pushing, you don't want to push those. And also, like, drinking some wine while you're playing the church organ is probably not a good idea.__EOS__ I know you - I've ever seen it during Sunday services, let me put it that way.",2,,898," The Enduring Conflict Between America and al-Qaeda,"" has just been published in paperback. Bergen just spent two and a half weeks in Pakistan, one of the many reporting trips he's made to the region. __EOS__ You know, Terry, they planned to celebrate the fifth anniversary of 9/11 with something that would have been spectacular and which was the so-called planes plot of the summer of 2006, which was an attempt to bring down seven American, Canadian and British airliners leaving Heathrow with hydrogen peroxide bombs. __EOS__ You produced bin Laden's first American TV interviews for CNN. __EOS__ Actually, it was the first TV interview he'd ever done. ",0,,899," Well, your book takes a look at black masculinity by focusing on different black men, by looking at relationships between black men and black women; it includes a chapter on black gay men, which you didn't name, but what I like to call Tyrone and Tyrone.  __EOS__ And there's much more. So first, what spurred you to write this book, and why did you feel that Tyrone needed to be deconstructed? Who's going to - Natalie H., why don't we begin with you?  __EOS__ Okay, well, we decided to do this project a few years ago because we wanted to do something outside the daily grind of the newspaper business. We wanted to do a project that reflected our experiences as black feminists of the hip-hop generation. And we felt that Tyrone, as you said, it has become this archetype, and it often has very little to do with the reality of most black men's lives in our generation. So this project really looks to dispel some of those myths and complicate our ideas of what Tyrone is.  __EOS__ Well, you have so much in this book. There is ""The Pole Test,"" interviews with strippers about their relationships with their fathers, the whole phenomenon of what we call babydaddy, black men at work. And I was just wondering, what chapter was the most interesting to both of you? Natalie Hopkinson?  ",2,,900," Let's move to the second set of songs, which are all performed by string quartets. And let's go back to ""It Don't Mean a Thing."" __EOS__ So, ""Don't Mean a Thing"" has this descending bass line and that framework is essentially all I took from ""Don't Mean a Thing"" and repeated that framework but then wrote something new on top of it. __EOS__ What are some of the challenges of re-imagining the music in this particular format for a string quartet? __EOS__ Actually, in some ways, having starting material makes my job as a composer a lot easier. The hardest stage of creating something is the idea. ",2,,901," I probably didn't really believe that I could take these songs and give them a fair translation or the delicacy and the intricacy and the sensitivity and the emotive elements of the writing, especially the Townes van Zandt song, ""Nothin'."" I just thought how can I - me, you know, I can understand me grabbing hold a Buffalo Springfield or Arthur Lee and running with that or running with the Tuareg guys from Paris or whatever. But how do I actually bring that home, because it's coming from another place by - from somebody's abstract pain. __EOS__ And your voice is sweet. __EOS__ Thank you, so as yours. I mean - no, but I meanダﾝ __EOS__ But you know what I mean. ",2,,902," Well, I would imagine. But, you know, you weren't raised in San Juan. You weren't raised in the capital in Puerto Rico. Do I have it right? I've never been to your town. But it's not a major city, right?__EOS__ No. No, it's not.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ It's not. It's a rural town, beautiful hills and mountains and very jungley in Puerto Rico. It's called Aguas Buenas, or good waters.",3,,903," The people who got into positions of influence, internationally, during the George W. Bush administration - and I'm referring here to positions pertaining to, you know, birth control and abortion - what happens now during the Obama administration? Do they - do new appointees replace them? __EOS__ Yes. The vast majority of those people who were appointees who will now be replaced. I mean, you know, one really good example is Mark Dybul who is the head of the president's global AIDS program, which is called PEPFAR. And Mark Dybul was not in many cases, you know, he didn't come from a conservative background but he proved very willing to, kind of, hew to the conservative line since that was the way to get Evangelicals invested into global AIDS programs, you know? So he was, you know, would often side with him against contraception and against various kind of woman's reproductive health issues. __EOS__ So you think that will be happening with other people too? __EOS__ Yeah absolutely. I think that, especially because so much of - so many of the people who make important decisions in this area are in the State Department. The fact that there's someone in the State Department who has made global women's rights a priority, it just has a kind of incalculable impact.

And if we do get birds in hand, then we try to make contact with that facility and transfer the birds to the rehabilitation folks. __EOS__ We were talking about the birds that have been affected.

You talk about how he then publishes a travelogue of his adventures, where he sort of fights off pirates, and it kind of captures the imagination of Victorian society. __EOS__ He was attacked by pirates, he was attacked by bandits, he encountered all kinds of disease and storms, and he also goes in Chinese disguise, dressed up as if he were a wealthy Chinese merchant. __EOS__ And this book that he publishes, the sort of diary of his exploits, make the rounds, and by 1848, he is approached by a representative from the East India Company, at the time, one of the most important, if not the most important, multinational corporation in the world. __EOS__ The East India Company says to him  We need you to go back to China and hunt up some tea for us. They wanted really good tea stock from the very best gardens in China, and they also needed experts.

I saw you in the pilot of ""The Rifleman."" You know, they were -maybe they still are rerunning it on the Family Channel. __EOS__ Wow. __EOS__ It's a really great series, and the episode you're in, you're like the kind of kid gunslinger who comes into town and you're a real showoff in it. __EOS__ You know who wrote that? Sam Peckinpah wrote the pilot for ""The Rifleman."" ",1,,908," No, about two years ago. __EOS__ Two years ago. And so were you on good terms when he... __EOS__ Yes. My father, as I said, I don't know if I said this in the book or not, but we worked out all our issues, and the issues we didn't work out I turned into a career. My father - yes. I think he was proud of me at the end. It took a while. We had - yes. We learned maturity is learning not to push each other's buttons. Everybody can do it. And it's either that or carry a verbal abuse whistle with you. So whenever they get on your nerves or you get on their nerves you blow the whistle and that makes them stop. __EOS__ Sorry.

Thanks for letting me speak up.__EOS__ We're talking with novelist Colum McCann about whether you tell - write about what you know; or try to find out about something you don't know, and write about that. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.__EOS__ Yes, hello.",0,,910," So I would have liked to have given an A to someone, and I think Bush I had the opportunity to earn it, and then gradually the situation deteriorated, and I'm afraid that right now we are facing a very serious crisis regarding the future, and the next 20 months are going to be absolutely decisive. __EOS__ There's an area of the world that you speak of, you write of, as the global Balkans, and it stretches from the Middle East off into western China, where there are Muslim minorities. The global Balkans, capable of what we saw in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s? __EOS__ Well, in essence, yes. You know, why are the Balkans considered to be a kind of the word that implies international trouble? Because essentially the European Balkans were a region in which internal strife in that region had a suction effect on external powers, and I argue in my book that the area from the Suez to St. John is today the modern equivalent of the Balkans, what I call the global Balkans, and today the United States is running a real risk if it is not prudent in the next 20 months of getting bogged down in a war that will cut across Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and then inevitably Pakistan, and if that happens to us, we'll be alone, and we'll be bogged down for at least 20 years. __EOS__ You write a great deal about the possibility of China and Russia developing a deeper strategic partnership and presenting real competition to the United States in that region and generally around the world. What evidence is there, first of all, that the Chinese and the Russians have overcome the mutual suspicions of the communist era? ",0,,911," Jason was dressed in a Palestinian kafia scarf and had sunglasses. He basically looked like a bad spy in a B movie. And he pretended to be a redneck American who didn't know anything about Iran and anything about the Middle East or Islam, and had all these stereotypes. And I was supposed to give him answers that, you know, that was so different from his prejudgments. __EOS__ Okay. So here, you're both at a coffee shop. And when this starts, Jason Jones is at a table looking for you and waiting for you. __EOS__   We headed to a coffee shop off Azadi Square for a clandestine meeting with Iranian journalist Maziar Bahari.

I love to tell stories of people involved in combat. I don't know how else to do it but to go out there and spend time with them. And so it's - I have never seriously considered retiring or saying, well, I'm too old to do this anymore. It does occur to me. It occurs to my wife and kids very often, but it's something that I've put my life into, I believe in strongly, I think it's important to tell these stories, and as long as I can keep doing it I will.  ",3,,913," Do you find you believe in the form now that you've been through so many? __EOS__ You know, with the over 2,000 submissions, a lot of them, they came across more like first sentences or just random thoughts. Or they were like, you know, last sentences. And the initial thought is that it's easy. 'Cause yeah, you should be able to sit down and write a sentence or two in a couple of seconds - that shouldn't be hard. __EOS__ Could you read that one to us? __EOS__ Sure. She  macular.

It's called ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Cooper plays Pat Solitano, just out of a psychiatric facility, struggling with bipolar disorder. Pat moves back home, where his parents try to manage his moods, like the night he wakes them up after he's just finished a Hemingway novel.",1,,917," I remember hearing a conversation between you and my colleague Scott Simon years ago, of course when you kind of first busted out, and it was this really funny story about how you first realized that you could sing. And you said that initially, you didn't realize you could sing.__EOS__ Yeah, it's a lot more after that, but that was pretty much how it began, really.__EOS__ When did you stop seeing your voice as odd?__EOS__ I still see my voice as odd. It never went away. Like we just did a song - a new song last week, and I was listening to my voice and I was like, God I wish - you know.",2,,918," Yeah, more - just improv. That's how I got the job, and it was a blast. It was two days work. He just said go nuts, so I did. Actually the costume helped. I think if I didn't have that mask on, you'd see I was bright red and embarrassed beyond comprehension.__EOS__ And was that as uncomfortable as it looked?__EOS__ Yes, very. The movie was filmed in a warehouse in Culver City.__EOS__ Not far from where we're sitting right now.",1,,919," And how many rounds did the Glock 17, the first Glock, hold?__EOS__ Yeah, coincidentally it holds 17 rounds in its magazine. I say coincidentally because most people think that's why it's called the Glock 17. Not so. Gaston Glock was a little bit eccentric in naming his guns, called his first basic pistol the 17 because it was his 17th patent, and he was very, very proud of that.__EOS__ So an Austrian named Gaston Glock, who isn't even in the gun business, decides to manufacture a gun from scratch to suit what the Austrian army needs, come up with the Glock 17, it works really well, and then U.S. law enforcement agencies start buying it, in part because the invention of the Glock coincides with a lot of American cops feeling outgunned by gangs and drug lords.__EOS__ Well, the first big element is the one you very correctly identified, which is he had just perfect timing. Gaston Glock was ready to come to the United States in 1986, 1987, and at precisely that time, particularly in many big cities, crack cocaine was creating a whole lot of violence on the street, particularly gun violence, and cops just felt that they were at a disadvantage. So timing was crucial.",0,,920,"  I'm exhausted just hearing--and we--now we didn't even take up      the list of lovers which also includes some pretty famous names--Tina      Onassis, Zsa Zsa Gabor, we could go on. __EOS__  Yeah.  Eartha Kitt, Eva Peron, Gene Tierney, Veronica Lake.      It's kind of amazing.  These women passed through his hands.  He had a      reputation as a dangerous man and a lover at a time when the idea of the      Latin playboy was in very high eclat in the United States and northern      Europe, and he--you know, this is a guy from the Dominican Republic.      This is not, you know, an heir to the Spanish throne or some Greek      shipping magnate.  He was born to no money.  And really his claim to      position was the fact that he was able to parlay one day's success into      the next day's. __EOS__  What did he have?  What was his fatal charm?  Give us some sense      of him. __EOS__  Well, there's a few things.  He was a true sportsman.  He      raced Formula One in Le Mans, Sebring.  He finished second at Sebring one      year when he raced for the Lancha Team.  He was a polo player; won      trophies on three continents.  He was by all accounts, men and women, a      completely charming conversationalist, a fine dancer, he spoke five      languages.  He was kind of ruggedly handsome.  More Humphrey Bogart than      Cary Grant.  One of the secrets of his successes hinted at in a song that      was popular during his heyday, a Latin song called ""Qu es el Tuyo,      Rubirosa?,"" ""What Is It That Rubirosa Has?,"" and when that moment in the      song was sung, men on the dance floor would grab their pants around their      knees, indicating a physical endowment that you couldn't talk about out      loud then or perhaps not even now, but which was legendary. ",0,,921," That's good. That's good.__EOS__ Tell me a little bit about this tune.__EOS__ There's two types of songs for me. It's like one that writes itself pretty much immediately, like I sang this melody out of my mouth exactly as it is first time. You know, and the lyrics came in, like, 10 minutes. It's just one of those songs that's so personal, it's just like cathartic - the process is. You know, so it's just kind of like a journal entry and it's really emotional.__EOS__  .",2,,922," You know, you're constantly judging people, and, you know, selfishly it will help me. But I just don't think that's a good way to live, you know, to judge people and to quote my boy Franny over there in Rome, who am I to judge?__EOS__ Oh, Pope Francis.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ I didn't know he was your boy. That's good to know.",1,,923,"  Jack Nasty.卿ｫYou didn't go up there to fish.卿ｫYou and him... __EOS__  Now, you listen to me.

But when you were able to vote, you registered as a Democrat, is that correct? __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And who was the first president you voted for? ",0,,925," Well, but, you know, what kind of quality of life would they have? And she said, in sort of a chiding tone  It's not up to us to define their quality of life. It's a very personal thing, and they decide. __EOS__ One of the things I really love, you know, you have a series of videos on The Huffington Post website, where your reporting series is. And in a video of Tyler Southern, you see him working out at Walter Reed. And one of the exercises he's doing, he's taking the stump of one of his arms, and that goes into a sling that's attached to basically a weight machine, and so he's exercising his torso by exercising the stump of his arm. __EOS__ A lot of the credit goes to the folks that design and fit the prosthetics. __EOS__ Absolutely, absolutely. ",3,,926," But I love that about him because he's never - whatever the cards he's dealt, however negative - whether he's living in financial destitution and squalor, or his socks are threadbare and he can't afford to get a new pair, he can improvise something. And he's always improvising some wonderful improvement on his lot, to turn a negative into a positive. __EOS__ So because I can't see you - Im in Washington; you're in New York - do you... __EOS__ I am wearing socks - but they were not painted on, if thats what you were going to ask. __EOS__ No, I was going to ask if you have a mustache. ",1,,927," Are they going to point their guns at little kids?__EOS__ ...No, you're not going to point - you need to ensure that you act as a backdrop to the border patrol who's, frankly, busy right now dealing with changing diapers and not doing with people who are coming in illegally of there're folks tried to break into our country. There are people who are trying to come. Let's stop them, let's put a spotlight on this. I think there's a humanitarian crisis, yes, but what gets me so upset about this is the president of the United States - he's going to meet with the president of Honduras and Guatemala this Friday. And the important thing here is, why hasn't he been speaking to them before and saying don't send your children here they're being raped they're being mistreated it's a dangerous journey, don't let them come here.__EOS__ Very briefly.__EOS__ Very quickly, again the president is doing everything he can within his current powers to deal with the situation and looking like a wide range of issues. The meeting that he's having this week with those leaders is important because they have the ability to send signals to their constituency to say, look this is a futile game.

Now they've got a bunch of people working in there with no benefits at $10 an hour. And then they come to the fulltime employees. They want you to contribute to the United Way. I told them  You're the reason we need the United Way. You're not paying a fair wage. So it all boils down to corporate greed.__EOS__ And how do they explain this to you?__EOS__ Well, they just tell us that it's easier to balance workload with production schedules and this and that. But every day, they're bringing in a new batch of people and paying them nine, $10 an hour.",0,,929," As opposed to like, he literally believed that there would be an apocalyptic end times and then a literal heaven. __EOS__ Right. There are scholars who want to see all of this talk about this coming judgment of the Earth, and the catastrophes that are going to happen, as pure metaphor. And I think the reason they want to see it that way is because if you think that Jesus literally thought that there was going to be a coming end of the age  well, it didnt happen. And so Jesus wouldve been wrong. And some scholars are uncomfortable with the idea that Jesus could be wrong. __EOS__ Im interested in what you think of the popularity of that point of view. Theres the Left Behind series of novels, which have sold a remarkable - I dont have the figures on hand, but like, tens of millions of copies. And thats a novel  a series of novels based on the apocalypse. A lot of people today believe in the Rapture, that the second coming of Jesus is imminent and the people who are believers will rise to heaven, will be raptured to heaven. And everybody else will be left behind to face the trials and tribulations and wars and plagues, and so on. And there are several very politically powerful people who believe that now. __EOS__ Yeah, thats right. And, you know, the Left Behind series sold far more copies than The Da Vinci Code. ",0,,930," Ben, I mean, you could have recreated these sounds in studios and nobody watching the movie would have known the difference. Why did you go to such great lengths to get the actual sounds of the actual things that Lincoln interacted with?__EOS__ I love American history, and I've always been a student of it. And in particular, I've been very interested in Lincoln. And so when this opportunity came up, I felt, well, here's a chance to get in touch with actual history. I always do research when you're collecting sounds and making sounds for a film. And authenticity is normally not necessarily the prime directive in doing sound design. You're always searching out sounds that have the right emotional impact, and they may not even be authentic at all. But for this film, I didn't want to make guesses. I wanted to essentially capture the spirit of what might have been. And it was inspiring to do so because when you go and record some of these things, you feel very close to the subject.__EOS__ I know this takes place in 1865, but were you ever tempted to just, you know, throw in a little light saber sound?__EOS__ No, I wasn't tempted to put a light saber in the film. It's true that I often might pay an homage to something by sneaking in a Wilhelm scream or a light saber or something. But this film was just too sacred. It wouldn't have been appropriate to do that.",1,,931," Yeah, I'm not a legal expert, and I think some of these issues are a little murky.

VCRs are going very      quickly out of mode, and what's going to happen is you're not going to      have a VCR to play the VHS tapes on.  And so what you want to do is copy      it on to a CD or a DVD, knowing then in 10 years you're probably going to      have to reduplicate it again on to the latest technology because CDs, in      and of themselves, and DVDs may last an incredibly long time.  The      equipment you need to play them on won't. __EOS__  Here's something interesting that I think record collectors      will enjoy in your book.  You write that vinyl records are actually the      most stable recording medium ever devised.

This doesn't make one say Britain is not a democracy, United States is      not a democracy; that's not the constructive way of looking at your      comment. __EOS__  What are the ways and means of      dealing with the African-American problem in America or with the Dalit      problem in India or with the immigrant problem in Europe?

And she joins us now from our bureau in New York. __EOS__ Thank you for inviting me. __EOS__ Now this isn't your first time taking on the standards. You released ""Dionne Warwick Sings Cole Porter"" back in 1990, and you've done a number of albums of film and Broadway music. What inspired this album? ",2,,952," Well, the problem is, as with many African countries, that its reputation is largely negative as far as the rest of the world is concerned. And what tends to happen when you have a country with a negative reputation and a country next door that shares the same name is that a lot of that negative reputation achieves the contagion effect. And if they can get away from that, it wouldn't be a bad thing to do.__EOS__ Well, one proposal I've seen for a name for the independent country, should there be one, is Nile. What do you think?__EOS__ I think the Egyptians might have a thing or two to say about that.__EOS__ Which reminds us of the problem of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which is now just Republic of Macedonia, something that the Greeks did not like at all.",3,,953,"  And what if it isn't?__EOS__  Everything will be all right in the end. And if it's not all right, then it is not yet the end.__EOS__  Sonny.__EOS__  It will succeed. It has to.",1,,954,"   Now you may not be with me, but your fragrance      fills the room.  Oh, just think of me, baby, 'cause I'll be thinking of      you. __EOS__  Campbell was a child of the Mississippi Delta.  His father, Big      Milton, was a farmer and local blues musician.  Little Milton picked up      his first guitar at the age of 12.  By his teens, he was impressing blues      fans around Mississippi.  Little Milton's recording career began when Ike      Turner introduced him to Sam Phillips of Sun Records.  By the late '50s,      Little Milton had founded his own label, Bobbin Records. __EOS__   We may not have a cent to pay the rent, but      we're going to make it.  I know we will.  We may have to eat beans every      day, but we're going to make it.  I know we will. __EOS__  Forty years ago, he recorded ""We're Gonna Make It.""  That song      became an anthem for the civil rights movement.  It was his first number      one hit. Over the years, Little Milton continued to tour and record,      playing to sold-out crowds across the United States and Europe.  In 2000,      he received a Grammy nomination for his album ""Feel It."" ",2,,955," What's your favorite Chrysler car, or what kind of a car would like to see Chrysler build now? Email us, talk@npr.org. Later in the program we'll talk with auto critic Dan Neil. __EOS__ Hi, Neal. How are you? __EOS__ And I know you've covered Cerberus extensively, what's in this for them? __EOS__ Cerberus is one big enigma, I think, to even observers of the private equity community. It's a super exclusive, elusive, private equity fund that was started with all of $10 million in 1992. And shift to 2007, they have $25 billion in capital. You can barely find a photo of its founder, much less a video. They're super exclusive, they have this kitchen cabinet of former cabinet officialsダﾝ ",3,,956,"  Okay, Drew, this is how most people live. See, because of your whole, you know, Disney prince thing... __EOS__  Actually, they used footage of me from my high school swim team to draw Prince Eric. __EOS__  Right. Because of that, you live in a bubble where people do what you want and tell you what you want to hear. __EOS__  Oh, I dont think that's true. ",1,,957," Yes. I was very interested in vaudeville. It was the only sort of discipline that was a five-minute act on stage, which is what I really enjoyed and saw myself doing. And I bought books on it. I went to the Long Beach Pike, which was a carnival fair, you know for - it's really a place for drunken sailors to get tattoos. But there was also side shows. I was very interested in that. You know, there was these - oh, and there were these short acts.__EOS__ But what you were doing, I think, is not only making comedy out of nothing but making comedy out of people's expectations, which you were going to fail to fulfill.__EOS__ Well yes, exactly. And I really started that when I became a semi-professional, meaning I was working the local folk-music clubs, going around either working for free or for a week.__EOS__ With such weird, you know, like, bad material because some of the material was, like, consciously not funny.",3,,958," Right. His day name. Well, G. Love is somebody who's a big blues fan and has been. He also has his own take on performing and his style, he's very much at the forefront of what he's doing. But I've always felt this underlying blues passion in him, perhaps from the same place that mine comes from. __EOS__ Do we hear his influence on one particular song or another on this CD? __EOS__ Well, ""I'm Tore Down"" is his sort of gift to me of a song I recorded years ago from a Freddy King tune that I got. So he sort of included the blues and the hip hop and everything into one take and it was great. __EOS__ Let's listen to it. ",2,,959," And highest-paid... __EOS__ I was the highest-paid stuntman in the world. __EOS__ I know that means a lot to you.

Actually, preparing to play this piece today, we hadn't seen each other for, I don't know, a couple of months probably, something like that, and hadn't played together much for quite some time. So, we got together yesterday and played. And it took a couple of minutes to warm up. __EOS__ Well, we're all looking forward to hearing what you're going to play for us in the studios of Minnesota Public Radio. It's a tune that's called ""Attahasa."" And before we hear it - it's going to take us out - let me thank you both for appearing on the program. First, Steve Tibbetts, thank you so much. __EOS__ Well, thanks for having us. __EOS__ And Mark Anderson, thanks to you. ",2,,963, No.__EOS__ Never. That never really happens.__EOS__ That's not really.

This is just their life. Like we cook together - mostly her.,2,,964,"  You've fallen once, you'll fall again. And lean on...__EOS__ Over the course of a few weeks, started playing with it and then wrote a melody to it. And then Chris Bear played these kind of strange jazz chords at one point, and I went over and recorded those. Then we incorporated that into the middle of the song. And it just kind of kept developing in this weird way. And then Chris Taylor took it, kept kind of chipping away at it and adding bits here and there.__EOS__  Look on your face. The burden's on your back. The sun is in your eyes. Stretched out, far and wide. The light that scorched the sand...__EOS__ As you guys get - have been getting more popular, we're sitting here, you have two sold-out shows in Washington, D.C. Jay-Z came to one of your concerts.

I hear lion roaring in my ear. __EOS__ Lion, lion what do you hear? I hear a hippopotamus snoring in my ear. ",0,,967,"  My dad was a member of the Rat Pack, yeah.  And they used      to do a show up there at the Sands--Frank, my father, Dean Martin, Sammy      Davis and Joey Bishop.  And I was five years old when I walked on the set      and I saw my father dressed up as a cowboy and I thought, `How do I do      that for the rest of my life?' __EOS__  Did you adore him? __EOS__  Yeah.  My dad was, like--had the heart of a kid.  He got a      really big life and a very complicated life.  And, you know, it's hard to      manage that kind of stuff sometimes, especially if all you really want to      do is surf.  My dad and I, you know, did a lot of nonsense together in      the '70s. I came out here when I was 20 and spent time with him and it      was a different time and, you know, we got high together.  So my dad      didn't have a whole lot of skills in the parenting department, you know. __EOS__  And your mother, what was she like? ",3,,968,"  A symphony based on something from American culture, I hope not.  Then too many people will try it. __EOS__  OK.  I noticed you said ""American culture,"" and not the Grateful Dead.  So like Aaron Copland taking Shaker melodies. __EOS__  Well, there's more than one that have participated in this tradition of exploring your time, your place.  I think what the Grateful Dead did is so much a part of more than one generation that it's long overdue to be taken as a phenomenon beyond the music itself.  And in my case, out came a symphony. __EOS__  You're a Deadhead, aren't you?  I wasn't expecting that. ",2,,969," The critical aspect of training that they need to bring back to their units, is that they are the trainers of the young Jundies, of the young privates and they have to believe in that and they have to assume that role as the trainers. It cannot be the junior officers, which it has been for so many years, and it cannot be the senior officers, which it has been for so many years. It has to be the junior noncommissioned officer that steps up and assumes the role as the trainer and takes responsibility. __EOS__ When you first got there when this training first started out, what were the weak spots that you found with the Iraqi's who were coming to you to be trained as noncommissioned officers? __EOS__ One of the things that the past units had not been training is what we call the warrior task, the U.S. Army combative, pugil training. __EOS__ Pugil training? ",3,,970," This question of turf, I was reading a comment from another writer on baseball etiquette, Michael Duca, who said  Bob Gibson, the legendary pitcher, was very well worst in protecting what he called his office. Had that been Gibson on the mound, A-Rod would have picked himself off the grass to get back to... __EOS__ Denny McLain would have done the same thing. There are a lot of old school pitchers, including a lot of Yankees that would never have allowed that. __EOS__ A-Rod's got to have some defenders here, though, people just saying it's the most direct route. What's the big deal? __EOS__ Because it's actually  it'll actually hurt  in the long run, it'll probably actually hurt A-Rod because, just because of the fact that now -they lost the triple play last night. ",3,,971," Right.__EOS__ Would never care what you said.__EOS__ And if people aren't into you, you know, don't like something, I mean what is that? I said this in the Times the other day - you can only offend me if you mean something to me. You can't break up with me if we didn't date, OK?__EOS__ There's a lot of people proclaiming the breakup, but, dude, you know, hey, we didn't date, we didn't go out.",1,,972," Well, I once played at some concerts with a jazz guitarist, Barney Castle, and Barney did the introductions. He was very, very eloquent. So, he said, we jazz guys, we take a tune and we add all these other notes and things and play completely differently. And the classical guys, they take the tune, they play the same notes and they work really hard to make it sound completely fresh every night. __EOS__ Even in Bach's time there was a premium on the ability to improvise and embellish and make things fresh. And, I don't know, maybe when you have a perfect melody you don't actually want to do this. But, you know, you do have to make it your own. I have to play, though, some pieces where you have taken - it sounds like you've taken - a few more liberties. Let's hear this one by Jacques de Saint-Luc. __EOS__ I mean, what is that and how much of what we're hearing is 300 years old and how much is 2008, David Russell? __EOS__ A lot of it is my improvisation. I'm not a great improviser on the baroque style but all the ornamentation is mine. ",2,,973," And it's just the whole idea of what is the box? Why is it here? How is it doing? And why are these people OK with the box because, clearly, this flouts everything that this person, Andrew Dahl, knows about the scientific process; examination, everything. It's just out the window, put it into the box. And it's intentionally in the book. Again, not a spoiler. It looks like a microwave. And that's the whole point of it. It's just to drive him a little bit crazy because he knows this is not right. And that's really his first indication that the world in which he exists has just suddenly gone awry.__EOS__ And because the magic box will spit out an answer five minutes before the deadline, that needs one more tweak.__EOS__ Exactly, because it has to go up to the bridge. It has to go to the science officer. And because the science officer is an important character, you can't have the whole thing solved by people in the background. It has to go to the science officer, and they have to say, oh, but there's this one thing that we couldn't solve. And he can go, well, clearly, you need to move this peptide bond for them. And then everybody goes, that's brilliant. You're brilliant, sir. Why, thank you.__EOS__ Science-fiction writers, clearly, you have an interesting relationship with ""Star Trek"" and other television series, and I guess movies too.",0,,974," Michael Gordon, had you talk with General Shinseki? __EOS__ No. He doesn't do interviews on this. But I think he's trying to. But I think he understands that his analysis has been vindicated and he wasn't the only one. You know, in the book we recount an episode. The day before General Shinseki goes up to the Hill, which again was not on this subject, he offered these thoughts in response to a question about which the Senators didn't not follow up, by the way. And the day before, he saw a General who was working on the post-war planning, Steve Hawkins, one star general. And he told Shinseki his internal analysis was that he needed 350,000 troops. So when Shinseki made these comments, he was aware that this reflected some internal planning estimates by Army officials out in the theatre. __EOS__ Lou, thanks very much for the call. You're calling from Roda, Spain. Are you still on active service? __EOS__ No. I'm retired and just soaking up the sun. ",0,,975,  What is the book? Are you shy about your book?__EOS__  No.__EOS__  Is it - is it racy?__EOS__  Racy?,1,,976," And that's Woody, that's Woody.__EOS__ I didn't get everything at first, and I didn't take them out all the time. I always kind of tried to leave one in. But so, you know, a lot of times, particularly the things that June - that's the lady that plays my wife in the movie - or that Will Forte would say to me, I would just get or not get. And if I didn't get them, a lot of the huh has come from the fact that what are they really trying to say.__EOS__ That's all fine, but what else are you doing? What are you doing in 2013?__EOS__ Do you think that you're getting to the age where you fear people think that of you sometimes, that you're not - that you're not getting it?",1,,977,"  Highway always looks the same, but the mountains never seem so far away. Highway flowers... __EOS__ But sometimes there seems to be almost a disjoint between really rich melodies and the sort of yearning lyrics. Were you deliberately sort of playing those two things off against each other? __EOS__ I was in at least one case that I can think of, on the first song on the record, These Things. The feeling and the lyrical content is pretty achy, but the music is pretty lighthearted, I think, and novel. __EOS__  I'm looking still, sunshine, uphill. I'm looking still 'til I might find you these things will do. ",2,,978," For their 10th anniversary, The Parrots put out their own album of live Beatles covers on Sony Records. __EOS__  You think you lost your love, when I saw her yesterday. It's you she's thinking of and she told me what to say. She says she loves you and you know that can't be bad. Yes, she loves you and you know you should be glad. She said you her so she almost lost her mind. But know she said she knows. You're not the hurting kind. She says she loves you and you know that can't be bad. Yes, she loves you and you know you... __EOS__ So why are these tribute bands such a big deal here? __EOS__ This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",2,,979," And, you know, it was Mouse, so it wasn't a gentle dislodgement.__EOS__ We've walked a couple of miles, on a lot of the streets Mosley knew intimately as a teen. The route has included a couple of Easy's houses, the junior high Mosley attended, and the real sites on which several imaginary buildings appear in his books. We prepare to part ways, but before we do, a final surprise  Mosley stops in front of a pink fourplex with fancy diamond-paned windows.__EOS__ So this is the house my parents owned, the front and the back. We lived in the back. It's a great place, I love it.__EOS__ And it's just around the corner from Easy's house. Once again, Easy Rawlins and Walter Mosley intersect. If you ask Mosley how much of him is in Easy, he pauses before answering.",0,,980," So your voice has a kind of hoarseness to it. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ A little raspy. Was it always that way or is that related to the drugs that you did back then or to the cancer that you had after that? __EOS__ You know, it's a little tough to pin down, because I smoked on and on all my life, tobacco, so a lot of people who smoke tobacco sound like me. When you smoke cocaine you're taking in vapors that are coming into your lungs at a really high temperature, and so could that have made a problem? I took, I had Hodgkin's lymphoma and I took a lot of radiation to the mouth and throat, so could it have been that? I mean I have, I walk around and you can see in the movie, ""Page One,"" I walk around with my neck bent, that's from the muscles sort of getting shot out by all the radiation. But I will tell you something interesting though. I spent a couple weeks working 9/11, you know, working the pile, just my job was to cover fireman. I never had a hoarse voice before that. ",3,,981," ...To a young, harscrabble America. But apparently he is also in addition to writing the Declaration of Independence, the father macaroni cheese in this country.__EOS__ He is. He brought in macaroni from his travels in Europe and liked to eat it with a cheese sauce. He wasn't maybe the first person, but he definitely popularized it. And it reminds you of the song ""Yankee Doodle."" He put the feather in his cap and called it macaroni. Now, why is that - why would you call a feather in your hat macaroni? It's because macaroni was a code word for a Dandee. So when the British soldiers came to the British colonies and they thought everybody was so rustic, they made fun of them by saying that all they did was stick a feather in their hat and thought they were macaroni.__EOS__ I realized a couple years ago, our daughters are growing saying pasta.__EOS__ Right.",0,,982," ...with that one.__EOS__ Well, it is a conundrum. I mean, on one hand I want to say I'm not going and, you know, you can go to hell, you guys. But that's not helping anybody who is gay or transgender over there. I've been going to Russia since I was - in 1979. I've been going quite frequently and I've always had a wonderful rapport with the Russian audiences and with the Russian people. And, you know, there are a lot of great Russian people out there who are outraged by what is going on, but they don't have - I don't want to abandon them.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ Now I'm going to - I'll probably get criticized for going and I can understand that. It's just I, as a gay man, and a gay musician, cannot stay at home and not support these people who have been to lots of my concerts in the past. I'm aware of the situation and I will be diplomatic. I'm not going to Russia and, you know, tell them to go to hell and think - that's not the way things are done. You chip away at something and you hope that there will be dialogue and that the situation can get better. You don't just go in there with guns blazing and say well, to hell with you because they're going to say to hell with you and get out of the country. That's not going to solve anything. But if I can go there and maybe I can talk to some people in the administration and, you know, I was...",2,,983," That's paradoxical enough. __EOS__ But only a neurotic cares if everyone like them, you know? And in show business, certainly, it is a - politics, it's all the same thing. You have to get people to like you. And by writing books, by making movies and everything, I think you're continuing to do that. And a crowded funeral is a nice thing. I like that. But the older you get, the less chance that has of happening. That's another reason to make younger friends. __EOS__ So they can fill in, like at the Oscars when somebody goes to the bathroom, they have somebody to sit in the seat. I want them at the funeral. __EOS__ Since you write about your mustache in the book, I feel like I should ask you about it. You know, we've talked many times over the years, but I don't think we've really talked about your mustache technique. ",0,,984," Well, it could be that they couldn't find my door. But Marvel actually came to my agent, Chuck Verrill a few years ago and said, is there anything that he would be interested in? And at that time, ""The Dark Tower"" story was done, and I - people have asked me all the time, is there going to be a movie of it? And I never thought that there would be because it's very, very long. And to do something like that, it would almost have to be a trilogy. And the chances of actually doing that, I think - you know, a thing like ""The Lord of the Rings,"" New Line Cinema pretty much bet their studio on that, and they succeeded. But other trilogies - hmm - just haven't been trilogies. They've been like one-shots and then it just kind of goes away and like, ""His Dark Materials,"" the Philip Pullman thing. __EOS__ Well, you might be selling it short a little bit. I've never seen a movie quite as beautiful as the illustrations Jae Lee did for this. It's really a gorgeous book. Obviously, you don't draw them. You don't even write them. So what is your role you see in the comic books? __EOS__ Well, we sat down at the beginning and they said, we really want to do this. What should we do? And to me, the respect that I got from these people at Marvel was terrific. Because when you're involved with Hollywood, sometimes people will ask you what you want to do. You give them your two cents worth and they go away. And if you're lucky, the check doesn't bounce. So that's the way that it works. But these people really wanted direction. __EOS__ To fill in the spaces. ",0,,985,"  So you can extrapolate from there where The Knux and the Cool Kids and the Kid Sister will be musically 10 years from now.   __EOS__  Yeah, it's almost like it raises the question, is this a phenomenon in hip hop or is there a meta template that has to do with the way popular music works in this culture from going - from in significance to, you know, amphitheaters.   __EOS__  All right, I'm going to play one more clip from The Knux, it's called ""Fire."" __EOS__   Let's do it.  You know I got the fire.  You know we want some cash.  Wait down we need to yell ...

But once Augusto Pinochet took over, Jara's outspoken support for the former socialist government made him a threat. He was hunted down, captured and tortured.",2,,987," Well, it's basically French dance hall music from the first half of the 20th century. And its lead - accordion is the lead instrument. Guitar is also very important. And one of the standard forms in this type of music is the waltz. And to us, as Americans, it sounds iconically French. But then if you look beneath the surface, it actually has a very multicultural family tree.__EOS__ And the tradition that Django Reinhardt was from?__EOS__ Exactly. His first gig was playing banjo in a musette dance band.__EOS__ Banjo. Wow. Oh, you have banjo - your guitar player, Matt Munisteri, plays banjo on some of the tracks...",2,,988," Well, I would call what they want more of a civil union than a marriage. In my world - again, I think we started talking about this - using my religious terms, versus, maybe what we have is something else. And I think people have the right to live together with whoever they want to live with, but marriage as I understand it, is an architectural blueprint given to us by God to produce certain outcomes that two men or two women cannot really produce.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ And other issues happening right now.__EOS__ But what does that - so what do you envision if more people are allowed to marry who are of the same gender? What is it that you think is going to happen? Since people are already doing that. I mean, people are already partnered, but even for years, for decades - those are the litigants in this case are people who have been together for decades and say that they - you know, what do you envision will happen?",3,,989," The next song you have for us here, I'm told, is ""Comatose.""__EOS__  Baby, I don't really know if I'm lying to you, or hiding the truth from myself.

The most well-known is diabetes, which takes a terrible toll on human health and well-being. But heart disease is also a consequence of obesity. Cancer, a certain number of cancers are affected by obesity.__EOS__ Now, we know, and the documentary makes the point, that obesity, that being overweight is a function of both genetics and the environment. And, you know, the genetics of the human race I don't think have changed significantly since the 1980s. But something has obviously changed a lot in our environment. What are some of the big things that have driven the increase in obesity?__EOS__ Genetics may help explain why one person has more of a problem than another might, given the same environment, but it's clearly the environment that's driving this problem. And we could count 100 ways or more that the environment has changed, in ways that I call toxic. Serving sizes have increased.__EOS__ You've described the ads that are aimed at kids as powerful, pernicious and predatory. Does advertising work on kids in a different way than the rest of us?",3,,993,"  He walked past neighbors' houses. He walked barefoot down Route 22. He walked past the supermarket - empty parking lot and an eerie glow. He walked past the Korean Baptist church and the Saks-anchored mall into the dreams of late-night drivers who took home the image of some addled derelict in a cotton robe menacing the soft shoulder. He looked down at his legs. It was like watching footage of legs walking from the point of view of the walker. That was the helplessness. This was the terror  the brakes are gone, the steering wheel has locked. I am at the mercy of this wayward machine. __EOS__ And often what happens is these episodes come in freezing cold weather. His wife, Jane, does this to try to help him. She packs up a survival backpack. She puts all kinds of stuff in it - a GPS device, energy bars, a first-aid kit, because when he starts walking, he can't turn back. She wants him to have this pack on him all the time. __EOS__ He has no control over where his body is taking him, and he has no control over where, eventually, his body will release him. And when it releases him, he has no energy to do anything but collapse in exhaustion. So it falls to his wife to take care of him and pick him up wherever he might be. __EOS__ And he and his wife both seek all sorts of medical insight. They go to the Mayo Clinic and see all kinds of doctors. He gets MRIs. He takes bat wing extract at some point, but nothing can be determined. This is an unnamed illness. And there, of course, is the title of your book. ",0,,994," A few other people have said it. You know, once you want to be put in a museum, rock and roll is over. You know, it's not voted by fans. It's voted by people who induct you, or others, people who are already in it. I'm not even sure, but whoever voted, I just don't think they could have said no anymore. I don't think they really do want us in there, to be honest with you. __EOS__ You had Johnny Lydon on your show, and he said something along the lines of, well, back when you were playing, and you were the Sex Pistols, the record industry didn't want to have anything to do with you. And so now, you know, why would you want to have anything to do with them? __EOS__ Well, when we first started, we were the ones basically calling the shots, because the record industry didn't know what to do with us. They didn't know what it was, because they, it wasn't something you can bottle up, like Green Day, like you can now. Oh, we know where to put that, like every record label wants their next big thing. You know? __EOS__ So you will, in absentia, be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. ",2,,995," This is this very raw emotional scene and then this guy, later in the movie, takes this information and uses it against him - without giving too much away - this is a bad guy.__EOS__ The sense of the story is that the doppelganger does the thing that would be the worst thing that Simon could imagine. And there's no real logic to it, but you just have this sense of - I don't know - inevitability and it feels kind of psychologically right and also funny, hopefully.__EOS__ You got a lot of notoriety in the U.K. for playing this really insecure computer nerd in a British hit TV show called ""The IT Crowd."" And your films often seem to be about someone who's been crippled by anxiety and self-doubt. And I wonder if that's something that you have had to grapple with personally.__EOS__ I think everyone has some self-doubt, otherwise, you know, you're sociopath. But it's interesting to look at characters who have a problem and don't know what to do about it.",1,,996," Well, thank you very much for that, Danielle. And it's fair to say yes, the Yankees, major contributors to charity, but as are other clubs. Charlie Pierce, you think of the Jimmy Fund in Boston.__EOS__ Yeah, I think that, you know, this is something, to whom much is given, much, you know, is required. And I think that the Yankees contribute to the community. It's only fair, since the community helped build them a wonderful new baseball stadium, among other things.__EOS__ Many hundreds of millions of dollar. They've done it a couple times now. I'm actually very disappointed to hear that the Yankees are generous to charitable organizations because that kind of deprives the last 64 years of my life of meaning.__EOS__ I want to think they're terrible.",0,,997,"  Max me. You don't  I see that max standing on my , man. __EOS__  Stone. __EOS__  I'll see you outside before you see me. __EOS__  Stone. ",1,,998," So what's The Four Lovers sound like? What was the repertoire like?__EOS__ The repertoire that I remember early on was one of the songs that is in the show - ""Moody's Mood For Love"" - which was a big revelation for me about Frankie's range and what he could do and so on and so forth. So that was an inspirational moment for me, but they did some rockabilly songs. They've done some, you know - Frankie knows a lot of country stuff.__EOS__ So what made you realize that what you should do is capitalize on Frankie Valli's falsetto? Because he wasn't always singing in falsetto. I mean, he wasn't constantly singing in falsetto.__EOS__ No, he wasn't. He just stunned me with his ability the type of falsetto. It wasn't just that he could sing in falsetto because there were innumerable groups from the '50s that did soft R&B falsetto, you know, Smokey Robinson style. Many of the early doo-wop groups did that style of singing, and Frankie could do that. But he could do that with an edge and no break between his full voice and his falsetto. And if you really didn't pay attention, you wouldn't know the difference. You know, of course when you get up there, you get up there, but he can cross over without too much notice. So that was interesting for me. He could jump back and forth, and I had no boundaries to write.",2,,999," My guest is Sean Wilentz. He's a professor of history at Princeton University. His article in the New Yorker is titled ""Confounding Fathers  The Tea Party's Cold War Roots."" More after a break. This is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Sean Wilentz. He's a professor of history at Princeton University, and he has a piece in the current edition of the New Yorker called ""Confounding Fathers  The Tea Party's Cold War Roots."" __EOS__ Well, you know, I mean, Beck is one among many. Beck is not the only conservative, right-wing conservative out there these days, any more than Welch and Skousen were the only right-wing conservatives out there in the '50s and '60s. __EOS__ Before we get to that question that you just raised, give us an example of an idea or a conspiracy theory that you've heard Glenn Beck discuss that you think connects to the John Birch Society of the '50s. ",3,,1000," So, wait, you would take the makeup off?__EOS__ Oh yeah.__EOS__ When you go to Starbucks, you don't wear the hat?__EOS__ Absolutely not. No, no.",2
