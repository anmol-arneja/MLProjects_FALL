50000," Sometimes the wife of the rabbi would often serve as, like you said, the female presence - answering questions that may be sensitive to women and that a woman would want to share with another woman. Many communities, especially in 2013, we see often that the wives of rabbis nowadays are very busy with their own professions, and that is a role that is certainly sometimes still present but changing in many ways.__EOS__ So, I was going to ask you that -  is it that the wives of rabbis are not as interested in playing this role, or is it that congregations desire that a person fulfilling this role have the kind of training that a rabbi has?__EOS__ I think the way that Yeshiva Maharat is different is that we seek to formalize that position. In other words, it's wonderful if, you know, there are wives of rabbis in the community and women who are educated and who want to get involved - that's fantastic and that should not stop. But what we also want to do is to provide a comprehensive training for women who do want to serve formally in these capacities, who do want to be employed by the synagogue, and to really be fully prepared for that role. And what we've seen is that synagogues, like I said, they really - they desire that. They crave that presence.__EOS__ We do understand that, though there is some controversy about Yeshiva Maharat and the position in general. That there are some people within orthodoxy who still don't think it's appropriate for people to be trained in this way or to serve in this way. I'm wondering why that is, given that, as you've mentioned, that women have served informally in this role - often the wife of the rabbi, the rebbetzin, has served in that role. Why do you think that there's this pushback?",3
50001,"  I can't get over the fact that a youngster sitting there that day grows up to serve - become the second-longest-serving justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.__EOS__  Well, I can either.__EOS__ John Paul Stevens, now retired from the U.S. Supreme Court. His new book, ""Six Amendments  How And Why We Should Change The Constitution."" Mr. Justice, thanks so much for being with us.__EOS__ Well, thank you for inviting me.",0
50002," I had one kind of like piece of information in my pocket, which is that Rich had this fabulous lie and truth that he kept telling them at the same time  I don't know, I'm here with you. You know, they would ask questions, where is your crew. I don't know. He did know where they were. But the - that was a lie. But he'd also say, but I'm here with you. What's wrong with your ship? I don't know. I'm here with you. What's happening? I don't know. I'm here with you. That got played again and again and again because look, the lines went right out the window, the pacing went right out the window. There was no rhyme or reason to it. And I have to say, these guys were so good - the two Barkhads and Mahat and Faysal - that moments came out that did not exist even in the imagination of everybody involved in the movie. This particularly when Moussy, Barkhad Abdi says hey, I'm the captain now. That wasn't in the screenplay. That just came out because we were riding the ups and downs of the scene that suddenly had no rules.__EOS__ Wow. You know, as we talk about these intense scenes, this would be a good moment, I think, to talk a little bit about Paul Greengrass' - your method of filming. And Paul Greengrass, I know that you began as a journalist making documentaries. And I read a fascinating piece about as you got into feature films you had to learn kind of all of the techniques and language of feature filmmaking.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ But if, what I've read is right, you've evolved to the point where you don't do it in the conventional ways - where you have, you know, dollies and specific kind of markers and points from which the action is shot, and the actors all know that and they're hitting their marks.",3
50003, The victim is an immigrant from Budapest. His face is bloodied. His eyeglasses are busted. __EOS__ What was he wearing? Do you remember? __EOS__ No. He did it so quickly. I don't know. __EOS__ Connelly watches the cops who arrive on the scene to take the man's report and the paramedics who bandage his head. ,0
50004," But first, you have to learn to play it. __EOS__ I actually never had touched the drums in my life. But maybe the singing helped me a little bit with the rhythm and the timing. __EOS__ Actor Haas Sleiman, who's originally from Lebanon says it was easy to connect with his character. __EOS__ Tarek's path - like he moved from Syria to Michigan and then from Michigan to New York to pursue music, and I did exactly the same only like from Lebanon to Michigan and then to New York to pursue as a recording artist, so I thought that was like one of those things where you think like the planets are aligned in some way. ",3
50005," In the earlier days of, say, the mid-'90s and into the later '90s, I think that Fannie Mae was still pretty much on the up and up and not really buying the most sketchy loans. So there weren't a lot of subprime loans being made after 1990 - say, between 1998 and 2000, maybe 2001. But it did have, as its biggest supplier, almost, throughout this period, Countrywide Financial, which became one of the most - the biggest purveyors of toxic mortgages across the country. __EOS__ And the head of Fannie Mae, James Johnson, had a special relationship with Angelo Mozilo, the executive of Countrywide, too. __EOS__ Yes. James Johnson understood that Countrywide was a comer, was a very aggressive, strappy company founded by an entrepreneur with a chip on his shoulder, not your typical banker. And James Johnson set about to really cultivate Mr. Mozilo and to make sure that Fannie Mae was the biggest recipient of Countrywide loans. He didn't want Countrywide selling its loans to Freddie Mac, the competitor of Fannie Mae. __EOS__ We're speaking with Gretchen Morgenson. Her new book, with Joshua Rosner, about the origins of the financial crisis is called ""Reckless Endangerment."" ",0
50006," The single experience that probably led me to start Cultures in Harmony was actually just five days after 9/11 at the 69th Regiment Armory, when I performed for soldiers as they were coming back from a long day of rescue and cleanup work at Ground Zero. __EOS__ We have another From The Top alum waiting in the wings, violinist Maya Shankar was barely a teenager when she played ""La Campanella"" by Paganini, accompanied by Christopher O'Riley at the piano. __EOS__ Maya Shankar is now 23 and she joins us from the studios of member station WNKU in Highland Heights, Kentucky. Hello, Maya. __EOS__ Hello. Thanks for having me. ",2
50007," He's the person we see most of in this film, and he seems to have made the transition pretty well, from a wild and crazy young guy to daddy.__EOS__ He's made it pretty well, but it's been a struggle. It's really hard to go out and yell the band's anthem, ""F Authority,"" and then come home and be the ultimate authority in his house.__EOS__ Yes. We're talking about not just the language of the performance, the look of the performance, the tattoos that go along with being a punk rock musician, the attitude towards society. It's a pretty sharp turn one has to make to start socializing one's children.__EOS__ It is. But what I discovered in doing this film and didn't expect at all - I was really just thinking of it more as a potential comedy. What I discovered was that a lot of these guys were really devastated by their own fathers. And when handed a child, suddenly that all came rushing to the forefront, and they felt like they had to truly be there in a way that their parents weren't. And in many ways, that was the reason for the strength of their early rebellion.",1
50008," Mir Hossein Mousavi, the presidential candidate, since the election, he has been under house arrest for questioning the Iranian government for the result of the election, almost three years now.__EOS__ So you have an essay here by his daughter, Zahra, called ""The Collage that is My Father."" Tell us about this essay.__EOS__ It was very difficult to find Mousavi's daughter in Iran. We know that she is under a lot of pressure not to talk to the media. We knew that she does not write for any publications, and - but we tried, and it paid off.__EOS__ It's very, very poignant. And she talks about her father's patience. She says  He is so patient, it would frustrate us. He would tell us that he even forgets his deepest hurts within the first half-hour and for us to practice forgetting too. He always volunteered to ask for forgiveness, and he counseled patience. We must pass and endure patience, patience, patience. Is that hard for you to hear - patience, patience, patience?",0
50009," Well, I think the Republicans started off from the very beginning trying to make sure there was no bill so that Obama, the Democrats would be blamed for failure. And if there was a bill, they would try to stir people up so that they wouldnt like it and they would blame the Democrats for a bill that they might not like in one respect or another. __EOS__ Through what's called reconciliation. Can the Democrats get a health care bill through the Congress with less than 60 votes in the Senate by using whatever their procedure is of reconciliation? If the poll still show the public opposed to that bill, that is, do you need to see some kind of revival in public opinion of support for what Democrats want in the way of health care in order to proceed further? __EOS__ I think polls reflect public opinion at the moment those polls were taken. And I think the public was outraged at Nebraska getting a special deal, somebody else getting a hospital, the people were going have to pay taxes on their health insurance. And that drove them over the edge after being pounded by the anti-health care propaganda that the political right wing have been funding. __EOS__ So if thats the case and those things were taken out of the bill, then you should see result in polls changing and... ",3
50010," My mosque, no, because we were primarily a Sufi mosque. Very few - I mean, I really don't - most of the people who came to our mosque really came to discharge their obligations of the Friday prayer and were spiritually motivated and really were more concerned about how can I know God, how can I really taste God and experience the reality of God.__EOS__ In your attempt to create not only an interfaith community but an American Islam, you want women to have, you know, more equality. And so women in your mosque were in the main section. They were not put in back. They were not behind a curtain. But they did sit separately from the men, and I guess in reading your book I was wondering why although including women in the main section you still separated the men and women.__EOS__ Women prefer to be separated from the men because the nature of our prayers is very, you know, very intimate. We stand next to each other in rows. We're in contact with each other. We bend down. We prostrate, you know, I mean - people don't like to see a man, like, staring at their behind, that kind of stuff. So...__EOS__ You know, I really never thought of it that way.",3
50011," Exactly. So who is the master?__EOS__ So it's like he's controlling you and your controlling Freddy. Yeah. Yeah.__EOS__ Yes. Paul is the master and I'm happily a member of his cult.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Amy Adams and she's one of the stars of the new Paul Thomas Anderson film ""The Master."" She's also currently in theaters starring with Justin Timberlake and Clint Eastwood in ""Trouble with the Curve.""",1
50012," That's just the Western ones. Then, when you start putting a board together all the Japanese robots - oh, my gosh.__EOS__ So Don Hall went looking for inspiration. He visited MIT, Harvard and Carnegie Mellon.__EOS__ I was on the hunt for a robot that could be very appealing but also huggable.__EOS__ Huggable because ""Big Hero 6"" is something of a love story. More about that later. At Carnegie Mellon, he scored.",1
50013," Aaron Paul, speaking with Terry Gross, recorded last November. Paul stars in the HBO series ""Breaking Bad."" That's the AMC series ""Breaking Bad."" Its fifth and final season premieres Sunday. Aaron Paul will be back in the second half of the show. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies filling in for Terry Gross. Let's get back to Terry's interview recorded in November with Aaron Paul. He plays  Jesse Pinkman in the AMC series ""Breaking Bad."" The show begins its fifth and final season this Sunday. Jesse was a smalltime meth dealer until he hooked up with his former chemistry teacher Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston. Walt's chemistry background helped him cook some powerful crystal meth.__EOS__ Your co-star, the star of the series ""Breaking Bad"" is Bryan Cranston. Did you know him from ""Malcolm in the Middle,"" I mean from watching him on ""Malcolm in the Middle,"" in which he played the father?__EOS__ Oh yeah, I love him. I loved that show. I thought he was great. And...",3
50014," The Chieftains led the revival of traditional Irish music, and the band is celebrating a five-decade run that's produced more than 50 albums, six Grammys and an Oscar. Paddy Maloney founded The Chieftains. He told us he lost his heart to Irish music back in the 1940s, when his mother gave him a small gift.__EOS__ I was six years of age. My mother bought me what you call a penny whistle, a tin whistle, for one shilling and nine pence.__EOS__ The Chieftains were and are consummate musicians. And their roots music quickly caught the attention of the rock stars of the day. Of course, Paddy Maloney's goal was not only to bring back traditional Irish music, but to breathe new life into it as well.__EOS__ So I adapted my own style of, you know, arrangements and little compositions and riffs here and there, and harmonies. And it got to be heard everywhere. The likes of John Peel, who was the great disc jockey of that era, in the '60s and '70s and '80s, and John was playing our tape in amongst the Beatles and Rolling Stones.",2
50015," Yes. No question? __EOS__ Yeah, no question. Im very old school with this. I mean, the larger here is respect. So if you go around the bases and your flaps are down or you're pumping your fist, you're showing disrespect for the pitcher. It's like running up the game, you know, you've got a no-hitter going, and you break up the no-hitter with a bunt, or you do something like that, where you're actually showing some disrespect. __EOS__ On their turf. __EOS__ And running across the mound is about  I mean, I didn't even put it in the book because it was such an obvious violation. ",3
50016," Now, this is just one example of one the groups that you work with as a hostage negotiator, one of the groups that saw themselves as outside of government control, of not having to follow the law, of being able to arm themselves, hating the government - all aspects of government. And I'm wondering if you think that some of that thinking has entered a little bit more into the mainstream - or at least into the fringes of politics? __EOS__ On a personal level, I think it has, to some extent. I think we are living in a time now, it seems to me, that our political discourse has become pretty acrimonious. And I think folks that hold very opposing views are finding it increasingly challenging to find some common ground, and to engage in discussions in a civilized way. And I think that does not speak well for our country. __EOS__ Are you seeing anything that you're finding very alarming right now? __EOS__ Well, I know after the Oklahoma City bombing, the militia movement in the country seemed to be set back a bit. I think people who view themselves as patriots and with anti-government sentiments, when they saw, for example, all the children that were killed in the day-care center, I think a lot of them said, I didn't buy into this - you know -this isn't being an American; this is not what I want to do. And I think a lot of people turned away from those movements. ",0
50017," And that's Cecil Suwal, who ran the escort service that Eliot Spitzer used in the documentary by our guest, Alex Gibney. Was it hard to get her to talk about this? __EOS__ It was hard. And we just managed to get her just before she went into the federal penitentiary in Danbury. And I think, you know, she had been trying to peddle her book, and I think finally she decided she wasn't having much luck with that. She wanted to have her say before she went to prison. __EOS__ So she explained that, you know, what they did was, you know, it was a very high-priced escort service. And when the scandal broke, everybody knew about Ashley Dupre, who was the woman who I guess the FBI had actually really focused on the particular liaison, in which they caught Spitzer. But you learned that she actually was not the woman in the service who he dealt with most frequently, right? __EOS__ That's correct. I mean, and it's really astounding to think of it because we all thought of Ashley Dupre that way. I mean, we figured she was the gal. In fact, in many cases, she's referred to by mainstream media outlets as the love gov's gal or Spitzer's gal, as if somehow she was a kind of regular person for Eliot Spitzer. ",1
50018," And how are you recommending that we do that? For instance, you're recommending that the United States create a new position, a distinguished American-Muslim ambassador... __EOS__ Well, there is one... __EOS__ ...for special... __EOS__ ...already appointed. And so, that was begun actually, under President Bush and a new appointee under this president. And so, there are these strategic challenges that require us to engage with religious communities abroad on the basis that secularism is the worst approach. In other words, the old idea that we've had in certain circles that as societies evolve and become more modern, they would become more secular is frankly the opposite of what's happened. ",3
50019," Mm-hmm. So the experience of your parents - or parents that you knew -with divorce so soured your views of long-term relationships? __EOS__ Yes, and I think the idea of commitment and trust has really shifted. And being a modern woman who has a career and pursues her own interests, it's very difficult to find some sort of balance in what a new relationship is. And I think that's definitely going in flux right now and will be defined in the next few years. But I was also curious about what you thought this new direction would be if it - we're going to just come up with a whole new model… __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ …if that's possible. ",0
50020," Is it key for boys to have consistent authority figures, also guides in their life? I guess that's what I was thinking about because your father died when you were very young, but he was there in the very early years, not so for Wes, the other Wes. __EOS__ Absolutely, yeah. And, you know, there's actually a part in the book where Wes and I are talking about our fathers, and he said something that I think is very true when he said, you know, your father isn't here because he couldn't be. My father wasn't there because he chose not to be. And therefore, we're going to mourn their absences differently. __EOS__ What does the other Wes Moore want from this book? __EOS__ You know, whats amazing, Wes has had the chance to read the whole book, and he's had two reactions to it. The first reaction was, he's like, it's amazing that you got all the facts right because, he said, it's obvious you've done a lot of homework and a lot of research and talked to a lot of people. ",0
50021," Thank you very much. __EOS__ Secretary Burns, the Serbian government sponsored a huge rally on Thursday to protest Kosovo's independence. Now, the vast majority of the demonstrators were peaceful, as we've heard, but does the U.S. believe the Serbian government somehow incited or fomented the rioting and attack on the U.S. embassy and the other embassies? __EOS__ Well, put it this way. The Serb government did fail to protect our embassy. There were police around the embassy. They disappeared and melted into the crowd as the mob attacked our embassy. We had 14 people inside. The mob set fire to the ground floor of the embassy. They tried to break further into the embassy. It was a very dangerous situation. And I called the prime minister of Serbia, Prime Minister Kostunica, and I said we hold him and his government to be personally responsible for what happened. __EOS__ What sort of rhetorical suasion do you think you have with the Serb government? Have they given you any assurances that this won't happen again? ",3
50022," I suspect that that was the case. How was the catering?__EOS__ If you like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, then you're in the right spot.__EOS__ We always joke that we might - we're probably the only nominees who, in moving out of their apartment, had to get down on their hands and, you know, scrub the floor, you know, to get our deposit back.__EOS__ There are - you're following a football team through a season, and it's a remarkable team and a remarkable season. And you have some very charismatic people among them. This is Coach Courtney, who's, I think, gave you an idea at the beginning or your process that you were on to something. But there's a moment in the film where he's talking with one of this players Montrail - known as Money - Brown, a right tackle who lived by himself, was injured, didn't want to go to school, but finally was convinced, partly by himself, but partly by the coach to go through rehab to make it possible to maybe get back to play the last game of the season. And the doctor tells him he can't play in that last game.",1
50023," …as I remember. It was a very scary scene because it was wet. I had no idea that truck was going to be as close as it was in the scene. There was a place where we had to get out of the way and Marlon was supposed to open the door. The door wouldn't open. He actually broke that glass and he actually cut his hand a little bit. The designated door was not unlocked or was jammed or something. So Marlon Brando is that kind of actor, he just - he broke the glass and we got inside, just in time. __EOS__ I guess you didn't have to do that scene again? __EOS__ No. __EOS__ No. ",1
50024,"  I don't know, maybe home.__EOS__  Are you lying?__EOS__  No.__EOS__  Are you a liar?",1
50025," This is an important charge against Sanger and against birth control, and later, population control overall, and it's one to be taken very, very seriously. 1916 happens to be also the year that Madison Grant published ""The Passing of the Great Race,"" which is this sort of racial history of America.__EOS__ Outlawing it? Outlawing forced sterilization?__EOS__ No, making provisions for forced sterilization.__EOS__ Oh.",3
50026," Why did you want to write from the point of view of a chaplain in Iraq?__EOS__ Well, I mean, in one level it just - it was fascinating to me, right? It was a way in to look at all these moral and spiritual issues that war raises. And so a chaplain seemed to be the perfect entry point for talking about the kind of impossible situation these Marines are in. He's at a staff level, so it allowed me to look a little bit at the structure of the command and how in a bad command - how that filters down to the lowest level and the things that happen at the lowest level. And also I've - you know, I've always been a fan of a lot of, you know, the great Catholic literature - Flannery O'Connor, Francois Mauriac, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh. And, you know - you know, I was educated by Jesuits, so that probably has something to do with it.__EOS__ You know, when - in the reading that you did in the story about the chaplain, he starts praying in his own words and then he says, I asked God to protect the battalion from further harm. I knew he would not. In another one of your stories, a soldier asked a chaplain, why should I pray? It won't protect me. And the chaplain said, that's not what prayer is for. It will not protect you. It's for your soul.__EOS__ Right.",0
50027,"  I captured the light in your eyes.__EOS__  I'd send you a love letter, though you may never read it - that it goes out from my heart.__EOS__  I'd send you a love letter. I'd send you a love letter. I'd send you a love letter.__EOS__ That's Ian McLagan sharing the story behind the song ""Love Letter."" It's from his new album called ""United States.""",2
50028," Well, it wasn't that - that was part of the downside, which when I was coming down, it was like oh, this is kind of fun, you know, but not really something I ever did with Green Day. __EOS__ So the guy who used to take off his clothes while he was performing, could you ever imagine yourself doing that? __EOS__ Yeah, I did. __EOS__ You did? ",2
50029,"  Where are you from? __EOS__  Jackson, Mississippi. __EOS__  This isn't Jackson. You can respond to just every strange man that picks you up on a subway platform, too dangerous. __EOS__  Now you tell me. ",3
50030," Hmm. __EOS__ …which actually it will be eventually a form of anesthetic. __EOS__ Richard Holmes, you write about how Coleridge and many other Romantic Age poets in Britain sort of saw an affinity between poetry and science. __EOS__ That's right. I mean, it's very, very striking. We started off with Coleridge and his great friendship with Humphry Davy, but also people like Shelley, for example, followed Herschel's astronomy very, very closely. And in his poems, he often added notes, which referred to Herschel's discoveries. ",0
50031,"  We lost Doug.__EOS__  What?__EOS__ We can't find Doug.__EOS__ What are you saying, Phil? We're getting married in five hours.",1
50032,"  If I didn't care... __EOS__ Fleming himself was born into privilege. Just before World War II, he joined British Naval Intelligence, and his experiences there - plus his own flamboyant lifestyle - gave him the perfect basis for Bond, who injected an unthinkable glamour into the austerity years of post-war Britain. Fleming denied that there was much of himself in James Bond. __EOS__ I hope not. People do connect me with James Bond simply because I happen to like scrambled eggs and short-sleeved shirts and some of the things that James Bond does, but I certainly haven't got his guts nor his very lively appetites. __EOS__ In fact, James Bond and Ian Fleming seem wholly intertwined. And the exhibit displayed love letters and details of Fleming's affairs, and a whole array of articles and letters from Fleming's life, as well as a rouge's gallery of Bond villains and pictures of all the Bond girls. There have been other ghost authors writing as Ian Fleming before, but still, the idea of Sebastian Faulks taking on the mantle in the new Bond novel ""Devil May Care"" doesn't sit well with museum visitor Benedict Flurta. ",0
50033," Right. Right. Care to do a little scatting for us right now, just in case you have nothing better to do? __EOS__ You are such a generous singer. You know, and you really rose to the occasion, may I say? __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ In addition to this upbeat stuff we've been with listening to, you do some very pretty tunes on the album, as well. ",2
50034," Yes, hi, great show. I started studying guitar when I was 12, and I learned to read music and play classical guitar and was into all the rock, you know, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, Allan Holdsworth, Eddie Van Halen. But at the age of 38, I was offered to join a very famous punk band from Milwaukee known as the Violent Femmes.__EOS__ Wow.__EOS__ And I learned to play the song I had to play with them that night onstage while the bass player...__EOS__ What do I have to do?",0
50035," They're perfectly clear to me. __EOS__ Where do they come from? I mean, what are they about? __EOS__ That was actually kind of literal, actually. I did dream that my perspective was on a dial. I could change the colors in my dream and I could change the mood by the changing the colors - for me, it's every day life. It's just the way that I see things. In the same way where when you're dreaming, you know, it seems like a bizarre landscape if you were to try to explain it to somebody else, but you understand it completely. __EOS__  The cold and strange could set its hue to the setting sun, to subdue the most immersive blue. ",2
50036," I wonder, at the - after it's all over, inevitably, the process of making a movie, you have to make decisions and compromises and go with this instead of that. Are you happy with it? __EOS__ With ""Pollock""? __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ Yeah, very much so. I think it's stood up over the 10 years since it was made, and I've - people seem to appreciate it. Yeah, I feel very good about ""Pollock."" I'm very proud of it. ",1
50037," So I know what you're saying. But I guess I find this – you know what? This is about freedom from slavery. This is about being redeemed. This is about getting your homeland that was, you know, promised to you. This is about return. It's actually – it is a deeply sincere text. I think it is truly thanking God for the food that we are eating, for the freedom that we have, for the, you know, for the family around us.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is writer Nathan Englander. He has a new collection of short stories called ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank"" and he's also translated a new version of the Haggadah which is the prayer book that's used on Passover during the Seder.__EOS__ Which is awesome.__EOS__ Do you like that movie?",0
50038,"  It's better than, you know, Jefferson Airplane.  But I think      it's just about as--I mean, there is a certain--I think Exene and I have      taught each other how to sing in a certain way that we understand, and we      can apply that to a number of different songs.  And it does have a sort      of plaintive Midwestern sound.  I don't know why; just because. __EOS__  So why was ""Born To Be Wild"" something you wanted to put on      this album? __EOS__  Because it sounds good.  That's the first--that's our--you      know, quality is job number one here at theknitters.com.  Seriously... __EOS__  It seems like I read a review somebody didn't like it.  I can't      remember who it was. ",2
50039," Yeah. At some point in history I'm sure that a lot of women who didn't want to have children became nuns because that was a really good way out of it.__EOS__ So we were talking about how you never really wanted to have children, but you always wanted a dog and you did have a dog who you really loved - a little white dog named Rose. And Rose used to sit with you while you wrote, so you had a very close relationship. But you have a later essay about her death. She was 16. By the time she died she was blind. She was deaf. She couldn't walk for the last year of her life. You had to give her medicines, administer fluids. I know some people who have had pets who've died after long illness that were both upsetting and time-consuming as well as expensive, that, you know, I know people who have said I can't have another pet for a while and it's in part because I love my pet so much, you know, I'm still in mourning, but it's also like I can't make that kind of commitment again.__EOS__ I don't understand that.__EOS__ And I was wondering if you got another dog.",0
50040,"  Yeah, we produced the songs. __EOS__  And Leon, have you been playing on this? __EOS__  Yes. __EOS__  It's you at the piano? ",2
50041,"  You're not going to die on the planet, Guy.__EOS__  I'm not? Then what's my last name?__EOS__  It's - I don't know.__EOS__  Nobody knows. You know why? Because my character isn't important enough for a last name because I'm going to die five minutes in.",0
50042," Can you tell us about Kurt Bardella? Not a name most people would recognize.__EOS__ Right, I mean, Kurt Bardella is the press secretary - the former press secretary to Congressman Darrell Issa. He was someone who watched ""West Wing"" as a kid and became enthralled with the idea of Washington as this thrilling screen game. And he said, look, I'm not so much as a D or an R, I'm an O, I'm an opportunist. And essentially, he wanted a ticket to Washington because this game was so thrilling to him. And Kurt was very good at his job. He got Darrell Issa a great deal of press and I started following him around. And he was rather blunt about his own ambitions. He really flouted the ethic in Washington that you're supposed to cloak your own ambitions in nonchalance.__EOS__ But you're even smiling now. There's something about that that to you find endearing.__EOS__ Absolutely, I mean, look. I have a bias towards transparency. I mean, Washington is a city of poses and posturing and very few people are willing to talk about how ambitious they are, to show their demons as nakedly as Kurt did. I mean, I think some of the characters that come off best - according to some readers - people like Harry Reid and Tom Colburn, who were two Senators from completely different sides of the spectrum and who can't stand each other, but there is a transparency about them and there was a transparency about Kurt that I was very, very enamored of because it's just much more out-front.",0
50043," I was going to start describing it, but I figured how much of the movie should I be giving away.__EOS__ We're very insecure.__EOS__ No, I love the part where Mark Wahlberg is kind of - he seems to be on some kind of, like, roller cart or something because he's kind of shooting and rolling backwards at the same time.__EOS__ That's all we needed.",1
50044," This note says congratulations. I'm proud of you, Walt. You've earned the real thing. Love, Dad. __EOS__ It was a hard thing to speak at that time. Even now, years later. I would move from school to school, and in those moves I kind of lost the notes. I was upset about that. You know, you pack things up and you move to another school. A few years ago in unpacking my supplies at another school that I was at, I came across the notes. And as I took them out to look at them, I noticed something strange. Their handwriting was different on the two notes. When I got out of that was the fact that Mom was aware of the promise. The second note Mom wrote. __EOS__ I think the fact that Mom had the wherewithal to sit down and write this, you know, as she was grieving for her husband with her children. That was remarkable. __EOS__ That was kind of a powerful one for me. The power of a promise kept. ",3
50045," Well, I will hopefully see you - look you up when I'm back in L.A. next time.__EOS__ You better do that now. Thank you, Guy.__EOS__ Thanks, Walter.__EOS__ Take care.",3
50046," ...it's not perfect. __EOS__ Are you saying it's sloppy? __EOS__ No. __EOS__ Let's just cut to the chase, you know. ",2
50047," Because I don't think there is any apology for the war in this sense, how do you apologize for the death of 58,000 Americans and two to three million Vietnamese? I think he's done something far more interesting. He has gone back over the history of the war. Don't forget, this is the man who ordered the Pentagon Papers to be created. If you like, it's that same instinct to go back over the past, to look at it, to try to understand it. For the totally unsympathetic, the people who will hate McNamara no matter what, they will look at this attempt to go back over the past as excuse-making, oh yeah, sure, he's going back over the past. But he's going over the past just to provide a gloss on the past, to make himself look better. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. Your interview with McNamara as it is in the movie ""The Fog of War,"" starts with him having to pick up where he left off. I guess because, like, the tape or the film had run out and he has to like pick up in the middle of a sentence. In fact, let me just play this little exert. __EOS__ Now I remembered exactly the sentence I left off on. I remember how it started and I was cut off in the middle, but you can fix it up someway. I don't want to go back - introduce the sentence because I know exactly what I wanted to say. __EOS__ Go ahead. ",1
50048," Well, it's as male as Oprah's audience is female. __EOS__ Interesting. __EOS__ It is at least as well-educated as any mainstream publication or show, and older, conservative, Republican people, mostly in the heartland -although Limbaugh is the most popular show in most of the coastal cities, including New York. __EOS__ You know, it's not a secret. I think a lot of people would be surprised about one thing that you tell us in the book, and that's, you know, here we have one of the most heard voices in America, but Rush Limbaugh is actually almost deaf.

50049," My name is Dustin Lance Black, and I'm a screenwriter-director. And the film that I've seen a million times is ""When Harry Met Sally"" with Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, and directed by Rob Reiner. I probably saw ""When Harry Met Sally"" for the first time in college. So I was aligned right with the first scene of the movie.__EOS__  Oh, hi, Sally. Sally, this is Harry Burns. Harry, this is Sally Albright.__EOS__  Nice to meet you.__EOS__ You meet these two characters. They're wrapping up their college years and going to move to New York.",1
50050,"  Yes.  __EOS__ So she could report from there.  And she witnessed a Hamas gunman shooting an alleged Israeli sympathizer in the head.   __EOS__  Uh huh. __EOS__  And the gunman told her, don't tell anybody about this.  What did she do? ",3
50051," I think what goes on is that people interpret these things and make sense of them in their own culture context so that the work has different meanings in different places. I would like a world in which there was more exchange because I think some of the most vital cultural moments, human cultural moments, come when that exchange happens. __EOS__ The philosopher joins us to discuss the benefits of cultural contamination and his new book. Plus a candidate reflects on politics in Canada, and a rock entered the annals of espionage. It's the TALK OF THE NATION after the news. __EOS__ Ethics in a World of Strangers. Good to have you back on TALK OF THE NATION. __EOS__ It's very nice to be with you. ",0
50052," Well, the first time I thought that was when Gerry and I were having problems when we still lived in New Jersey, and the lyrics were abysmal. I hated what I was writing and I was like, don't even bother. The second time was when I was in California, and under James's influence and out on the road with him in these college gigs, and I found myself missing Charlie. By then Charlie and I were married, and I wrote ""So Far Away"" with Charlie in mind, personally, and James in mind, musically. And I thought, you know, I think this is going to work. I'm going to keep writing - and inspired by James, truly inspired by James. That was the beginning of my career as a solo writer.__EOS__ So why don't we hear ""So Far Away."" And this is from Carole King's ""Tapestry"" album.__EOS__  So far away. Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore? It would be so fine to see your face at my door. Doesn't help to know you're just time away. Long ago I reached for you and there you stood. Holding you again could only do me good. How I wish I could. But you're so far away. One more song about moving along the highway. Can't say much of anything that's new. If I could only work this life out my way. I'd rather spend it being close to you. But you're so far away. Doesn't anybody stay in...__EOS__ So that's Carole King ""So Far Away"" from her album ""Tapestry.""",0
50053," And tell us what this recording is and why you chose it.__EOS__ This is a recording - this is a demo that Elvis Costello did in a hotel room. It wasn't released on an album originally. I think it was - I've loved this song for about 20 years. It was released as an album extra off of ""My Aim Is True,"" a reissue in the early '90s. And it's called ""Jump Up.""__EOS__ You know, that's a completely surreal message to get on your cell phone to a kid who was rocking out to, you know, ""Armed Forces."" But I love the song because it's sort of a satirical song. It's got a parodic nature to it, or not a parodic nature, but it's really, it's got sort of a political, satirical song.__EOS__ But I've always thought of it as a - it's sort of like a - it's a person who is talking about insignificance in the name of power or of something that they want, and also talking about the hypocrisy of politicians. The second verse goes ",2
50054," All the bands that we deal with are all Japanese bands. Some of them have ties with anime, because they do the anime opening songs. Others are just popular music that the kids like. __EOS__ The Slants' songs about Asian-American alienation don't seem to have hurt their appeal to white teenagers. If anything, they resonate with kids whose geeky adoration for anime makes them outsiders in their own way. Just one convention gig was enough to fund the band's first CD. Simon Young and A-Ron say they'll never forget the screaming kids at that show. __EOS__ Dressed up like Sailor Moon, and kids dressed up like DragonBall Z, and it's amazing. It's like a big party. It's like Halloween. But it's great. The kids are so genuinely enthused and excited about that. __EOS__ Yeah. It was definitely one of my favorite shows I've ever played in my life. ",2
50055," Well, I mean, I love a challenge. There's, like, nothing that gets my heart going than the sense that I will fail. And this was kind of one of the last ones left. And just such an obvious one, like, you've written short stories. You've made movies. Can you write a novel? And to be honest, I think this novel right after - actually writing it right after I finished ""The Future,"" my last movie. And it took a little adjusting to get back into, like, this is just a book. Like, it will never be acted out. And I remember having, like, ruminations like could Scarlett Johansson play Clee? Is she too old? And then I'd be, like, no, there will be no Scarlett Johansson, Miranda. There will just be you writing blonde hair, large breasts. Like, you know, that's what you get. And eventually I calmed down and, like, glued myself to my chair.__EOS__ Do you think it'll become a film at some point?__EOS__ I mean, I loved that idea while I was writing it. And I felt, like, God, this is the most, like, dramatic thing I've ever made. It's like a better movie than my movies are. Although now that it's done, I'm like, oh, it's done. Like, it doesn't need, you know, another step to it.__EOS__ Miranda July's new novel is called ""The First Bad Man."" Miranda July, thank you.",0
50056," But yeah, no, I mean, there was a variety. These guys were not all of a kind. And so it's hard to generalize about them. So yes, certainly there were some old-school chauvinists among them.__EOS__ But did you find that your preparation for manhood wasn't necessarily the kind of manhood that was going to be a positive thing for the women who were your peers once you got to college?__EOS__ Oh yeah, it - I mean, it was unorthodox, my childhood, my training. And it wasn't just the women at Yale. It was the young - it was my - you know, it was the young men among my classmates who noticed that I had come from a kind of a different world.__EOS__ So in talking about the bar where you grew up, in part, you write that there was lots of sex at the bar, that sex was one of the foundational premises of the bar, so it made a kind of sense that people had sex all over the premises  in the parking lot, in the bathrooms, in the basement. Did you end up running into some of these examples before you actually understood the facts of life?",0
50057," And then I just, you know, realized the endless possibilities of a sampler, you know. __EOS__ You started playing drums when you were in high school, yes? __EOS__ No, actually I started when I was two. __EOS__ Oh, okay. ",2
50058," So are the villagers in Dir succeeding in driving out the Taliban? __EOS__ Well, it's been four or five days. It's really not known. I mean, they have certainly killed a number of Taliban. A lot of villagers have also been killed. The problem in all this area is that the military has banned any kind of independent assessment by journalists or aid workers or human-rights workers. There's nobody up there to tell us what is really going on. __EOS__ You're not allowed in? __EOS__ No, nobody is allowed in. I mean, we don't have any independent assessment for the last month as to what's been happening, for example in the Swat Valley or in Dir, and all phone - mobile-phone connections and land lines have been cut off by the army. So you can't even phone anyone there to find out what's going on on the ground. ",0
50059," So you have to know a lot of languages but mostly Italian, right.__EOS__ You have to know enough to know - I sing in Italian, Czech, Russian, French, German, English.__EOS__ Wow. OK, so back to - I'm not going to say the title again.__EOS__ So in this, like you're a fortune teller, and introduce the aria we're about to hear.",2
50060," Last year, you tweeted a cartoon. And it wasn't your cartoon, but the cartoon depicts Jesus and Muhammad, and Jesus is saying, hey, and Muhammad is saying, how are you doing? And you wrote in your tweet,  this is not offensive, and I'm sure God is greater than to feel threatened by it.__EOS__ Yes, it's very odd - everything that's happening now because I went through all of this last year and, as you mentioned, I received some very serious threats coming - originating in some cases from Pakistan from organized terrorist groups there. And, you know, my family was targeted as well and their addresses were published online, and it got very nasty. The reason I did this - and I want any Muslim listening to understand this especially. I did it in defense of Muslims. And when you understand the context, you'll understand how this came about.__EOS__ Right, and it didn't say the Prophet Muhammad. It just said Mo.__EOS__ It didn't. It just said Mo. So, therefore, there was no excuse of racism, of any form of negative commentary on Muslims at all because even the stick figure called Mo was simply saying, how are you doing? There was no commentary beyond that. And so that particular cartoon really teased out the issue - the real issue at hand here that this incident in France, the Charlie Hebdo massacre, was about blasphemy. We can sidestep it all we like. We can, you know, scapegoat all we like. We can blame the 12 dead cartoonists for being racist which is a very, you know, dishonorable thing to do. The real issue at hand here is about blasphemy. It is about the fact that the vast, you know, overwhelming majority of young Sunni Muslims are unfortunately intolerant of any non-Muslim depicting the Prophet Muhammad in any way whatsoever.",3
50061," Well, he believes that when he puts material out, it should be put out to some degree in context and that he should be able  or he should, in putting that material out, prove that it is  A, authentic; and B, of significance. He believes that a lot of, you know, there's  he has a very difficult relationship with most mainstream news organizations because he believes they do not do that, they do not prove the truth of what they are offering up to their readers or viewers. __EOS__ Now, and I guess the other interesting question is if people are going to be providing confidential information over the Internet, they have to be careful. They have to be confident that it is secure. Give us a little bit of a sense of the technical structure that supports Wikileaks. __EOS__ Well, Wikileaks, part of Assange's goal here is to make sure that no government, no institution can shut down Wikileaks. So it exists on a large number of computer servers all around the world. It has hundreds of domain names. So you could attack one Wikileaks website but not shut them all down. __EOS__ And just to complete the picture here, is Wikileaks based at an office that people can find? Is Assange someone who, you know, is at a location where you can find him? ",3
50062," So how does that compare to the bill that finally passed?__EOS__ The bill that finally passed had virtually all those elements, and virtually all of them, in one way or another, were strengthened. Particularly in the end there was an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with greater teeth, and in the end the compromise involved letting disputes be heard in federal courts so that both sides could have their say, but there were more teeth in the measure than in the initial one.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Todd Purdum. We're talking about his new book about the passage of the Civil Rights Act 50 years ago. The book is called ""An Idea Whose Time Has Come."" Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Todd Purdum, and we're talking about his new book, which is called ""An Idea Whose Time Has Come  Two Presidents, Two Parties And The Battle For The Civil Rights Act Of 1964.""",3

50064," No, I raise my voice once in the film, and then it isn't - I don't raise my voice that loudly. It's been described, I suppose, Smiley, or ""Tinker, Tailor"" has been described as the sort of anti-Bond. It is the very opposite of Bond. Here is a man who doesn't wear a tiepin. He doesn't wear cufflinks.__EOS__ When you were doing the part, did you take it with you off the set? I mean, were you more subdued a person when you were playing Smiley?__EOS__ I think so, I think so, yes.__EOS__ Yes, it was very good for my blood pressure, playing Smiley. Well, my family were not with me, and I stayed in a very modest apartment, and the decor was not too dissimilar to the house of Smiley. And I would come home after work and have dinner on my own and sit there, you know, watch the television. So I guess I was somehow leading a quiet life, an anonymous life, if you like, outside of the set.",1
50065,"  Almost 20 years since you saw her? __EOS__  Yeah. __EOS__  Do you remember what life was like when you lived with her?  As I      understand it, the name of your village is Jewel? __EOS__  Yes. ",0
50066," Just one more question. So you spent seven years writing a novel that's a little over 440 pages in an era when people are spending so much time reading tweets and really short - like things are getting shorter and shorter, although people are binge watching for hours and hours. So I guess we're heading in two directions at the same time. But do you feel like a novelist like you is becoming almost out of synch with the world, spending seven years on one book that's, you know, relatively long that would take, you know, would have to be read over a period of days? And so many people don't have that kind of space in their life, feel like they can't create that kind of space in their life.__EOS__ Yeah. I mean it is...__EOS__ That's a real downer. So I'm sorry. Forgive me....__EOS__ No, no. No, please.",0
50067," He was a continuation of what Thelonious Monk had done. Monk was a great iconoclast of modern music and it took years, even decades, for the audience to kind of catch up to Monk. And Andrew Hill was kind of in the same way. He was stylistically very individual. His career path is very much like Thelonious Monk that he was championed by some critics and journalists but it took decades before he found an audience for his particular style. __EOS__ Andrew Hill was born in Chicago and taught himself the accordion. He took up the piano when he was 10. In the mid '50s, Hill toured with Dinah Washington, Johnny Hartman and Dakota Staton. He later settled in New York, where he recorded several albums with Blue Note Records. __EOS__ Andrew Hill struggled to find an audience and he couldn't keep bands together, but he kept composing even while he worked on his doctorate. Hill taught at universities and prisons and led bands on both coasts. He signed twice with Blue Note Records, releasing his final album, ""Time Lines,"" just last year. __EOS__ Hill performed just a few weeks ago in New York. It was his last show. He died April 20th after a long fight with lung cancer. DJ Scott Willis says Hill leaves a legacy of playing different kinds of jazz and sticking with his passion. ",2
50068," Well, I'll be delighted to. I hope I don't stumble over the words. __EOS__ If we could begin here from Book One to Their Words Alone, if that's all right with you. __EOS__ Ah, here we are. Yes. Chapter One, First Verse of the Book of John in the New Testament that says rather cryptically, In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was with God. And the Word was God. __EOS__ Mr. Wolfe, thank you very much. ",0
50069,"  Well, you made a very crucial distinction just now,      which is that it's neither fiction nor non-fiction; it's lying.  Fiction      is not lying. Fiction is telling the truth about an active imagination.      You're saying, `The truth is that I'm making this up in order to get at      some other layer of truth.'  And the test of your interest into this is      going to be whether you find it a sort of a story that corresponds to      human truth or experience or the recognizable world.  This is somebody      who actually lied, and lying is very different from fiction because he is      deceiving you... __EOS__  But I'm wondering... __EOS__  ...and ... you to a shared... __EOS__  Right.

50070," I'm calling because I am a scientist, have been for some time now. I'm currently finishing a Ph.D. program at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, but my previous life, my bachelor's degree was from Emerson College in communications. And we were required there to take speech, speech pathology, public speaking, all these things that I have not seen as any requirements in scientific programs, and yet we ask our scientists to go out and present and speak. And I don't know why we don't require these. __EOS__ Yeah, how about requiring public speaking in science programs, Randy Olson? __EOS__ That's starting to happen, and I think - when I did my Ph.D., we did not have one single course or workshop or anything in speaking or writing or any of these communication skills. But there's a changing of priorities, and as I say, it's the choice between these two basic elements, how much resources you put into the doing of science, how much into the communicating. And when I was a graduate student, the communications stuff was just seen as almost frivolous, something that you just learned by kind of entrainment. __EOS__ Well, also - and you get at this a lot in your book - they often have if not competing agendas, at least tangential agendas, that if the scientific research is all about depth and rigor and testing and accuracy, communication has a different prerogative. You know, it has to be about it being memorable, about it being funny, about it being meaningful. And sometimes that means leaving out some of the details or, you know, making them funny in a way that is not necessarily in line of the priorities of scientific research. ",0
50071,"  So she has written these brilliant, brilliant books... __EOS__  Yes. __EOS__  ...been entertained and entertained some of the leading thinkers      of her day and yet at 34, after moving to France to cover the French      Revolution, sets off in an affair that is absolutely a disaster. __EOS__  Yes.  Gilbert Imlay, the man she meets, an American in      Paris, has been always described as a cad, a scoundrel; you just get that      one word. And I wanted to look more deeply into this elusive character      because if he's simply a cad or a scoundrel, then Mary Wollstonecraft      looks like a sex-starved dupe.  And I think that Imlay was a more complex      and interesting character. He was a man who certainly expressed very      modern, liberal ideals.  He presented himself as a frontiersman of      Kentucky and... ",0

I mean, he thinks he's in a movie. __EOS__ Yes, exactly. And you call it death by suicide, because he says something that's, like, really stupid and he gets shot. But, you know, for somebody who's written those movies… __EOS__ And who knows the difference between life and a movie, I find it really interesting that you've put those kinds of movie words in his mouth. And instead of making him a hero, it makes some dad. ",0

Here's what you do. And so we got on there. And I think the actual act of what happens on the toilet, I think they had cut it down to about 30 seconds, but there were takes that were two, two-and-a-half minutes long of just pure agony of what was going on in that action.__EOS__ GROSS  How much trust do you have to have in the Farrelly brothers to do a scene like that, that could end up being not only humiliating but not funny? I mean, you don't know if it's going to be funny, really, until you see it.__EOS__ Well, and Jim will tell you the same thing. We know where funny is. You know, we didn't get where we got without guessing right a lot or having that instinct of where the laugh is. But it's film. I mean, we're not going to find out if a general audience laughs for a year. So there's that. So you're at the mercy of whoever's cutting it. We have comic timing; we know that.

My yesterday is Judy Blume.__EOS__ Oh, that is so lovely. I'll tell you about the bordello. That was my bathroom when I was growing up in Elizabeth, New Jersey. My mother decided to decorate our bathroom - we only had one - and it had lavender tile, and my mother chose a black and lavender wild, floral wallpaper.

And so - and it was a subject matter that I really wanted to kind of go deep into and really explore it in all its facets. So it felt like it had to be a 400 page book.

In other words, you know, over a long period of years the element of ritual creeps into different parts of your show and, you know, people are applauding for their favorite song or for something, or something they liked 20 years ago, or something they like that's brand new. But to have everything just come straight, fresh out of the box, and every song is a step into some slightly uncharted territory. __EOS__ I want to talk to you some about Pete Seeger. You said that you came to these songs pretty late, over the last 10 years or so. These were not part of your collective growing up? ",2
50082," There's some very interesting arrangements on ""Noir,"" and your friend Oded Lev-Ari - I hope I pronounced his name right. __EOS__ Perfect. Oded Lev-Ari. __EOS__ Yes. He arranged the songs. Were there any surprises for you in his arrangements? __EOS__ Well, only great surprises. I mean, all the sounds that he got to create out of this - a unique orchestration of this big band. It's a modified big band. We went through the big band tradition where both of us actually played together in high school - in a big band. And, you know, we eliminated the piano - we took a guitar. We added some percussion and we added three cellos, which is very unusual. It was all his idea and his creation and the approach that he had that is not pure big band style. It's coming from all his influences, where he's coming from - everything that he studied in his musical path. And I think he managed to bring so many colors that are unusual for a big band record. ",2
50083," Lot of films. First of all, I'm curious. Looking back over the career that you've had over these years, if there was some advice you could give to the Kevin Kline of 1983, when ""The Big Chill"" was made, what would you say? __EOS__ Oh, gee, assuming I've learned something since then. __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ Yes, the wisdom I have accrued over the years. I would've told me to lighten up, have more fun. I was very serious, you know, and I lived, ate, drank, slept acting. And that was before I had a life. ",1
50084, No. I didn't quite finish the 9th grade. I sort of bailed.__EOS__ Because you knew music was what you wanted to do?__EOS__ Yeah. I practiced all the time. I just spent all my hours in the practice room. I spent six or seven or eight hours a day practicing. And I was pretty sure that's what I wanted to do.__EOS__ It worked out.,2
50085," Can I read you a quote __EOS__ Sure. __EOS__ from one of the books? __EOS__ This is from your novel, The Graving Dock. ",0
50086," One member of the Detroit City Council says Detroit needs to do more to promote its legacy. Her name is Martha Reeves. And yes, she is that Martha Reeves. __EOS__  Whenever I'm with him, something inside… __EOS__ That's Reeves singing in 1964. She talked to us in her office at City Hall yesterday. __EOS__ I've gone to other cities and seen statues and plaques depicting the wonderful, great artists that were created and discovered in their different hometowns. And since Motown left Detroit in the '70s, there had been very little memorabilia. ",2
50087," ""Requiem,"" in that opening, which is the most famous part of it, I've always said, is like music of a man staring at his own grave.__EOS__ You also write about Beethoven.__EOS__ You say that he felt death at his shoulder, which means what?__EOS__ I think for years he was very, very ill a great deal of the time, and he had several near bouts with death from illness starting in middle age.",2
50088," In the pop music world of the time, most performers relied on professional songwriters for their hits. And the entire songwriting industry was centered around one square block in New York City. The core of that block was 1619 Broadway, the Brill Building, a 10-story hit factory stuffed with songwriters, producers and music publishers. __EOS__ And I mean, the place was hopping. Writers, they would run over and pitch their songs, just right there on the spot, start singing it. And the verse would be on a napkin, and he'd reach in his pocket, and the bridge could be on a brown piece of paper bag. __EOS__ Rose had teamed up with a songwriting partner, Charlie Singleton, and they set up their office in a booth at Beefsteak Charlie's. __EOS__ We'd meet there every morning, 6 o'clock, and buy a little glass of wine for 30 cents, and we'd sip on that. And we'd write back there. People got to know us so well they used take our telephone calls. ",2
50089," Just a few years after starring in that film at the age of 18, River Phoenix was nominated for an Oscar, for his performance in ""Running on Empty."" Phoenix was a young man with everything ahead of him when he died of a drug overdose. This Halloween marks the 20th anniversary of the night he died outside the LA nightclub The Viper Room. Phoenix was 23 years old.__EOS__ The Children of God was a Christian sex cult. They believed that sex was a sacrament, and that sort of everyone should be engaged in it. And this, you know, extended to sort of partner swapping, and it also extended to encouraging children to, you know, engage with each other. So at an early age, River was busking on street corners, trying to spread the word and proselytize for the cult. But if he didn't bring home enough loose change that day, the family wasn't going to eat. So it was a lot of weight in a lot of different ways, on a very young child.__EOS__ It was through the Children of God that River and his siblings found their way into show business. Can you describe how that happened?__EOS__ River and his sister got used to performing. So when River was still young, the family left the cult. They decided it had gotten too seamy. But the kids had the bug, and River and Rain started entering talent shows. And what really sort of spurred the change from talent shows and music to acting was River's mother had grown up in the Bronx with Penny Marshall, who was then the star of ""Laverne and Shirley""; and sent a letter saying - you know - we have these kids, they're very talented, what do we do? And it got sort of fobbed off to the Paramount casting department, and said, well, if you're ever in town you can come by. And so the family just packed everything up and said, OK. We're driving across the country.",0
50090," And is your chosen stance an obstacle to that or you just haven't found a person? __EOS__ Well, I definitely desire marriage and children one day and I desire, you know, to find that person. I haven't found him yet. So the search still continues but, you know, I would like for him to find me. So I think it will be us finding one another. __EOS__ Is there an obstacle of being celibate, being abstinent? When you put that out there, do people go, oh, I don't think so. __EOS__ No. Not really. I think that - I think it can be surprising but believe it or not, Michel, there are so many people that actually live in this lifestyle that it's actually people are coming out from, like, behind, you know, places where they've been hiding. Like, oh, my god, I didn't know there was like a thousand of you guys that are living sexual peer. So if you go to my Web site,  iamworththewait.com, there's a page of testimonies of people from all over the country, of all different ages that are living in this lifestyle so. ",0
50091," Well, you're absolutely right about that. The French, who once completely eschewed olive oil, unless they were in the deep south of France along the Riviera, if you open the typical French cookbook in the 1980s, you would barely see olive oil mentioned at all. Today, pick up a French cookbook, and I would say that at least 60 to 70 percent of the recipes are using olive oil. __EOS__ And sometimes instead of butter, right? __EOS__ Oh, absolutely. I mean, you speak to a chef like Alain Ducasse, Roger Verge, all of these famous French chefs, and they extol the virtues of olive oil for its taste, not for its health benefits. __EOS__ Now, there's a lot of American chefs who aren't Italian, but who love Italian food, and who either specialize in it or serve it as part of their menu. Do you think Americans who aren't Italian-American have changed Italian food? ",0
50092," Clarke Peters, let's talk about your character, Lambreaux, who returns to New Orleans as soon as he can after Hurricane Katrina. His home is utterly demolished and yet he asked to be dropped off there. He's not going to go back out of the city again. And he's a Mardi Gras Indian who dresses up for parades, quite a character. __EOS__ Yes. To say he just dresses up for parades is really minimizing a tradition that has gone on for hundreds of years. Mardi Gras Indians is probably more important to America and to the African-American community than they know. Because this is a part of New Orleans that isnt ""Girls Gone Wild"" on Bourbon Street, you know. It's a lot deeper than that. __EOS__ David Simon, now why did you include in this cast of characters, John Goodman, as a college professor screaming at outsiders, reporters - including, by the way, one from NPR - who dont, in his view, understand the city at all? __EOS__ He's not a unique voice to New Orleans. I think if you talked to New Orleaneans, they will say - 95 percent of New Orleaneans - will say that the country did not understand the phenomenon of Katrina and its aftermath. ",2
50093," Remind us how and why and how he wound up getting recruited. Because he, I mean he was a thug from an early age. They certainly didn't teach him that. __EOS__ Yeah. the FBI, you know, going back to the mid-1970s, the FBI had a hankering for thugs. It was part of a national effort to recruit underworld figures as what they call top echelon informants to help them in their highest priority - which was fighting organized crime, the LC and the Italian Mafia. And ""Whitey"" Bulger, as a fairly high-ranking thug in the Boston underworld fit that profile nicely. __EOS__ It also, the key pivotal element here, the recruiter was an agent also from South Boston named John Connolly and that's where Whitey ruled. And John Connolly grew up in South Boston. ""Whitey"" Bulger was a few years ahead of him. Connelly was friendly with the Bulger family. Hes often in the past talked about as a young boy meeting ""Whitey"" Bulger and saying that it felt like meeting Ted Williams. And I think that kind of captures the perverse way that Connolly was looking at things. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. Where is John Connolly now? ",0
50094," I like it as a general proposition, but I have to say I'm the enemy of the romantic industrial complex. I don't think I need a red Maserati as a present to show that, you know, you love me or anything super expensive. I would like, you know, a little handwritten note. That would thrill me, but all the big, expensive things that you see showing up in magazines to advertise the holiday, uh-uh.__EOS__ I think we're going to vote you off the girl island. Sorry.__EOS__ Wait till you get to who pays.__EOS__ That's a riot.",3
50095," So I'd like to start with some of the conversations that went on around your dinner tables after the bombing and after it came out that the suspects were two young men who do claim Islam. So Congressman Carson, I have to ask, what were your first thoughts?__EOS__ Well...__EOS__ Was it oh no?__EOS__ Always. You know, it kind of reminds me of what the African-American community has gone through historically, particularly decades ago when a liquor store was robbed or a bank was robbed. You're like praying that the person is not African-American. In this instance, we have a similar kind of anxiety and tension in hoping that the person isn't Muslim. Unfortunately.",3
50096," Yeah. Long before ""Don't Worry, Be Happy,"" he was blowing people's minds with incredible covers of, like, Beatles songs. He did an unbelievable version of ""Blackbird.""__EOS__ Right. Didn't he do, like, percussion by tapping on himself, too?__EOS__ Yes. He would slap on his chest, and that would sound like the drums. But it would also affect his voice.  I'm not going to do it justice so I won't even try now, but there was a time...__EOS__ I can just tell by that, that you - you were - you did him in your room.",1
50097," Sawatsky says the interview lasted less than three minutes because it was short-circuited by Walters, not the mother. __EOS__ Getting her to open up and pour out her heart, any journalism student can do that, following a few good macro principles. And no $7 million a year network, you know, host can do it by violating these principles. __EOS__ Sawatsky says Walters wrongly articulated the mother's emotions for her instead of coaxing them from her. Walters declined NPR's offer to respond, but Larry King did respond. Unlike Sawatsky, King never prepares his questions ahead of time. He says his spontaneous approach really works. __EOS__ I pride myself on not getting one-word answers. That's really rare. So he may have picked out one or two interviews. Now if you get an interview where the subject is really difficult, you're going to find - does he do interviews for a living? ",3
50098," I'm sure they are and you know what? Just put me in your suitcase. We've been talking to My Block series co-creator Ocean Mac Adams, vice president of MTV News; and the series host, Sway Calloway. Thanks so much for joining me. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ The next My Block installment, My Block  Puerto Rico, airs this Sunday on MTV2. You can see clips from previous My Block shows at NPR.org. ",3
50099," What is an American cheese? __EOS__ American cheese is a cow's milk-derived processed cheese. And it can be sort of - by process it goes through a sort of extruded, it's pushed through a tube, if you will, to get that kind of, sort of, slightly sloppy, slippery texture that we all know. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ And more and more - a lot of it has a lot of the additives I was talking about. You know, it's not just milk anymore. ",0
50100," Well, I think that the war, certainly with Tiger Force, initially, was one of reconnaissance. It was about topnotch soldiers being able to go into the terrain, find the enemy, and call in air strikes. It was a very brave unit. __EOS__ And, Mitch Weiss, in another sense, this is the story of an army cop, a warrant officer in the Criminal Investigations Command by the name of Gustav Apsey, a man who showed incredible determination to unravel this story years after it happened. __EOS__ Correct. Gustav, ironically enough, was the son of a Nazi officer, and he basically, I remember, you know, Gustav telling us stories about how he would see his father come home sometimes from interrogating prisoners, and he was caked with blood, and his father was killed by the Yugoslav resistance in 1944. __EOS__ And in another sense, this is a story about a lost campaign in a lost war, about why Tiger Force was sent into Vietnam Central Highlands in the first place, and about why more senior officers did nothing to try to stop them, and, Michael Sallah, this was reported to battalion officers at the time. It went up the chain of command at various points, and everybody seemed to say, look, just don't stir things up. ",0
50101," Who has not come to terms with this new technological advancement. So I'd far - a selfie is fast, you can knock that out pretty quickly. My other pet peeve is when you're - there's a group of people who want a picture, and someone says just one more because - as if they're speaking for the group, because it's probably not the last one.__EOS__ But there were two people at SNL that I always remember at times like that, Derek Jeter being one and Paul McCartney being the other, who more than anyone else, I felt like everybody at SNL, from the crew to the cast to guests of the show, had something they wanted to tell them, like some moment of their career that had so affected this person. And both Derek Jeter and Paul McCartney made so much time for everybody that had wanted it, and I always remember anytime I don't take a picture with someone, I'm saying I'm a bigger deal than Paul McCartney and Derek Jeter. So I try to take them every time.__EOS__ Do you miss ""Saturday Night Live""?__EOS__ I do. I miss it a little bit less every day, which is nice. The thing I was so worried about leaving SNL with just the family and the routine and all the wonderful people that I got to spend so much time with, and obviously as you build your - a new show, like we have, you find that there are other really lovely people that you get to sort of build a new family with. So that's been great.",3
50102," One of Barry Egan's sisters storms into his warehouse, and she's talking a million miles a minute.__EOS__  I can't find that thing in my car. I can't find it, but I can get it and give it to you later.__EOS__ There's this beautiful schizophrenic cacophony of events and dialog happening, but it's not disorienting. It's actually very seductive and engaging. And it's one of my favorite sequences in movies ever.__EOS__  What is this pudding?",1
50103," No, he made it back. He did two tours and came back. And he's home. __EOS__ Let's talk about another one of the songs on your CD ""The Story,"" ""Wasted"" had very interesting lyrics. This is a song - it seems to me about the frustration of watching somebody waste their talent. Want to listen to a little bit of the song? __EOS__ Why not. __EOS__  If you had eyes like golden crowns and diamonds in your fingertips you're wasted. If shining wisdom passed your lips and traveled to the ears of god you're wasted. And so I hate that your overrated most revered and celebrated cause you're wasted. Then again it's good to get a call. Now and then just to say hello. Have I said I hate to see you go. I hate to see you go. ",2
50104, Or a man and his glove. And I say this without exaggeration. It is probably the most intensely felt relationship that I've had in my life. __EOS__ With an inanimate object. __EOS__ With an inanimate object. __EOS__ You actually took it for an expert consult? ,0
50105,"  Well, I would say yes, but to me it's like breathing. I can't take credit for a lot of my music. You know, I've called myself a song-catcher rather than a songwriter because I feel like this is just something that I know how to do, and I feel really blessed that I do it but it's just second nature to me.__EOS__ Let's try and squeeze in another one if we can, OK?__EOS__ Sure.__EOS__ Let's listen to ""Ain't No Man,"" particularly a line I really admire, she's hot as the fire at the end of the cigarette, rich as a church's Wednesday night basket.",2
50106," I love it. Man, that's Lake Bell, Fred Melamed and Ken Marino in a kind of collage of your auditions for this trailer in the new movie ""In A World."" And Lake, did you write that?__EOS__ Yes. Yes.__EOS__ Every line is a perfect cliche.__EOS__ Yes. Thank you. I appreciate that.",1
50107," Hi Farai, how you doing? __EOS__ I'm doing great, so, it's out in the stores today. Give us a scene setter for the emotional action. __EOS__ Well, it's a story like you said in your introduction, it takes place on the college football - on a college football campus. The main character, Brady Bledsoe, you know, is a star in his own right and he's kind of dealing with some issues when he comes to celibacy, a promise he made to his mother, Carmyn. You know, it's a book about a college football, it's a book about mothers and sons, and it's a book about what happens when secrets are kept and when a young lady enters this young man's life. __EOS__ It's a - you know, you've got so many different aspects to it, but you certainly make out the game of football recruiting to be incredibly tough and there's a lot of journalistic documentation of that. But did - how did you get into that world? How did you get a peek into the world of football recruiting in order to learn enough to write this book? ",0
50108," The first dance that I knew about was the one that I played for. At that time, I didn't have radio, electricity or anything in that , nothing.__EOS__ Seen through the peculiar lens of Mississippi law then, Miss Wong's Chinese face was as non-white as a black one. So the Sweethearts evaded the crime of race mixing and the arm of Jim Crow.__EOS__ We got into Baltimore, and I asked Millie Jones, who was part American Indian, part black, if she'd like to go downtown on a bus with me to window shop. And I decided we should have a Coke. And I said, let's go into Woolworth's. And she and I sat down. We just sat there, and I was becoming more and more irritated. So I said to Millie, I'm just going to stop this waitress and find out why she's ignoring us. And Millie got very excited and jumped up and ran up those stairs. And I didn't know what the problem was, but I ran after her. I mean, she was really frightened.__EOS__ Later, the road manager explained the facts of life.",2
50109," allow people from - with their own - and finally, throughout the health care debate, as we have talked with law makers across the political spectrum, we have asked them, what is your bottom line? We asked, for example, House Majority Whip James Clyburn this question at the beginning of the week and he said while he does not like this amendment, that he feels that the overriding goal of extending health care coverage to people who dont presently have it has to be the objective. And he would reluctantly vote for final passage, even if this amendment is included. What about you? __EOS__ Well, I circulated a letter and 41 people have signed it saying, this is too high a price to pay. If by some remote possibility the bill came back with this exact language in it, we would say, take the bill off the table and go work on it. __EOS__ And Congresswomen, finally, if I could just press you one more time on this whole question of the rider. Youre saying that people wont buy these riders if offered. People do buy riders for health care issues all the time. I mean, people now who buy individual policies on the open market can choose or choose not to buy coverage for maternity services, thinking they may or may not get pregnant. So why is this different? __EOS__ Let me try it again. Unlike maternity services, where you think, you know, I really might want to get pregnant and have a baby, people dont plan for an unwanted pregnancy. They dont plan to get pregnant when they didnt want to or to have a planned pregnancy that goes terribly wrong. And so, theyre not going to think I better pay extra money every month in case this unplanned situation happens. And thats the problem with a rider. ",3
50110," Well, that's very true. A lot of it has to do with attitude, just like Leah and the other folks that you were talking about. At least they have a good attitude. But it's true, even within my own family I talk about in the book, too, how I have a guilt complex about being the one that's so successful when so many of them are so much more talented than me. And so many friends that I know in Nashville that have twice the talent that I've had, that I've seen them come and go through the years and never see their dream come true.__EOS__ How do you keep focus in the face of challenges, in the face of time, in the face of what you describe people who are energy vampires?__EOS__ Well, I never wanted to have to work a real job. I never wanted to work that hard. I knew that God gave me a talent, and he gave me the kind of personality that I could use my personality, as well as my talent. And I just felt like if I, kind of, followed direction, I pray and ask for guidance, and I believe what I pray, and I just kind of wait for, you know, answers or at least a kind of feel of how to do it and what not to do and, you know, who to work with, who not to work with.__EOS__ Let's get another caller in.

50111,  Those right there. __EOS__ These? __EOS__  Yep. __EOS__  I'll buy them for you. ,1
50112," It was a fascinating choice. I think he chose Robinson because Robinson was so intelligent and so competitive and so strong. He wanted somebody who would not just integrate the game but somebody who would really push the point, who would make it clear that black players were here to stay and that they were not to be trifled with. __EOS__ So he was someone who could probably stand up to all the media scrutiny? __EOS__ Not just the media scrutiny but the animosity he was going to get from - even from his own team, not to mention from his opponents. There were a lot of people who thought, if we could drive this guy out and do it quickly, we might end this integration experiment before it really takes hold. __EOS__ Was there any evidence of that on the field that day? ",0
50113," From here, we move inland to a giant monument that to motorists passing through its arches must look like an old bridge. It's actually an ancient 90-foot high aqueduct that once brought water to the royal cisterns.__EOS__ When Greeks and Romans started coming and settling in this city, the city had a major problem. The nearest source of water was called Belgrade Forest - 25 kilometers west of city. So they built these huge water bridges called aqueducts. And to me, it has a special meeting. You are coexistent with history.__EOS__ To reach our next destination, we climb steep, winding streets alongside creaking bicycle carts. We're looking for Tekfur Palace, home of Palaeologus, the last Byzantine emperor. It's tucked away amid modest apartment blocks in a working-class neighborhood. Alton says, he can't blame Turks for not recognizing the amazing history all around them because they don't learn to appreciate it in school.__EOS__ Seventy years ago, in the history department of Istanbul University, there was a subdivision of Byzantine history. Today, there is no division or subdivision to study Byzantine history, although Istanbul - old Constantinople - is the center - is the heart of the old Byzantine civilization.",0

50117," Well, those of us who discovered him. For me, he was a beacon in a philosophical sense too because I needed to know that there was someone else out there that didn't want all those trappings too. You know, when I was growing up in the rock 'n roll school in England in the '60s, it just seemed to be a given that everyone was going to end up on TV and the ambition was to have a top 10 single. And I felt really alone in the fact that I didn't want anything. I just wanted to become  reasonably good at what I was doing.__EOS__ And you wrote in your autobiography, you know, you were a bit tired of the guitar hero thing and the gymnastic guitar playing. So it sounds like J.J. Cale helped to start to dial you back to be a little more restrained perhaps in the soloing. Is that accurate?__EOS__ Yeah, I think it was getting out of control. You know, heavy metal came out of all that stuff too. It was like volume and proficiency and virtuosity. There didn't seem to be any reasonable limit to that. It was just crazy. And so I wanted to go in the other direction and try to find a way to make it minimal, but you still have a great deal of substance. I mean, that was the essence of J.J.'s music.__EOS__ We're speaking with Eric Clapton of his new album ""The Breeze  An Appreciation Of J.J. Cale.""

We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.__EOS__ August 28, 1963 was a beautiful, hot summer day in Washington. When I got up to speak, I saw a sea of humanity. You saw many young people getting up in the trees so they could get a better view. You saw people with their feet in the water, trying to keep cool.__EOS__ John Lewis was the youngest person to speak that day, 23 years old. His was the sixth speech; Dr. King was number 10. Lewis is now a congressman from Georgia, 68 years old. That's old enough to have witnessed an incredible arc of history - from his days as a civil rights worker, beaten bloody by police, to tonight, when he will recount his story at Invesco Field.__EOS__ August, 1963, we live in a different America. In the heart of the American South, hundreds and thousands of people have been arrested, jailed.

And of course we were shooting a movie in New York in black and white, and you know, I was thinking about ""Manhattan"" and ""Broadway Danny Rose"" and ""Stardust Memories,"" the ones he did that Gordon Willis photographed, and there's such majesty in the photography. And those movies are sort of, you know, they're intimate stories, they're people sort of working out their own stuff, and - but the photography and often the music in those movies treats it like a grand cinematic experience. And I think, you know, that's how I, you know, ultimately feel about those little things and, you know, about intimate stories. I think they are cinematic and grand, and that's how ""Frances"" felt to me. That, you know, this, you know, watching this woman decide whether or not to pay a surcharge at an ATM machine when she's in a rush and broke, to me felt like it could be big cinema.

I've taken it off for - I've taken it out here and there. And I'm not necessarily judging. I'm just saying sometimes it's nice to play that card but also it's nice to play other cards. And I know I have that sexy card in my deck but I don't always have to use that card. And especially like with this new song called ""Unconditionally"" that's on the record.__EOS__  Oh no, did I get you close, oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?__EOS__  Unconditionally, I will love you unconditionally. There ain't no fear now. Let's go and just be free. I will love you unconditionally.__EOS__ Can I give you some questions from some of your young admirers?",2

50124," Whether it's a weave, braids, twists or locks, hair is big business in African-American communities, but the recession is leaving some beauty salons with empty chairs. We'll talk about it in a special Beauty Shop that's coming up. But first, our regular Faith Matters conversation. That's where we talk about matters of faith and spirituality.

50127," First, let's try and differentiate fact from fiction. These essays aren't meant to be a literal memoir, are they?__EOS__ No. in fact, whenever Jean Shepherd told stories, whether they were kid stories or Army stories, I believe they were just about totally fiction. What is true, I believe, is that he was so sensitive to his surroundings and to what was going on and what life was like, that he knew what it was like to be a kid. He knew what it was like to be in the Army. And from knowing what it was like, he then created his fictional stories out of that.__EOS__ Taking him at his word for just a moment, was he the only Druid in the U.S. Army?__EOS__ So he claimed. And he got the little D on his dog tag for Druid.",0
50128," This is a story based on an experience that I think a lot of young men have had and young women, where you're in what you think is a very good, fun, stable, platonic friendship and then ultimately it turns out that one of the people in that friendship have ulterior motives.__EOS__ You were one of the youngest writers to ever write for ""Saturday Night Live,"" which is a really big deal. What was that like? I mean, just walking around the halls and, like, you're collaborating with Bill Hader and Andy Samberg and all these amazing people. That had to have been a complete trip.__EOS__ It was really fun. I, you know, I grew up watching ""Saturday Night Live"" and it was really surreal to actually physically be there. It did feel on some nights like you'd walked into a TV screen, you know, like you were living in this alternate reality. And it was really high-pressure. But I like the rhythm of it, throwing out 50, 100 sketches a year and seeing what'll stick. That's how I write books too. You know, for ""The Last Girlfriend on Earth,"" there's 30 pieces in the book. I can't even imagine how many I must have written that didn't make the cut - at least 100 beyond that.__EOS__ Would you mind reading us out on page 178?",0
50129," And what was his film rated? It sounds pretty violent. __EOS__ Yeah, it was. They actually had, they actually showed an eye operation, pulling the shards of this grinding wheel out of his eyes and it was - this was a different one, I don't remember what the name of this one was, but that was another that really stayed with me that whenever you're in any type of machine shop or woodworking place, you should always wear your safety glass. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ Maybe Quentin Tarantino directed that one.

Times and Salon. Miller also wrote a book about private military contractors called ""Blood Money  Wasted Billions, Lost Lives and Corporate Greed in Iraq."" __EOS__ Yes, I think you're absolutely right. I think a lot of people - to the degree they think about contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan at all - I think the first images, the first ideas that come to mind, are the Blackwater incidents, the violence, some of the waste and fraud and abuse. __EOS__ Has writing this series given you any insights to why Americans become civilian contractors and risk their lives for a salary, to work in Iraq or Afghanistan? Like, who does that and why? ",0

50132," This album, I mean, it clearly has a lot of range. There's a lounge song, ""Be My Man,"" that made me think of a Woody Allen film.__EOS__ Honestly, I sit down when I begin to make records and I say I want this record to sound like a Woody Allen film. And...__EOS__ Is that true or are you just flattering me here?__EOS__ No. I'm a huge Woody Allen fan. I also, I think that I think of my records as soundtracks in a way. You know, if I had to have someone direct the movie of my life it would be Woody Allen.",2
50133," No. No. I spent 40 years in the military and not all of them as a general, started off as a private. But this I think is sui-generous, but I do think it's simply a blip. But you know, it's a symptom of something that has to be addressed, and Administration and Capitol Hill has to address these issues. And when I say the Administration, the current one and any democratic administration that may come in. __EOS__ General Trainor, thanks very much. __EOS__ My pleasure, Scott. __EOS__ Retired Marine General, Bernard Trainor.

50134," Why tell your mother?__EOS__ You know, once I found out what happened, I sat on that for a good one or two years. I had this great fear that if I find something out and I tell my mother, I could lose her love and lose my brother's love, and be cast out. And yet inside this thing I feared was a truth. And that truth, once I put it out for my mother and brother, it actually answered questions for her that were 40 years old. It brought all of us closer and I think it brought a new life to our family.__EOS__ Another tough question  For those of us who lose a father when we're kids - I recommend a play by Robert Anderson, called ""I Never Sang for My Father."" There's a line in there that goes, ""Death ends a life, but it doesn't end a relationship."" Your father has been gone for some time now, but I know the relationship goes on. So your father had a secret.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.",0
50135,"   I say, `Don't you know?'      You say, `You don't know.'  I say, `Take me out.' __EOS__  Not surprisingly, Franz Ferdinand is a band of contradictions.      Lead singer Alex Kapranos often writes complex ideas and intimate      personal stories and then buries them under a loud, pulsing rhythm.  On      the new album ""You Could Have It So Much Better,"" the first track, ""The      Fallen,"" alludes to a Christlike figures who forces self-righteous people      to reassess their value systems. __EOS__   So you say you're a troubled boy just because      you like to destroy all the things that bring the idiots joy.  Well... __EOS__  If putting an ecclesiastical allegory to a really good dance beat      sounds strange, it shouldn't, says lead singer Alex Kapranos. ",2
50136," It is. It's huge. I mean, California is looking at a cliff. It's been a problem for eight years. We've been warning the politicians that it's coming, they do nothing but sit there and play with brand new contracts with the public employee unions, make more and more financial mandates with initiatives in small print, all of this at the expense of the taxpayers and business. __EOS__ Okay, well, you mentioned unions, let's switch to that topic. And I want to play a little clip from your radio show. __EOS__ Hogue News is up, full of stuff today, just full of stuff today. My attempt to create a coup inside of the state workers force with the unions -enemy number one, by the way. __EOS__ Okay, enemy number one  the unions. But aren't the unions really bearing the brunt of the problems and the pay cuts, the furloughs, the layoffs? The largest union of state workers has already received a 15 percent pay cut. ",3
50137,"  When you look back at everything, is there a particular song      that you'd like to point to and say--maybe not your favorite song,      maybe--but that's what Babyface is? __EOS__  Wow. __EOS__  Not Kenny, but that's Babyface. __EOS__  That's interesting.  That is a really interesting question.      I think the difficulty in answering that is because I've done so many      songs for other people that part of my identity is with them as well, and      going from so many different people, it's kind of hard to put one thing.      I know if that was asked to some people, `Who is Babyface?' some people      would go, `""Whip Appeal,""' you know?  I'll just be happy that pieces of      me were spread a little bit everywhere.

50145," Jorge wanted to create this world that felt handmade with wooden puppets and metal and paint. It really feels very much like a Mexican Baroque.__EOS__ At ""The Book Of Life"" premiere on Sunday, some of the audience members said they were glad Gutierrez's movie got to the screen before a proposed Disney-Pixar film on the same subject. Disney had tried to co-opt the very name of the holiday.__EOS__ I, along with every other Latino pretty much, were outraged and shocked when Disney tried to copyright the term Dia de los Muertos or Day of the Dead.__EOS__ Cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz says he's especially glad ""The Book Of Life"" was directed and produced by two Mexicans.",1
50146," Yeah. Sorry.__EOS__ Oh no. No. You were going to say something.__EOS__ You had a specific question.__EOS__ Oh, yes. So people who saw that, before they even knew that there was a documentary because you were making it at the time - or a mockudocumentary - people thought, like, did you see Joaquin Phoenix on Letterman? God, he's gotten so weird. Like, what's happened to him? So what was it like for you before people had any idea what this was really about, to have all these people thinking that you'd kind of gone off the deep end?",1
50147," Yeah.__EOS__ I mean, I have been through it too.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ Yeah. I read that director, Lisa Cholodenko, liked your lesbian surfer thing.",1
50148," Now, although that's not a moment of actual physical brutality - you're not describing his whipping - that is such a disturbing story, just thinking psychologically of what it must've been like for this man to have to organize slave auctions for other men in his position and then have to basically organize his own sale. It's...__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ It's just mindboggling.__EOS__ Well, and, you know, Frederick Douglass is probably the one who said it best. In his narrative he describes how - over and over he says - the worst part of slavery was not physical. It was not the beating. It was not having a bloody back. It was psychological. It was mental. It was what it did to your mind. It was the constant struggle to fight back with your mind, to find some way that you could still fashion a future.",1
50149," Exactly, exactly. __EOS__ The Zen-ist of all actors. __EOS__ So what does he mean by your Zen approach? __EOS__ Well, you know, I try not to touch the thing. I have to say, there was a time when I started out making records, producing music, that I wanted to control everything. I wanted everything to be - you know, I wrote arrangements out, and I wanted the drummer to play all the beats and the fills that I imagined hearing. And after a few, you know, months or years of that, I got tired of it and realized that I was always more excited by other people's ideas than my own. So my method in going into the studio is to do as little as possible, just to show up and listen really hard until it sounds great. ",2

50151,"  I was laying on my belly, on the middle of the living room floor. I was watching ""Howdy Doody,"" so I'm guessing it was right around 4 when I saw my baby brother tumbling from the top of the stairs. He was lying limp and silent, and the blood was dripping through his shiny hair...__EOS__ This is a literal story? This is what happened?__EOS__ That is a story that was told to me by someone I knew quite well; who had told me one day that they had become an atheist when they were really young. And I asked them why. And that story - more or less, that version of it - was told to me, and really made an impression on me; and I carried it around for a lot of years.__EOS__  ....and that was the the night I learned how not to pray, 'cause God does what he wants to, anyway...",2

50154," Elizabeth, what was your reaction when Tan Dun told you that only was he going to compose a concerto in which you would play a prominent role but that it came complete with this history and story?__EOS__ Well, just as you're listening to Tan's beautiful description, it's like you want more. You want to hear more about this secret society and what's behind the language. And so, I had a voracious appetite. I wanted to find out more and more so I've researched quite a bit. And when I received the videos from Tan last year, to work with these films, it was like the world was starting to open up to me.__EOS__ Composer Tan Dun joined us from our New York bureau. And harpist Elisabeth Hainen spoke to us from the studios of WHYY in Philadelphia.__EOS__ Thank you.",2
50155," Do you feel like these are characters external to you or they're part of you?__EOS__ They are entirely part of me. The laborious process that I engage of writing by hand with pen on white notebook paper, being computer-illiterate, existing outside the digital world - and I've written all 19 of my books in this manner - allows me to sustain concentration - I've come to believe - more deeply, and allows me to live more richly in the text as I compose it.__EOS__ So you're - you live without a computer, without the Internet, all that.__EOS__ I have an assistant. She has a cell phone. She has a computer. She types my books. And I submit hand-written pages to her. I have a fax machine, too.",0
50156," I have to say, you're sounding almost sympathetic - and Epps is a cruel, cruel man.__EOS__ Well, you know, I do feel a bit of sympathy for Epps because, you know, he's in this system where he has to uphold, and he does uphold it - with an iron fist. But at the same time, he's in love with this slave - called Patsey - and he can't understand why is he in love with this slave? And he goes about destroying his love for her, which is basically destroying her physically. And that kind of perversity is sort of inherent in slavery, not just through this weird love story. And it manifests itself within horrible acts of violence. But at the same time, you know, he's a human being.__EOS__ Hmm. I want to talk to you about, I think, was the most stunning scene in a movie that has a lot of stunning scenes. There comes a time when Solomon thrashes one of his white bosses, and they nearly hang him; but Solomon Northup is cut down just enough that his toes are touching the ground. This scene goes on for minutes on screen, and it seems like a pastoral painting with a horror at its center.__EOS__ I mean, it was a norm. Death and torture was the norm. And you see how people sort of get used to it, get numb to it. So, for example, you see in that shot when he's hanging there, slaves going about their business and not interfering with him hanging there. Yes, I wanted it in the film to be sort of the lynching of all lynchings in film, because somehow this had to portray all of what happened in the past, which never got brought into the light.",1
50157," Well, you know, the last record was really an interesting record to make, because I had gone through the breast cancer thing and the public breakup and adopted a child, and had not really sat down to write anything, and consciously so, because I didn't want to go to music to sort of bury the emotion of it all. I really wanted to experience it in order to be done with it. __EOS__ But is - are you saying that sometimes if you write about something too soon it's almost like you are performing yourself? Youre not - it's not authentic unless - is that - you know what I mean? I'm trying to understand how that... __EOS__ I think emotionally it's really authentic. I think for me, when you go to your work it sort of fortifies that that belief system that we Westerners have, which is oh, I know you're going through a hard time. Just try to stay busy. Try not to think about it. And ultimately, the real learning and the real growth comes from experiencing our emotions, you know, that's where the awakening really occurs. __EOS__ Oh, tell me about the urgency. That's where I interrupted you. You were saying that something about being a mom... ",2
50158," We didn't have a way to get back to the time without, you know, a count off, and Hal, you know, said let me just hit the drum, the bass drum. Everyone will know when to come in. __EOS__ The surviving members of ""The Wrecking Crew"" are all on hand as well. What emerges is a touching portrait of overqualified jazz musicians who initially grumbled about having to play on crap rock 'n' roll records, but who eventually moved into big mansions and drove shiny Jaguars to their never-ending recording dates. __EOS__ I didn't care for rock 'n' roll that much. I was basically a jazz drummer. But I realized that I'm making my living off it. If I'm going to continue to do that, I've got to play that like that's my favorite music. It's not beneath you if it's supporting you. __EOS__ One of the clever production touches Tedesco employs is having the individual musicians play their instruments alone, then fading in the famous record that lick was a part of. Bass player Carol Kaye, the only woman to join ranks with the Crew, is recalled by Brian Wilson as being the greatest bass player in the world. Carol then plays the very notes Brian wrote for ""Good Vibrations,"" returning the compliment by saying, you knew this kid was into something really, really great. ",2
50159," Now, the article mentions that you once served as a Unitarian Universalist minister and I'd like to ask how your faith informs your work and I also hope you tell us as briefly as you can - because I understand it's a very complicated story because it's a complicated issue - how you decided that this work was work you were willing to do.__EOS__ That's two questions.__EOS__ It is.__EOS__ The first question of being a Unitarian minister at Johns Hopkins University - basically, I was a lay minister who was responsible for Johns Hopkins students who were Unitarian Universalists. And that was interesting and good and, sometimes when we had complicated issues, we would bring up and invite other people in with the possibility of the students to meeting them. But most of the students were not interested.",3
50160," But there's not much of a tour. It's a couch. It has television, a bed and a big computer. __EOS__ And that's pretty much my world. __EOS__ One thing that amazes me, I don't see any albums here. As somebody who is a DJ for decades… __EOS__ Yeah. ",2
50161," Right.__EOS__ And I'm just Brian, you know?__EOS__ And so where is your money invested? In gold, in livestock, is it under your mattress?__EOS__ You just asked me the question I told you you'd be an idiot to ask.",0
50162,"  I need you?__EOS__ She's like, I need...__EOS__  I don't know what you're talking about.__EOS__ And then she realizes she gave it up. She gave up the information he was looking for.",1
50163," Let's take a listen here.__EOS__  About 20 years ago, on a train bound for nowhere, I met up with a gambler; we were both too tired to sleep. So we took turns staring through the window at the darkness, till boredom overtook us; and he commenced to speak.__EOS__ So just listening to those lines, Kenny Rogers, he doesn't say, ""on a warm summer's evening""; he says, ""about 20 years ago."" He doesn't say ""he began to speak""; he says, ""he commenced to speak.""__EOS__ Commenced to speak, yeah.",2
50164," My guest is David Gilbert, author of the new novel ""And Sons."" We'll talk more after a break.__EOS__ My guest is David Gilbert. His new novel called ""And Sons"" is about a famous reclusive novelist and his relationship with his sons. Earlier, we were talking about Gilbert's relationship with his father, a former chairman of Morgan Stanley.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ ...and how you're able to communicate more emotionally than you used to be able to, you said in a recent interview that there was a time when you used to like imagine eulogies you'd say at your father's funeral in which you could really express your feelings about him the things that you wish you could say if you are braver. Did you stop doing that?",0
50165,"  The problem is, youve been told and not told. That's what I've seen while I've been here. Youve been told but none of you really understand, so I've decided I'll tell it to you in a way that you will understand. __EOS__ Well, Mark Romanek, welcome to FRESH AIR. __EOS__ Thank you very much. __EOS__ That's, of course, from your film ""Never Let Me Go."" Sally Hawkins, one of the teachers at this school, Hailsham, telling the kids the truth about the lives that they will lead. And she - in the film she goes ahead and reveals their fates. How much do you want to tell audiences about what's actually in store for these kids, what theyve been prepared for? ",1
50166," Well, Paul Simon, thanks very much. __EOS__ Thank you for having me. __EOS__  I'm working on the rewrite, that's right. I'm going to change the ending. Going to throw away my title and toss it in the trash. Every minute after midnight, all the time... __EOS__ Paul Simon's latest album is called ""So Beautiful or So What."" He sings. You decide. You can hear album in its entirety at NPRMusic.org. ",2
50167," So, your 2003 memoir says that as a kid back in 1957, you were taken to an Elvis Presley concert.__EOS__ That's true.__EOS__ And that after that you were done, you were over, you knew what path you wanted to take.__EOS__ Is that all right?",2
50168," Well, your book takes a look at black masculinity by focusing on different black men, by looking at relationships between black men and black women; it includes a chapter on black gay men, which you didn't name, but what I like to call Tyrone and Tyrone.  __EOS__ And there's much more. So first, what spurred you to write this book, and why did you feel that Tyrone needed to be deconstructed? Who's going to - Natalie H., why don't we begin with you?  __EOS__ Okay, well, we decided to do this project a few years ago because we wanted to do something outside the daily grind of the newspaper business. We wanted to do a project that reflected our experiences as black feminists of the hip-hop generation. And we felt that Tyrone, as you said, it has become this archetype, and it often has very little to do with the reality of most black men's lives in our generation. So this project really looks to dispel some of those myths and complicate our ideas of what Tyrone is.  __EOS__ Well, you have so much in this book. There is ""The Pole Test,"" interviews with strippers about their relationships with their fathers, the whole phenomenon of what we call babydaddy, black men at work. And I was just wondering, what chapter was the most interesting to both of you? Natalie Hopkinson?  ",0
50169," Uh-huh. Well, I guess there lies the difference between you and I.__EOS__ I think that, too. Don't, I really am. I'm with you. I sometimes think I wish I could have better represented my point of view more forcefully and whatnot. And then I think and when that didn't work I wish I had a gun.__EOS__ Right. Okay.__EOS__ Yeah.",3
50170," I hope it does because I think it would be really fun to try and make this movie. But I guess these movie things take a long time so...__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ Well, we'll see what happens with the movie end of it.__EOS__ Black Francis. He's written a new novel - if that's what you call it - together with Josh Frank and illustrated by Steven Appleby, ""The Good Inn."" Thanks so much for being with us.",0
50171," Right, a real one. Your metro stop.__EOS__ My home metro stop.__EOS__ And you're reading the paper, the Washington Sun, in which there's an article about the protagonist Nick. Was the cameo part of your deal?__EOS__ No, no. They were just really sweet and asked me to do it. And I was, you know, I was appalled to, when I arrived at the Cleveland Park Metro stop to find there were like 40 human beings involved in making that three second clip, including you know D.C. Police who were, you know, having to. So it's tremendously complicated making a film. I've learned quite a lot. You know, it's tremendously, from an equipment point of view, being a writer is very easy. As I think William Faulkner once said, all a writer needs is a piece of paper, a pencil and a bottle of whiskey.",0
50172," Sure, yeah. And I guess it's just the bottom line is it's very simple. It's you either have it or you don't, you know. You can learn the read the music out of a chart, you know, but when it's in your blood and you're born with it and, you know, and it's a gift, it just comes naturally to you. And...__EOS__ I would say that every instrument that somebody plays and feels, they got that passion to that certain instrument. I mean, they put all their heart to it, you know, that - because it's a gift.__EOS__ Yeah. With Flaco and myself, it's more about the feeling. You know, you're feeling your instrument and you're feeling the moment. And so, yeah, you know, we got in the studio and we had a couple of beers, you know, and just kind of grooved a little bit and rolled the tape and let's go, you know.__EOS__ And then we had another beer.",1
50173," For at least the next few months. And then when he comes down, he looks at the guy in the face, and Obama looks ashen. And nobody's really talked about that. He looks like a guy who's like - for a minute I thought maybe this was over. And, you know, I'm sure he's aware of the responsibility and how, you know, nobody's ever picked him up like that. And then - you know, and yet I connect that in some way...__EOS__ So let's talk about your background. Where did you grow up?__EOS__ I grew up all over, but I went to high school in Chicago. And then I moved from Chicago to San Francisco 15 years ago. But I was born in Palo Alto, lived in Indianapolis, lived in Boston. My dad's from Alabama, so I spent a lot of time in Alabama.__EOS__ How come you moved so much?",3
50174," I don't know.__EOS__ ...Germany was going to sell - Russia was going to sell to Germany for 30 billion pounds, to pay off  Berlin.__EOS__ Well, that was at a different time. Russia's in a very different situation now. Robert Kaplan, thank you very much for your time today.__EOS__ It was my pleasure, Neal.",0
50175," Juan Williams, let me ask you. This iconic way of life; this is something that's idealized a lot in American society, the idea of the simple life. In fact, when you look at the life of a farmer, and you mention this, this is not simple. It's, it requires a huge variety of skills and it requires the guts of a gambler. __EOS__ It really does, Neal. I think it's deceptive, and that's one of the things I mentioned in the essay, was, you know, you look at this life, and you think, oh my gosh, you know, such a simple time, you know, in the past, where people could simply work the earth, and they would get the fruit of their labors, and they would go to market. Your family's all lives on the farm, the children work on the farm, the, you know. But you stop and you think about it, and having to manage the economics. __EOS__ And, John Ficara. __EOS__ Ther is, it really is a gamble for many farmers, family farms these days. And it was very apparent to me as well, in traveling around the country, that those farms that were doing well, the children were more likely to continue in the tradition of their parents and grandparents, and farm. Those farms that were struggling, and that were really on the edge of just hanging in there, the children more likely would leave and work off the farm. And... ",0
50176," We were too slow to play receiver, not big enough to play defense or offensive line, so it just kind of worked out that way. __EOS__ Peyton Manning, did you ever take your little brother aside and say, you know, maybe you'd be better playing defense? __EOS__ No, I really didn't. When I was in college and Eli started playing high school football, kind of our philosophy then and it still is today was that he had to come to me to ask questions. You know, I never would go to him and say, hey Eli, here's how you got to throw. Here's how you have to read this defense. And I tried to help him anyway I can, but only if he asked me first. __EOS__ Did you ever argue about that? ",0
50177," You interview a lot of people, and the most important thing during interviews is to have the person talk, and then you can figure out, well, he's lying here, he's not lying there, you know. Maybe he's trying to hide something here. And interrogating terrorists, or interrogating criminals, it's the same. __EOS__ Now, you write that after Abu Zubaydah had been interrogated for a while, there was a gentleman who arrived, you name him as Boris. What was Boris's background and what did he want to do? __EOS__ At the time, we were really surprised, because we had a good team on the ground, and then we found that someone hired this psychologist, supposedly an expert. And when I spoke with him about his level of expertise, we were dumbfounded. The person never interrogated a person in his life. He doesn't know much about al-Qaida, and you need to know a lot about the subject that you're interrogating in order to get actionable intelligence. __EOS__ But you quote him saying, I do know human nature. ",0
50178," the young fruit seller who touched off the uprising by setting himself on fire, the mass protests that spread around the country, the dictator who abandoned his presidential palace and fled. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ You translate into Arabic text, some of the finest literature in the world. To name just a couple  Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Mario Vargas Llosa -Nobel Prize winners, both. Is there a story or a piece of literature that you would say, in a way, this was us, this was Tunisia? __EOS__ Look, there is a novel, very interesting novel, written by a Tunisian novelist who lives in France. The name of the writer is Bubecker Ayetti. The title of this novel is ""The Last Citizen."" This writer tried to publish this book in Tunisia but could not, so he published it in France. It deals with the atmosphere - the oppressive atmosphere of the Tunisian society at the time of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. ",0
50179," Morricone? __EOS__ Henry Mancini for real, and Ennio Morricone, yeah. Nina Rota. The Italian guys to me are really the best because they really seem to break a lot of rules. But Ennio was just, you know, whatever. Got a guy whistling, somebody's making weird noises, you know, with their mouth. __EOS__ You have a professional whistler, Guerin Barry. __EOS__ Yeah, Guerin Barry, really incredible. When you bring in a professional whistler, just be ready because the guy's life is about whistling. ",3
50180," Let's get Nathan on the line, Nathan calling from Salt Lake City. __EOS__ Hi, how you doing, Neal? __EOS__ Very well, thanks. __EOS__ Good. You know, I just had the comment to make. I just returned from Iraq about six months ago. I'm an officer in the Army National Guard. And listening to this story, I, you know it doesn't surprise me, to an extent, that soldiers can get to that point. It does kind of surprise - and it really concerns me that the leadership was not held accountable for that. When somebody goes and tells their leadership that that's going on, that, you know, the leadership - it's incumbent upon the leadership to do something to stop that kind of behavior. And just as the soldiers on the ground committing the atrocities are guilty of war crimes, their leadership, all the way up the chain of command, that knew about it or even had a hint about it really are very guilty of the same things because their job - you know, when a soldier's on the ground in the situation, it doesn't take that much to push a soldier to that point. ",0
50181," Well, it sounds bizarre, but we went to the de facto World Target Vomiting Championships, and these guys... __EOS__ I had to ask. __EOS__ You had to  I'm sorry, but they drink food coloring beforehand. They run a mile. They paddle their surfboard a mile. Then they must drink a six-pack of beer, warm beer, inside 15 minutes, and then they have mastered the art of target vomiting. __EOS__ whack. The artistry, the target  and the color of it because they drink in all this food coloring. It was sort of a fire hydrant out of Willy Wonka or something. And to stand there was amazing until I realized, oh, crap. Someone could get me. And at that moment, one of the better players painted me across the chest and I ran for the Pacific Ocean. And at that point, I didn't think it was all that beautiful. ",0
50182," Which is a powerful insight. So tell us a little bit more about what the difference is between the perception many Americans have of China and the other billion, as you put it. __EOS__ Right. So that was the president of Guizhou University who asked me to call him President Bill because Bill Clinton was his hero, which is a little bit bizarre. But his point was if we only read The New York Times, we're going to understand Shanghai and Beijing. We might understand Tibet and the Dalai Lama. But that leaves out a billion people in the middle and those were the very people that I was getting to know every day. __EOS__ You write about this. You say one of your students, Jennifer, said, you are lucky, because as an American Jew, you have something to believe in. But what can Chinese believe in? We do not have the god. We are losing all of our Chinese days, like Mid-Autumn Festival and Grave Sweeping Day. Do you think that's a widespread view? __EOS__ I think that it's very widespread. I think that the big challenge for the Chinese government - and I think that they know this - is actually to rebuild some sort of tradition. And what's interesting is the Chinese government has been promoting Confucianism as a return to Chinese values. So there's Confucian centers being built all over the country. ",0
50183," Do you have a favorite one in the book, a favorite song? __EOS__ You know, these songs, if you're traveling through India, for instance, you hear them everywhere. And, you know, if you're walking down a bizarre street, there will be four radios playing different songs at the same time. __EOS__   __EOS__ The sense of that is, tell me where are you in this intoxicating night. And so what Sartaj does is that, instead of going home, he follows the auto rickshaw so that they can listen to the entire song. And that's a moment that I think anybody who's lived in a city in India has participated in at one point or the other. You know, going out of your way because you've heard this lilting music in the distance, and you just want to have it to yourself for a few minutes before you have to face the traffic again. ",0
50184, Do you have your book with you? __EOS__ I have a copy of it right here. __EOS__ Excellent. __EOS__ It is going to be some sort of gotcha moment? ,0
50185," Roy Scranton and Captain Jake Siegel will be back in the second half of the show. They're editors of and contributors to the book ""Fire and Forget,"" a collection of short stories by veterans. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with veterans and writers Roy Scranton and Jake Siegel. Scranton served with the Army in Iraq, Siegel is a captain in the New York National Guard and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. They're both editors of and contributors to a collection of short stories by veterans called ""Fire and Forget."" Siegel also edits ""The Hero Project"" blog for The Daily Beast.__EOS__ So I would say that when I was younger, before I went to Iraq, I had thought about death as a, you know, I think the way most people think about something fundamentally unknowable, which was this kind of abstract thing that needed to be reckoned with - I guess. What ended up happening, I did convoy security in Iraq also, and IEDs were blowing up all the time, and they were lethal. And death, rather than being something that you meditated on - or for me it wasn't something, I didn't think about death, the meaning of death, my own death. I thought about death in objects. It produced for me a fear of objects and of things, and an adaptive fear. Like Roy is saying, how too much imaginative leaping or too much imagination is, can actually be dangerous in that sort of environment. It's not just that it takes your mind to dark places; it's that, you know, you want to see something for what it is. So you want to see a rock for a rock, an IED for an IED. And so the fear in those situations of death is the fear of the thing that brings death, I think. It's the fear of the instrument of death. It's - and that was a powerful thing and something that created a kind of - disciplined the mind in a certain way that was utterly exhausting and that I would never want to go back to. It demanded a certain kind of, you know, myopic concentration on a very narrow - a very narrow range of things, all of which dealt with danger, violence or the response to those. And it produced a feeling unlike other feelings, having to deal with that a kind of tightness and tension and singular-ness of purpose that was powerful and was also exhausting.__EOS__ It sounds like you have to train yourself to be a catastrophist, to think that like every rock might really be an IED and that might really mean catastrophe.",0
50186," Yes.__EOS__ ...Members of the media and the public during the voir dire proceedings, which this jury-vetting that you were talking about. What's all that about?__EOS__ We have several corruption trials going on here in New Orleans. And one of the cases involves a juror who overheard something in an elevator and then changed the way they voted on a panel. So judges are really antsy at this point about mixing the public and the media with potential jurors and jurors. So I can see why they want to keep us apart. But, good heavens. We have to leave our equipment, our laptops, our cell phones, everything on a separate floor. We can't get anywhere near these folks.__EOS__ All right, Eileen Fleming is a reporter at member station WWNO in New Orleans, and she was kind enough to join us by phone from New Orleans. Eileen, thanks so much for bringing us up to date. Keep us posted, if you will.",3
50187," Now that you guys have come together, I want to ask each of you - let me start with you, Wynton Marsalis - is there something you've learned from Willie Nelson that you'll take back? __EOS__ Definitely. I think he's really has been on the road for so long and he's contributed so much. If you walk with him on the street and you see the way people love him, his integrity and who he is, he's so much himself, he's very relaxed. So I'd say one thing I learned from him in rehearsal - and I'm not even going to talk about musical things; I'm just going to talk about just as a man - you know, the natural order of things between older and younger people and the progression of life and the things you learn. __EOS__ And I'll ask you, Willie Nelson, what will you take away from playing with Wynton Marsalis? __EOS__ Did you ask me a question? ",2
50188," Now, you write that, I think, 50 percent of the claims for post-traumatic stress disorder are turned down by the private insurance companies that insure civilian contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. So how does that compare to the rate that the military medical system turns down? __EOS__ Well, here's an important distinction to make between the two systems. The military system, everyone who has - claims they have PTSD has access to a military doctor. The problems come in when they also claim they were disabled by that injury. __EOS__ How do we pay for these expensive, long-term psychological treatments that may be necessary in this case? How do we, you know, deal with that and address that issue? And so these private insurance companies have essentially become a private VA system for the civilian contractors who have had psychological injuries. __EOS__ T. Christian Miller will be back in the second half of the show. He's an investigative reporter with ProPublica. His series is called ""Disposable Army  Civilian Contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. ",0
50189, Or at...__EOS__ That's where I can't wait to see Dr. Earle next.__EOS__ Yeah. I can't wait for her to finish up one of those new submarines...__EOS__ Me too.,3
50190," It wasn't my intention to populate it with jerky guys. I certainly didn't mean that. I think everybody is a little weak. I think that guy in ""Or Else"" is a sympathetic fellow, and it's funny because I've gotten email and letters from people essentially saying I feel like that character is me. I like him a lot, too.  He's a liar, but he's working so hard to belong to this family. And in a way, I think of him as being sort of like me, a kind of - a person who has to invent a story in order to feel as if he or she fits in. __EOS__ Ms. Nelson, thank you so much for all of your time.  __EOS__ Thank you very much.  __EOS__ Antonya Nelson, her new collection of short stories is called ""Nothing Right."" You can read an excerpt from her stories on our Web site, npr.org.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0
50191," Were you embarrassed about that, or more angry, or both?__EOS__ I was mortified, absolutely mortified and angry. I hadn't called for the Coast Guard. I'd run into a storm about 10 days off the California coast, and the wind speed was, oh, I don't know, 40 or 50 knots, and the waves were about 20 feet high. And my boat's only 23 feet. The first time the boat capsized was at night, and I was in the cabin. I was actually in there strapped down to my bunk. But on the second capsize, those straps pulled out from the floor of the cabin, so then after that, when the boat capsized again, I was being thrown around a bit like a rag doll in a washing machine.__EOS__ That sounds terrifying. That sounds totally terrifying.__EOS__ It's certainly miserable. I didn't think I was going to die, because, by this point, I'd already spent three and a half months in my boat on the Atlantic, and I knew that it was a strong boat and that it could withstand some pretty horrendous conditions.",3
50192," My pleasure. Thank you.__EOS__ Jasmin, this project, which began this really stunning book, all began after your father's death with this photograph I just referenced falling out of a stack of letters. What was that moment like for you to see this picture?__EOS__ It was absolutely staggering. My father had just died, in fact, and I was grief stricken at that moment, but even so, I was absolutely stunned by the discovery of this picture. It didn't square with anything I knew about my mother. It didn't square with anything I knew even about Iran, so it was a moment, really, that upended much of what I believed in about my family's past.__EOS__ And when you asked her about it, what did she say?",0
50193," The title of your book refers to the notorious Milgram experiments. One element of their notoriety was the situation they put unsuspecting people in, the people who were the subjects of these experiments.__EOS__ Yes. Well, I think it depends on your point of view about what makes them notorious. Certainly, for people in academia and scholars, the ethical issues involved in Milgram's experiment have always been a hot issue. They were from the very beginning. And Milgram's experiment really ignited a debate, particularly in social sciences, about what was acceptable to put human subjects through.__EOS__ Here's one of the people who unwittingly was the teacher in one of these experiments half a century ago. Bill Menold is one of people you found and tracked down as he was presented in your radio documentary.__EOS__ The thought of quitting never - it's really strange. It never occurred to me to say, you know what, I'm walking out of here, which I could've done. And it was like being in a situation that you never thought you would be in, not really being able to think clearly, being so far out of your own world of experiences, because that's all you know.",0
50194," So did you and Clint Eastwood agree on your interpretations of Hoover and his motivations, the reasons behind his paranoia?__EOS__ Yes, we did. And yes, we do. But we have a generational divide in terms of vocabulary, which is often fascinating in the interviews because people ask him, well, do you think J. Edgar Hoover was gay? And he says, I don't know.__EOS__ Well, Dustin Lance Black, it's really been great to talk with you again. Congratulations on the film, and thanks so much.__EOS__ Oh, thank you for having me.",1
50195," Do you think people in Alabama are still paying for the sins of 1901, in that case? __EOS__ That's correct. But the country has changed and hopefully, the courts have changed. And hopefully, this will be struck down. __EOS__ But you have this state constitution, which is so encyclopedic that it does everything from banning duels to explaining how - one of my favorites -how Alabama would acquire foreign territory. I don't fully understand that. __EOS__ What you're really saying is, then we would have to actually pass a modern constitution that would allow local counties, local municipalities to solve their own problems, and not have the people in my county, Lee County, vote on the prohibition of weeds, junk, motor vehicles and litter in Jefferson County. That's Amendment 497, which is really not of great interest to the people down in my area, and yet we have to vote on that. ",3
50196," Well, they named me, first of all, adopted son. And usually you have to be dead before that happens. But... __EOS__ So, the last street that they opened, they gave it my name. __EOS__ Were you introduced to the art of Spanish classical guitar when you were there? Because, you know, after all, I mean, Andres Segovia, he was the classical guitar player. __EOS__ . ",2
50197," What does that mean? __EOS__ I'm not telling you again. __EOS__ All right. __EOS__ CFR, that's the Code of Federal Regulations. Yikes. We avoid a citation - this time. ",0
50198," The OxyContin being changing in 2010 did bring on a lot more heroin users because there were so many people across the country addicted to OxyContin. It was called hillbilly heroin. And I think that increased heroin demand.__EOS__ Oxycontin is a prescription drug. And what happened was the formula was changed - that it wasn't as easy to crush up or - what was it about the change in the formula of OxyContin that made some people transition to heroin?__EOS__ It was harder to crush up, and it was also a lot more expensive. And for some reason, it became a lot less available. You know, a bottle of oxy would cost around $80, when you could get high off of heroin for, I think, like $10, depending on your tolerance. But it's like, 800 percent difference; like, you'd go broke to maintain that habit, although heroin seemed to be a lot cheaper habit that almost anybody could do it. In some places in Vermont, heroin is, you know, the easiest drug to get right now.__EOS__ Sometimes when there is a problem like this, people believe it's outsiders coming in, bringing the problem to them. And I'm wondering, do people there - are they owning the problem as their problem? Or is it seen as outsiders bringing, like, their big-city ways to Vermont?",3
50199," Well look here, I mean in Europe I have absolutely no problem. I did an erotic book which is based on the ""Kama Sutra."" But instead of human beings, the positions are taken up by frogs, you know?__EOS__ And people come to me and say, you know, I was brought up with you. It's called the ""Kama Sutra of Frogs."" And as I say, you know, I was 13 years old and I saved money to buy your ""Kama Sutra."" I had already been brought up with your books. It's no problem. You know, I've been ambassador at the European Council for Childhood and Education and my eroticism has never bothered anyone.__EOS__ In the documentary about you, you say that you still have nightmares many nights and in those nightmares you're often being arrested - which was your big fear when you were growing up, that the Germans would arrest you or your mother.__EOS__ Yeah. Yeah. We were arrested once by the Gestapo. But my - that's in my book, and my mother was brilliant. She was a great comedian. You see, the Nazis arrived and within three - after three months it was forbidden to speak a word of French. You could be arrested for a bonjour or just a merci. Just any word in French you could be immediately arrested. And I had to learn German in three months - which shows you that with a knife on your, you know, on your neck, you can learn a language in three months. It's my brother who taught me.",1
50200," Oh, so what did she say? What did the real ex-girlfriend say when she saw the movie? __EOS__ Amazingly, amazingly, we don't speak anymore. __EOS__ Oh, shocking. Right, okay. __EOS__ Yeah. ",1
50201," Define that to me. __EOS__ A vamp is the music that comes before the actual melody. For instance, Wilkommen starts with a vamp.  __EOS__ Let's talk a little bit about your work in the theater, in the musical theater, particularly in the four decade long partnership you had with Fred Ebb. The first big show that you did together was Flora, The Red Menace. __EOS__ Actually Flora was the first show that we ever had produced. And a song in it called A Quiet Thing that is one of the personal favorite songs that Fred and I wrote together. I think it's a wonderful lyric and I think it says something that people just don't think about. ",2
50202," I see Dick once in a while. I make him laugh about that now.__EOS__ Here's an email from Lee in Memphis  On the ""Monterey Pop"" DVD is an extended video of Buddy playing there. This was in the summer of 1967, and Jimi Hendrix, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and many others played there as well. What was it like for a real Chicago blues man like yourself to see and hear all of those young guys doing what you had been doing for years?__EOS__ Well, you know, it's always, so far as I'm concerned, it's not enough. You know, as I said, I didn't learn nothing from the books. And whoever pick up an instrument - trust me, I don't just listen to guitar players. You know, I tried to steal licks from my drummer if I can, the late great Below who played all the drums at Chess on all the shuffles. I used to look at him and say, man, what was that lick you played there? Because he would triple up. He could snap those wrists and play a lick like that, and him and I used to play by ourself when we were making about 50 cents or 75 cents a night.__EOS__ Hmm. Buddy Guy with David Ritz, the author of ""When I Left Home  My Story."" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",2
50203," So when people borrow things from other people, I think they should do so respectfully. __EOS__ Mm hmm. __EOS__ Maybe we'd rather they didn't. That depends on your attitude to royalty. __EOS__ Right. ",0
50204," Bing, and have the bell come right there. We have two drummers by the way. A lot of people think we use stenographers, but they can't do it because they can't make their fingers move fast enough. So we have drummers because they can get wrist action. So they play… __EOS__ And this goes back on the beat. __EOS__ It is. You have to tamp down all the middle keys so that only the two outside ones work. And you have to start with your right hand in order to be able to hit the carriage return where Anderson specifies. __EOS__ The composer's music has been a favorite of Slatkin's for years. The departing music director of the National Symphony Orchestra is known for presenting concerts both of challenging contemporary music and popular American composers. He points out that Anderson's music has always been popular. ",2
50205," Okay. So, let's see. Here we start with A is for abuela and abandoned car. __EOS__ An abuela is a grandmother. __EOS__ That's right. You know, I think one of the defining features for me growing up in my neighborhood was an older generation from Puerto Rico who had an open-door policy, in what many considered, from the outside, to be a dangerous neighborhood. But, in fact, this open-door policy is what kept people safe. It was how children were supervised playing outside. And it's how, you know, a hungry neighbor could be fed after work if they didn't have time to go home and cook, if they didn't have money to go and get something from, you know, the corner restaurant. __EOS__ Now, right off in the A's, there's an abandoned car. It's not too tough, but that - real clearly, this is not an affluent neighborhood. ",0

My father. If I didn't know this white man was crazy before, I sure knew it then.” __EOS__ So, let's go to the moment that you were just reading from in your book. When you mother died, the man that you called daddy couldn't keep you. Why was that? __EOS__ Because he wasn't my biological father. He was my step dad. He had been my daddy since I was two years old. And there's a law in California that gives the biological parent first choice of custody of the children when a parent dies. __EOS__ Tell us about the death of your mother, which was a pivotal experience in your life.

50208," Well, the timing of the discovery was perhaps unfortunate, but certainly dramatic. It was right at the time of the declaration of the state of Israel. All the scrolls of the initial batch - but that was only seven scrolls from Cave 1 - actually ended up in Jewish hands, and you can see them today in the Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem, which was a museum that was built specially for them. And so Jewish scholars worked on those. But then after the division of Palestine, Qumran and the rest of the scrolls were in Jordan, and that is why no Jews were allowed to work on them.__EOS__ Because they were in Jordan?__EOS__ Because they were in Jordan. I mean, no Jews were allowed to be on the official editorial team and were not allowed to see the original manuscripts, except for the seven that had been acquired by Israelis.__EOS__ And was this because of the Jordanian government, in protest over the creation of the state of Israel?",0

You can still find Drink Me's      music on that label, but the band's timing was way off. __EOS__  When we started, if we could've driven around in a van and      toured for $20 a night, that would've been a big step up for us.  And,      unfortunately, when we finally did get a chance to make a record and      tour--that was, like, 12 years later--we weren't young men anymore. __EOS__   Oh, when will they let me go back home?  Have they      condemned me to this throne? ",2
50210," Thank you, Michel. It's great to be on your show.__EOS__ Now, this may sound like a stupid question, but when you were campaigning, did it occur to you that this might be the case, that there might be this history-making event? Or was it one of those things that just wasn't on your radar until it actually happened?__EOS__ No. People were talking about it, particularly toward the end as Maggie Hassan became such a strong candidate for governor and as the two congressional seats started to look like they were going to elect women. I should add that the chief justice of our Supreme Court is also a woman. So people were getting very excited about being first in the nation.__EOS__ So anytime other people are making a big deal out of something, I like to ask the people about whom the big deal is being made if it's a big deal to them. Is it a big deal to you? Do you think it's a big deal?",3
50211," Absolutely. It was really of the highest compliments and one of the most embarrassing moments in my life. Yes, it was a horrible.__EOS__ A compliment?__EOS__ Yes, very much so. Think about it. OK, time's up. Pearl Bailey was one of the biggest stars of our time, and that she felt not only did she want the song for herself, and also, she wasn't anxious for my face to be facing the audience, which she felt that somehow that was a threat to her. So yes, that was a compliment.__EOS__ Do you understand why she did what she did?",0
50212," I think the president came out with his gloves off last night. I mean, he told the American people what they needed to hear as far as the economy, as far as jobs, what his plan is. It sounds like he has a plan in action. But, you know, its just lip service. Theres a lot of people that are angry and have a lot of cynicism toward Washington right now. __EOS__ Yourself included? __EOS__ Myself included, you know. I mean, youre going to give results, you know, and this year will be telling. __EOS__ When we spoke last week, you told me that you wanted people in Washington to recognize how vital blue collar workers are to this country. Did you get that sense? ",3
50213," ""Natural Woman"" has a story about that. I mean, in the book I have the story of how we got the title of ""Natural Woman"" from Jerry Wexler and then we went home and then we made the demo and then they took the demo and ran with it. And all the people and all the layers and, of course, the great Aretha Franklin recorded it. And it's just a remarkable feeling to hear a song of yours come back with all the embellishments that you didn't quite imagine, but you sort of had in your head and there they are, only even better. That's joy.__EOS__ But you knew all those gospel chords. You can hear that on the demo.__EOS__ Yeah. I did. I was listening to a lot of what they then called black music.__EOS__ So, let's hear those two versions back to back now - your demo and Aretha Franklin.",2
50214," So having deeply immersed yourself in the story of Wonder Woman and in the Wonder Woman comics, what do you think of them now? Do you find them enjoyable? Were you a fan of them before? Are you a fan of them now?__EOS__ No, I was never a fan. I never read comic books as a kid. I was far too much of a geek to do that. I remember watching the Lynda Carter TV show, which started in '75, '76 and then switching to watch ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" because I kind of had a crush on him. But I didn't, you know, like my brother watched Lynda Carter and Wonder Woman. I got fascinated by the story because I'm a political historian. It seemed to me there was a really important political story that had been missed, that is sort of invisible - basically as invisible as Wonder Woman's jet, if you just read the comic books, so I do have a different appreciation for them. But I actually had an experience just recently that really carried home to me the force of Wonder Woman and why so many women that I meet tell me oh my God, I always loved Wonder  Woman when I was a kid. I had the lunchbox; I dressed up as Wonder Woman for every Halloween. I had the doll; my brother once stole it and I had to beat him up. Like, you know, women my age have incredible attachment to this character, although they know nothing about her. And I was always kind of puzzled by that because the kinkiness kind of came across to me more. But I was sitting in my kitchen table with a little girl who was 8 years old, who's over visiting, kid who's in foster care. And we were just looking for something to do and she found this box of postcards I have on my kitchen shelf and they're covers of original DC Comics from the 1940s. She started picking them. She pulled out all of the Wonder Womans and she lined them up in a row and she just looked at them. And then she looked at me and she said she is so strong. It just knocked me out. This is why - this is why Wonder Woman touches people.__EOS__ Jill Lepore, thank you for talking with us and thank you for writing this really interesting book.__EOS__ Thanks, it was a lot of fun.",0

50216," Alejandro Escovedo says what he finally learned about life he learned from music. He comes from a musical family. Several of his brothers are musicians. Two of them played with Santana. His niece is Sheila E. His father was a Mexican immigrant who played in Mariachi bands and influenced Escovedo, even though he started as a punk rocker. __EOS__  My suicide child. My suicide child, you stole my junk, you low down punk. Down, down, down, down, down... __EOS__ Is there anything you learned from your father that has that has carried over to your music, even though you're playing such different music? __EOS__ I think everything that I know about music, in a way, I learned from my father and my older brothers - the way to listen, the space in music, the compositional quality of rock and roll - even, you know, in just trying to fit different sounds and textures into songs.

I'm not trying to make a point      or anything like that.  This story, you know, if I don't tell it, Oliver      Stone will, and he'll get it all wrong, so... __EOS__  Well.  You... ",0

And      I feel like a very, very lucky girl. __EOS__  Aaaaah... ",2
50221," Thank you.__EOS__ I want to start out by talking about the cover of the book. There is a very small, petite young woman on the cover in a gray dress. She is reclined on an oriental rug, and next to her is a full staff that's been mounted, and a 19th century pistol, and four antique guns are hanging on the wall. What's the story here?__EOS__ Her name is Greta. Her dad is an antique gun dealer. And what was fascinating is that you look at her and you think, oh, this was just a beautifully posed picture and that she has no relationship to guns. She's been shooting ever since she was a child. And there was a PBS special on Annie Oakley where the producer had seen her shooting clay pigeons, and they hired her to play the young Annie Oakley in the PBS special.__EOS__ Why women and guns? How did this idea kind of congeal for you, of all the things you could focus on?",0

50223," We should say what happened - what became of the Jewish population of Italy, which was subject to these racial laws which, you know, initially had dealt with, you know, banning them from certain occupations, banning kids from public schools, but did not, you know, mean that there were Italian concentration camps. What became of the Italian Jewish community as the war proceeded?__EOS__ Well, actually, there were Italian concentration camps, although they were not extermination camps. But you're right, the racial laws had never envisioned the mass murder of the Jews of Italy. But in 1943, Mussolini is overthrown and Hitler sends German troops to flood through the Italian peninsula, take over all of central and northern Italy, take control of Rome. The allies are now trying to battle their way up from Sicily, from the south of the boot, up north.__EOS__ You write in the author's note that the common narrative is that the Roman Catholic Church fought heroically against Italian fascism, you know, and that the Catholic Action, these clubs or these groups that were supported by the church, had been on the forefront of finding fascism. And your book tells a very, very different story, and it strikes me how much of, you know, how much of this was actually publically known at the time, or at least written about, if, you know, in some Italian papers and in some foreign newspapers.__EOS__ Well, I think this is a fascinating question and it's part of a larger question - namely, Italy remaking its fascist past. So it's not just the Catholic Church. If you think of Italy right after the war, they had been fascists for 20 years. They had been allies of Hitler. Italian forces had fought alongside of Nazi forces in the eastern front in the Soviet Union and in Africa and elsewhere, the Balkans.",0
50224," Talking about your childhood, and it certainly wasn't too opulent; I'm wondering what kind of books you had access to growing up.__EOS__ Oh, well, I grew up on comic books, the other kids and I. And this was in Beaver, W.Va. You know, we collect pop - old pop bottles, so we'd take them to the store and get - build up our pennies. And then we'd go to the drugstore and buy comic books. And I was crazy about them.__EOS__ Now, I'm a boy, so I'm thinking, you know, ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" and ""Spider-Man."" Is that what you were reading?__EOS__ I was reading ""Archie,"" ""Baby Huey"" and ""Little Lulu,"" but mostly ""Archie.""",0

50226," I was always interested in trying to find how different genre would affect the lyrics that I've written. Salsa is where most of my songs have been recorded. And the genre of salsa is very frenetic, fast-paced, and I felt that the lyrics sometimes were being lost. I wanted to see how the lyrics would react under tango type of structure, which is more reflexive.__EOS__ Let's listen to ""Ella.""__EOS__ .__EOS__ So I hear what you're talking about.",2
50227," What are you going to do when this is all over? How long do you think you'll last? And George says, well, if we do as well as Cliff and the Shadows have done we won't be moaning. Now Cliff Richard and the Shadows had lasted up to this point, in the U.K., about five years - which was just seemed - just seemed a lifetime to everybody. And this question just keeps cropping up all the way through their career up to 1970. But nobody had any idea of how fast they would progress in every record they made would be a signal from the front to other groups  this is what you have to catch up to. They were so progressive. So it does put you back in the time.__EOS__ One more comment from that I want to add. Several of these listeners said it was, quote, ""mainly for the sake of the children who liked the beat groups."" But they themselves preferred the kind of music provided by Acker Bilk and Vince Hill, quote, ""an underrated artist who should be heard more often.""__EOS__ Yeah. More Vince Hill and less Beatles.__EOS__ I know. It's extraordinary to think, isn't it? And those audience research report comments continue all the way through their career. You know, in the 1969 chapter of the book, I talk about a program called ""24 Hours  The World of John and Yoko."" John and Yoko were followed around by BBC camera crew over several days, and then this documentary program was put together and broadcast December, 1969. And it is a very revealing portrait of John and Yoko, what they were doing at that time. There is an incredible interview transcribed in the book where John talks to Gloria Emerson, the London correspondent of The New York Times, who is not impressed by John and Yoko's peace campaign and what they're doing. And that's a remarkable interview to read. It's quite confrontational.",0

50229," …not just less active, but maybe perhaps not available to your children, I think you're kind of abandoning them kind of too early. I mean, the job of parenting continues on into early adulthood for many of us. My dad's 75, I'm 45, and he's still a tremendous benefit as a person to turn to for help and knowledge. __EOS__ Yeah. And there are also questions - they are unlikely any relations whatsoever with grandparents. And here's a question we got from - and thanks, Dan, very much. Here's an email question we got from Amy in Tulsa, Oklahoma. __EOS__ And just even babysitting for them. So we know that, yes, there's a trend that sometimes they're taking the kids into their homes and raising them. But I have a bunch of friends whose mothers are watching their kids for them. So somebody has the energy to do it. But it is - I do hear from grandparents all the time it's so nice to give them back at the end of the day. And when you're raising them, it is a different - and it's more of a survival thing at that point. I mean, you're just trying to keep the family intact. __EOS__ And also - Neal, this is Nancy. ",3
50230," You describe, just now, that moment of reality in the middle of the night so vividly, that I couldn't help but start wondering how you slept last night. __EOS__ I sleep fitfully. But I experience that moment. You know, I have moments of waking up in the middle of the night and questioning exactly what the purpose of life was. And it's, certainly, has always frightened me. __EOS__ So this character you write about, Anthony Hopkins, he runs away from his wife; he proposes marriage to a call girl, and then brings her to meet his adult daughter and son-in-law, played by Naomi Watts and Josh Brolin. Afterward, they talk about that meeting - and here they are. __EOS__  I found that whole public display completely disgusting. And did you see the ring he got her? I'm telling you, she'll take him for everything he's worth, and then leave him pouring his heart out to some bar man. ",1
50231," I've been a prosecutor since 1976 and I have to say that this is among, if not the most serious, it is within the top two or three most serious leaks that I've ever seen. It put the American people at risk, and that is not hyperbole. It put the American people at risk.__EOS__ Now, the attorney general has now recused himself from the investigation which has now gone forward because he says he's already been interviewed by the FBI. And I do want to also mention that a number of media outlets, including this one, NPR, has sent a letter of protest to the Justice Department, saying that this was overreaching. So Corey, I'm going to start with you because this is the administration in which you served. Do you think that the Department of Justice was wrong?__EOS__ Well, I'll tell you, this is the classic conversation, the classic battle, between the American people's right to know, which is the role of the press, the role of the media in our country, versus the government's responsibility to protect its citizens. And right now I think we're at the very beginning of this conversation and investigating what actually happened here and why it happened.__EOS__ So what are you saying? You're saying you haven't decided yet? You still don't know? You still don't know.",3
50232," I wonder if I could just follow up on the conversation briefly.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ It's also one of my favorite films - not just of yours but period. And for me what's interesting about it is there's this sense that there is no truth to be had in surveillance. There is no certainty. And I think that is something that endures because we're living in a more and more uncertain world, I think. When you were making the film when you were designing it was that something that was top of your mind?__EOS__ You know, what was top of my mind when I was making that film was I wanted to make the film as beautiful as ""Blow-Up."" You know, I had seen ""Blow-Up"" by Michelangelo Antonioni and I said boy, that's the kind of film I - those were the kind of films I want to make. I - something that's unique and it occupies its own kind of thing, and I made ""The Conversation."" I sat down to write that after being so enthusiastic about seeing ""Blow-Up."" And throughout my career, I have seen great films that have just filled me with pleasure and said, I want to make a film like that. And I think that's OK for young people to do, you know, because it's impossible. You set out to imitate something you thought was beautiful but in the end you can't. You're going to end up with what you have to say, you know?",1
50233," Forest Whitaker, any final thoughts from you? You know, I always want to ask this question, but people hate this question, which is what do you hope people will draw from the film? But I'm going to ask it.__EOS__ I'm hoping that people will understand, or look inside themselves, in posing the question of what are our responsibilities towards others? You know, there are so many, particularly African American males, incarcerated in prisons across the country, to such an astronomical degree that I think you would want to call it apartheid. You know, and I'm hoping that people will carry some of that with them. If it's possible there, then it's possible, of course, here. So that's what I hope will occur.__EOS__ Forest Whitaker is an academy award winning actor. He is a producer. He's the narrator and executive producer of ""Serving Life"" and he was with us from Burbank, California. Lisa Cohen is the director of the documentary, ""Serving Life."" She's a veteran journalist, an award winning journalist. She's currently teaching journalism at Columbia University and she was kind enough to join us from Atlantic City, where we caught up with her.__EOS__ Thank you.",1
50234," Well, I have a high tolerance for people in public life who commit affairs because I think they're morally uncomfortable or wrong in private life. But, I think people do compartmentalize. And they can perform a public role. And so, I'm always - my tendency is always to want to forgive. But then you draw another distinction and that's between the people who commit illicit, sleazy affairs where they don't actually care about the person, and the people who actually fall in love. And I - in one way the people who fall in love are less totally immoral than the sleazy ones. __EOS__ That was a remarkable press conference he did. And it went on and on and more soul bearing I think than we have seen from just about any politician. __EOS__ In some sense more soul bearing than you get from your best friend. I mean, it was really remarkable. I broadly sympathize with the theologian David Brooks, of what he - how he analyzed this. Although you look at Senator Ensign and Governor Sanford… __EOS__ Senator Ensign from Nevada. ",3
50235," Penelope Lively's lifetime habit of storytelling began when she was growing up in Egypt during World War II. She spent a lot of time alone and amused herself by making up stories, which often involved embellishing the classics with her own personal touch.__EOS__ The Libyan campaign in the desert was raging about 70 or 80 miles away, so I sort of re-jigged ""The Iliad"" and put Achilles in a tank instead of all that nonsense about chariots and spears and those kind of things.__EOS__ As the war got closer, Lively's family fled Egypt. They landed safely in what was then Palestine. But in a story from one of her earlier books, ""Making it Up,"" Lively re-imagines that event, tragically. In making it up, Lively uses real moments from her own life and fictionalizes them, an impulse that grew out of her own late-in-life musings.__EOS__ You find yourself looking back over your own life and wondering about where it could have gone completely different. And so this was what I was doing. I was looking at the kind of climactic points in my own life and seeing where they might have gone. So, I was writing in a sense a set of what didn't happen. I was writing the alternative lives that I didn't have.",0

And this album is called ""New Fever Waltz.""__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ ...that means. And what do you think of when you're singing it?__EOS__ This is probably my favorite song on the album. It's just so beautiful, and yet so harsh. The melody is so beautiful and the piano interlude and the orchestral interlude with the horns is so - it's moving. And it's just about pain and agony and, you know, desperation. And so while I'm singing it, it's this beautiful little melody and the lyrics are, as you say - whew. It's from a desperate time.",3
50237," So, you are now ambivalent about the Sunni awakening - similar tactics about to be tried in Afghanistan. General Petraeus is now the head of CENTCOM. So he's overseeing things, you know, from the top in Afghanistan. And the plan now is to put out some feelers to see if theres any possibility of negotiating with the Taliban. But at the same time, the goal is to kind of buy off - I think thats fair to say - low-level Taliban, like local Taliban fighters who might be willing to stop their affiliation with the Taliban in return for jobs and money. So, if you look at how the similar plan worked in Iraq and apply it to Afghanistan, what do you see? __EOS__ Its funny. Last week, I was in a two-day meeting on precisely this subject, about 25 U.S. military commanders, a couple of Iraqis, some other experts. It was all off-the-record, so I cant attribute directly what was said, but that was exactly the question we were addressing. And the conclusion was interesting. These commanders, some of whom have been directly involved in the Sunni awakening and the deals with sheikhs, and so on, again and again said these type of things are very localized. You cant do it top-down. You have to do it town by town, even neighborhood by neighborhood. You cant replicate in Afghanistan what we did in Anbar Province. __EOS__ This was the key thing to me. __EOS__ My guest is Tom Ricks. His bestseller, ""Fiasco,"" was about the invasion and occupation of Iraq. His follow-up book, ""The Gamble,"" has jut been published in paperback. More after a break. ",0
50238," You did find though that teen boys - I'm not drawing a causal connection here because clearly, 'cause what you're telling us is that there is no evidence to suggest it. But you said that teen boys take more risks when they think another teen boy is watching. And why is that? And is that different for girls?__EOS__ Well, the reason for it seems to be this very, you know, age-old stage of development that we have called adolescence that we, you know, we need to eventually leave our homes and go find our own path and it's not going to help us much if all we want to do is stay home with our parents. And so, you know, we have these inherent biological wedges, we call them, that help, you know, separate us from our parents and get out there and explore. Teen boys do have a tendency to take risks in general more than females, but particularly when the there are other boys around.__EOS__ And does the same apply to girls in the research?__EOS__ The research hasn't been done with girls yet. But there are very large differences between how males and females socialize. For instance, even looking, you know, back to social media, female will text message - about 60 percent of females say they text message their friends throughout the day just to say hi. It's about 40 percent for males. This is very different creatures in terms of how they socialize. So I think the risk-taking that females tend to engage in is a little different. It's more social risk. It's, you know, closer to the vest that the things that men do. Young males will just do things in the world that are very obvious. Whereas, females I think take - tend to take more subtle risks.",3

50244," Even though the focus is on the volunteers themselves, there's plenty of hope and admiration expressed in these letters for the people with whom they worked and admiration for their courage and bravery.__EOS__ That's Julian Bond, one of the founders of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee of SNCC, and now chairman of the NAACP.__EOS__ The whole thrust of the movement, you know, as often characterized as what Martin Luther King did and without taking anything away from him, had it not been for the people in this book, we wouldn't think of Dr. King in the same kind of way.__EOS__ The idea for republishing ""Letters from Mississippi"" came from former volunteer Jim Kates, who is now co-director of a small independent publishing company, Zephyr Press, and Elizabeth Martinez, the original editor of the book. They asked Julian Bond to write an introduction giving the history of SNCC and the summer project.",0
50245," The band is Moon Hooch. They started out busking on subway platforms in Brooklyn and attracting crowds with their weirdly irresistible jazzy, funky, klezmery jams. Actually, they were trying to replicate some of the sounds they heard in dance clubs, making acoustic versions of electronic dance music - hence cave music.__EOS__ It's like house music, but it's more jagged, wild, more free and more natural to live in.__EOS__ That's James Muschler, the drummer for Moon Hooch. Along with reed players Mike Wilbur and Wenzl McGowen, they've found a way to produce the most extreme sounds of electronic dance music, using instruments you can find in a big orchestra, like on this song, ""Contra Dubstep.""__EOS__ The most notably dubstep element of that song is Wenzl's contrabass clarinet, which is the lowest clarinet of the clarinet family. And it gets all the way down to the low C on the piano. And with this instrument, with a contact mic on the reed going through the subwoofer, it really emulates the sound of dubstep music. It gets that, like, .",2
50246," Well, I think it's a moral crisis and I think what's happening is the awakening of a conscious in this country because people are seen images of children, these are children who are in harm's way, they're being in many cases crammed into detention facilities. This is a humanitarian crisis, it's a moral crisis. It ought to invoke a conscious that says, this is not the way that things ought to be. At the same time I find that some of the responses that are coming back would love to see an easy quick fix. And so there are many people in congregations for instance, when they see these images on television would say, well let's just send some mission trips there and fix this crisis and in reality until the government comes in and fixes an incoherent policy and also deals with the root problem of people who are fleeing from a drug war going on in Central America, we're not going to be able to get a fix on this.__EOS__ Are - do you have - does the commission have some guidance for individual congregations at this point about how they should respond or what they should do?__EOS__ Well, there's a limit on what individual congregations can do because congregations can't simply show up at the border and start dealing with the refugees that are there because they're in - they're in government holding patterns waiting for a hearings to determine what the refugee status of the children would be. There are groups and Christians and churches who are ministering as best they can but until the government comes in and takes responsibility for the government's own failed policies here, there's a limit on what we can do. What I've been seeking to do is to speak to our people, to the people of Christ and to say we need to make sure that we understand that the response to this cannot be what it is in some sectors of American society, which is fear and loathing against immigrants and against refugees. We need to recognize that we have a moral responsibility to love neighbor and Jesus tells us the story of a man who passes by someone who is beaten on the road, a Samaritan and he cares for that man. We ought to listen to that message and recognize that our response to this crisis can't be as simple and easy fix but it also can't be, to say who is my neighbor in Spanish.__EOS__ If you're just joining us we're talking about how faith communities are responding to this increase in - huge increase in undocumented children who are crossing the border. I'm speaking with Russell Moore, the President of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Public Policy Commission and Pastor Rudy Rasmus of St. John's Downtown in Houston. Those are both prominent faith leaders involved in issues of public concern. So, you know, to that end you were talking about this whole question of fear and anxiety that this is provoking on the part of some people. I just want to - the video of one Houston resident, a woman named Bernadette Lancelin went viral last week. She was responding to the Department of Homeland Security officials who were touring an old middle school to see if it could house unaccompanied children and here she is speaking to the Fox station KRIV.",3

50248," Good afternoon. __EOS__ Whose idea was ""Tomorrow's Children""? __EOS__ I think that when the kids sounded so good, a lot of people said other people will want to listen to them. And so all of a sudden, a record started to be made. I would say it was also possible because a wonderful drummer in our hometown has a studio right next to his  in his home. __EOS__ Sorry to miss him, too. But who pulled the Rivertown Kids together as a group? ",2
50249," I thought yeah. And I could do my Ray Charles and my Muddy Waters, Otis Spann influences, and I could do just all kinds of bluesy, funky stuff behind what Jim was singing. And then he had a couple of other songs, ""My Eyes Have Seen You,"" and ""Summer's Almost Gone,"" and they were just, they had beautiful melodies to them that would just allow for chord changes and improvisations, and I said, man, this is incredible, let's get a rock and roll band together.__EOS__ What do we call the band? It's got no name. We can't call it Morrison and Manzarek, I mean, you know, M&M or, you know, Two Guys from Venice Beach or something. He said no, man, we're going to call it The Doors.__EOS__ And the light bulb went on, and I said that's it, the Doors of Perception. He said no, no, just The Doors. I said like Aldous Huxley. He said yeah, but we're just The Doors.__EOS__ And that was it. We were The Doors.",3

In 2009, they became one of the surprise hits of the year. The music magazine Paste named their record ""I and Love and You"" the best of that year, calling it an overpowering acoustic album brimming with sadness and soul.__EOS__  My dream of all dreams and my hope of all hopes is only to tell you and make sure you know how much I love you and how much I always did.__EOS__ I recently spoke with Scott, Seth and Bob about the difficult period since their last album. And first, I asked Bob about Hallie's condition.",2

50253," ...three, two, three, eight...__EOS__ Daniel Tammet writes about that experience in a collection of essays called ""Thinking in Numbers."" He joined us from Paris, where he lives, and I began by asking him to explain exactly what it is he sees when he's thinking in numbers.__EOS__ Every number has its own color, so the number one is like a shining light from a lantern. The number two is more like a flowing, darker, purple color. Three is green, and after 10 the individual digits contribute their own color, so I am seeing a blend of those primary colors. And when I recited the number pi, I would see the colors as a landscape full of textures and emotions, and I would blend together into a kind of story or poem that I could recite to those who were listening to me.__EOS__ You write in the essay in this book about a moment during your recitation of pi when you faltered. What happened at that point? Can you describe what was going through your mind to get you back on track to conjure up that next digit?",0
50254," To be a pimp?__EOS__ When he first goes to prison for car theft, he thinks this is a great opportunity to study at the feet of some of the great pimps, who for whatever reason or another, find themselves in prison with Charlie. And they teach him about separating women from their families and loved ones, beating them enough to scare them but being loving enough to make them feel valued, cut them off from every type of communication except your own.__EOS__ And he knew how to find vulnerable women. Like when he got - after his years in reform school and then prison, when he gets out, he goes to the Haight-Ashbury, and he basically looks for teenage runaways who were already in a very lost and vulnerable position.__EOS__ And this is what I mean again by how the threads of history come together to make something possible. Charlie Manson is paroled from prison in California. Now, if he's in Nebraska, let's say, and he gets out of prison, and he goes to live in Omaha, if he tried to pull this shtick with the daughters of the farmers of Nebraska they'd have stuck him on a pitchfork and left him in a field as a scarecrow.",3

50257," There isn't - certainly to my knowledge - a jazz musician who doesn't pay honor and tribute to Duke Ellington. The way he put his orchestrations together, that was all completely new. And having Hodges and the rest of these wonderful soloists in his orchestras provided an opportunity for people that were on their own soloists to play together in the big band, and my goodness, what a noise they made.__EOS__ It's crazy good.__EOS__ I was struck by something that you said in your book - and I hope I'm getting this right - singing for me is actually life itself. It's communication person to person and soul to soul, a physical, emotional, spiritual and intellectual expression carried by the breath.__EOS__ Yes, I do believe that. We can all sing and we should all try because it is a wonderful thing for the body to be filled with all of that oxygen that you've got to take into your body in order to have it come out again as sound. It makes you feel good, and it makes the person listening to you feel good as well.",2
50258," Violinist David Harrington dreamed up the idea of a string quartet devoted primarily to contemporary music in 1973. Since then, he and his fellow musicians have commissioned and premiered new works by some of the most important composers of our time, including John Adams, Steve Reich and Phillip Glass.__EOS__ Every time we bring a new work, a new composition into our rehearsal and then ultimately into a performance, it's a little bit like climbing a new mountain. You know, the challenges are there, you know, can we play it in tune. Can we play it together? Can we get the music out of the piece?__EOS__ They've developed very deep ties with composers they've known for almost half a century. Violist Hank Dutt, who's been with Kronos since 1977.__EOS__ The great thing about our work is that we've always work with a composer. And we've played many composers' works. So there's a relationship going on. And a lot of times, those composers recognize the strengths of each of us individually and can write for that, which is terrific.",2
50259," Oh my gosh, Terry. We have a rack, we literally have a costume rack with maybe 50 princess dresses. But our princesses, you know, they shoot arrows, and they do math. And I was always like we can be like Snow White, the doctor to the African orphans.__EOS__ That's funny, you know, because obviously you don't want your daughters to adopt the traditional princess stories too deeply, but here you are writing all these songs about princesses, and you cast your children in the movie, and one of them plays one of the princesses when she's a young child, which she does the voice.__EOS__ I hope not. I mean, who doesn't send their daughters mixed messages in this world?__EOS__ You do your best not to send them mixed messages, but every time you look in the mirror and say oh, I've got to put on Spanx under this dress, you're sending a mixed message. That said, I think that there are things about the princess tradition that we can celebrate in terms of a female being the main character of a story, which is in itself very subversive in this day and age in Hollywood.",2
50260," Yeah.__EOS__ ...punk and even some kind of '90s alternative music. Is that the route, you know, Ramones to Ronettes?__EOS__ Kind of. I mean, when I first started writing the songs, I didn't really have a very, like, strategic plan. I just sort of was, like, okay, I wanted to  A, have a name that represents California or represents West Coast, and I think I chose probably the best name that I could.__EOS__ Well, then, we definitely have to hear a song because that's a big...",2
50261," Yes. __EOS__ Did you attend? __EOS__ Unfortunately, I couldn't. I did send my money in to go, but the governor was having a reception at the same time, and we were committed to that reception on that day and time. So unfortunately, I couldn't go. But I had really planned to go and take my husband. __EOS__ Well, I did go. We all made a pact that if one would go, we would all go. And we all attended this past June. ",0
50262," What were you thinking when I was born? __EOS__ I guess as a 16-year-old who came from a situation where there wasn't a father, you know, my confidence level was probably as low as it possibly could get because I realized that I was going to be responsible for some person. So, I was scared. __EOS__ Since you're younger, it's easy for me to, like, speak to you. And we'll be on kind of the same level. __EOS__ Yeah. Is there anything you always wanted to tell me but haven't? ",3

It's kind of a blend of a couple of different things...__EOS__ Well, that sounds about right. Are these all friends of yours?__EOS__ Yeah, all friends or friends of friends. And yeah, I try to have some kind of relationship with the people that I paint, because when I'm working on them, you know, for an expended period of time, it's nice to have a connection with that person, I think, and that comes across in the work, I hope.__EOS__ To that point, though, are people surprised when they look at this work, which has a very - let me just put it this way - there's no ethnic ambiguity here. The subjects you've chosen, they have a very clear, you know, kind of strong African-American cultural look. Their clothing is very contemporary. What's the word?

50269," I think we just feel so lucky, grateful to have got where we have got. And I almost feel like it would be ungrateful to be like, well, we want to be playing arenas, we want to sell a million records, because it doesn't help with the state of the industry at the moment. You know, it's impossible to know whether, you know, in six months' time or a year's time, we could be back in our day jobs. So I think that's kind of our attitude at the moment  enjoy things how they are. And that's kind of all that matters at the present.__EOS__ Well, Peter Liddle, thanks a lot for coming in.

And it was something that we really had to - my sisters and I really had to fight to do, to play sports, to be involved in any kind of after school activities. They didn't quite understand that - even things like the prom. I remember having to explain to my mother what the prom was, and it just sounded to her like a really bad idea.

What did you do to prepare? __EOS__  We had to learn some accelerated versions of scuba-diving      using a rebreather, which is another form of scuba-diving, and I had to      do some rock climbing, and we had to learn about caves. __EOS__  And that's no joke down there. __EOS__  No, it's no joke.  It's very dangerous, very dangerous,      because when you're exploring these caves, you're going through very      cramped and confined spaces.  Sometimes you even have to take off your      scuba equipment and your rebreather, slip it through the space, and then      come through after it. Sometimes you get stuck and, you know, sometimes      people really don't make it out.  And you're literally, you know,      hundreds of feet beneath the surface. ",3
50290," His finances were always kind of a closely guarded secret. We do know that he was millions of dollars in debt; that the great Beatles catalog, which he owned, which had produced a great deal of income, was in danger. He might have lost it. But he kept being bailed out by various hedge funds and advisers. And what was going to really salvage his empire was this tour, this ""This Is It"" tour. It was going to produce a huge amount of money. __EOS__ And I understand that just in the past few days the value of his estate has already gone up; Amazon has sold out of many of his recordings, for example. __EOS__ Right. It's been a boom; a bonanza of sales of Michael Jackson records, of Michael Jackson memorabilia, anything people can get their hands on. Now there's a hint today that there may be a film of some kind which would be based on the videotapes of the rehearsals for the ""This Is It"" concert. It's like people look back and they say that Elvis was a richer man in death than he was in life, and Michael Jackson may be the same story. __EOS__ Michael Jackson, of course, had three children; one of them with a surrogate mother. What happens to those kids? ",2
50291," All the time. Almost every day of my life. I really mean that too - all the time.__EOS__ I wonder about your extraordinarily long career. I mean, it's not easy. I say this even though all I do is talk. It's not easy to preserve your voice, to sound like people expect and want you to sound over a long period of time. And you've done it for decades. How do you do that?__EOS__ Well, Linda, you know what I do? I tell young singers this all the time, too, 'cause they think the remedy is, like, hot tea and lemon and all this other - I take care of myself because your vocal cords and your vocal ability and all this stuff is a part of you. And if you take care of your entire self, than that's going to fall in line with that. I used to run marathons. I don't run like that anymore. I'll run a couple miles or so now. I've been doing yoga for about the past 35 years, and it's been one of the greatest things that's ever happened for me in my life for my body.__EOS__ Do you think that's what's kept all those songs arriving every day?",2
50292,"  She was nobody here. It was not just that she had no friends and family. It was rather that she was a ghost in this room, in the streets on the way to work, on the shop floor. Nothing meant anything. The rooms in the house in Ireland belonged to her, she thought. When she moved in them she was really there.__EOS__ Did you ever experience the kind of loneliness and dislocation that you've described in the paragraph from ""Brooklyn"" that you just read?__EOS__ Yeah, I did but, I mean, I wouldn't like to dwell on it. In other words, I didn't have that experience that so many Irish immigrants had of going on their own, having menial jobs and working as servants or builders, or having those jobs in England and in America.__EOS__ No, you drive on the wrong side of the road there.",0
50293,"  Come on, baby, come on down. I'm goin' fishin', yes I'm goin' fishin', and you can come fishin' too. __EOS__ Laurel Masse, I want to talk about the song that you recorded with Killian on the album, Irving Berlin's ""Blue Skies."" __EOS__  Blue skies smiling at me, nothing but blue skies do I see. __EOS__ And of course, that's Killian's ukulele in the background. Laurel Masse, what do you remember about the recording sessions with Killian? ",2
50294," Yeah, that's true. I have great friends that I grow old with, that know everything about me, that I'm intimate with, intellectually and everything. But if I'm going to go to the trouble of living with somebody, sharing my life with them, I want great sex. I don't understand not doing that. I understand both things, but to me, they're separate - that I have friends that supply all that, and if I'm going to have a partner, I want to have great sex with them. __EOS__ But... __EOS__ I feel crowded. __EOS__ So you've stayed single.

50295," Well, you know, there's a reason that I called my book about the rebuilding of ground zero. Originally the subtitle was going to ""Architecture, Politics and the Rebuilding of New York."" And the only change the editors made was to say, I think we should reverse the wording in the subtitle and call it ""Politics, Architecture and the Rebuilding of New York,"" because it's mostly a story of politics. Sadly, nine years later, that's still the case. __EOS__ Well, Paul Goldberger, thank you so much for talking with us about it. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ Paul Goldberger of The New Yorker. He is also the author of, ""Up From Zero  Politics, Architecture and the Rebuilding of New York.""  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",3
50296," writing a book, or performing in a long-running stage play, or mapping the genome. __EOS__ Yes, it's work in progress. And the more you study these pieces, the more frequently you perform them, the deeper you get under the skin of the composer and start to look like Beethoven. Luckily, I'm not deaf yet. __EOS__ Andras Schiff was born in Budapest 55 years ago. He has now completed recording the 32 Beethoven piano sonatas. He has been studying them, lecturing about them, and playing them in concert halls. And when he was in Los Angeles recently to do just that, he took some time to sit down at the piano and talk with us about Beethoven and those 32 sonatas, which Beethoven wrote over the course of 25 years, starting when he was still in his 20s. __EOS__ He came to Vienna in the early 1790s from Germany, where he was born, and these early piano sonatas are like his visiting cards. He composed them and played it himself, and this is how he found his way into Viennese society. ",2
50297," What about Selena's other point, though, that young men tend to be opportunists, if you will - which may be largely true - and therefore, if the opportunity presents itself, they're not interested in dating. They might be interested in hooking up. __EOS__ Well, that's also true, and another quick story there. I was out with some girls and guys at a bar, and this guy had probably had one too many beers, so he started spilling his guts. And he said, you know, the hookup culture just allows men to be jerks, and he didn't use the word jerk, but that's the word I'll use on the air. __EOS__ That is exactly my sentiment. __EOS__ Yeah, yeah. No, it gives guys - and this is what young women need to understand, and we need to understand better. This gives young women license to do - I mean, young men license to do what they've wanted to do all along. Now this is going to sound anti-male, and I'm not. I have a 22-year-old son, and I hope and believe that he doesn't treat women this way. But I do think there is - guys are caught - guys are sort of penalized by their guy-ness. I mean, they have to kind of think that they're the player. ",0
50298," No. NASCAR will not say, and that is part of the problem, I think, with its policy. NASCAR hasn't even given drivers a list of banned substances. It says that that permits it greater leeway in testing. __EOS__ Well, some notable differences between NASCAR and many other sports is there's no league, and there's no players' union. __EOS__ No. NASCAR is a corporation, and each racing team is a private company. There have been attempts in the past by drivers to unionize, back in the 1960s mostly, but those were crushed by NASCAR's leader, Bill France. The difference today, of course, is that NASCAR has become a lucrative sport. The drivers and car owners profit handsomely, and NASCAR has been responsive to drivers' needs and requests, but it does get more complicated when it comes to issues like drug testing and you see that in the Mayfield case. __EOS__ Now, NASCAR moves on to Charlotte this weekend, and the other brand of racing, open-wheeled Indy cars, is also in the news. The final round of qualifying for this year's Indianapolis 500 is scheduled for tomorrow. ",3
50299," Sure.__EOS__ ...to talk about how you think that experience changed you as an artist?__EOS__ For me, once I was diagnosed - once I was handed that diagnosis, it was very apparent to me that my life was never going to look or feel the same to me again. And that - my lesson was, in my diagnosis and laying on the radiation table every single morning for seven weeks, was nobody can take care of me but me. And I wasn't doing that. I was putting everybody's needs before me. And so it was really - you know, I met myself on that radiation table every day. And I had to reflect and had to remember who it was I came in as and had to really sort of redefine my life.__EOS__ Well, let me apologize on behalf of my colleagues for your - I mean -  - the collective apology on behalf of my colleagues.",2
50300," Sort of...__EOS__ Well, that's...__EOS__ You know, I mean the military, the Army is very focused on the correct and most efficient way to respond to a dangerous and chaotic situation. So to say that you're a catastrophist almost makes it sound dramatic.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.",0
50301," Who knew, in the auditorium or arena or wherever you were, who knew what you were doing? __EOS__ There was one guy who knew, the guy who promoted the cage match. __EOS__ The audience was completely unprepared. We had our own security people who were sort of interspersed, and they were obviously conscious, and our crew was conscious, but the audience themselves were completely unprepared. __EOS__ Did the security people do anything that was effective?

50302," ""Underneath,"" that's off the new album by Alanis Morissette called ""Flavors of Entanglement."" Much, Alanis, has already been written about this new album, and the story behind the album. And before I attempt to frame that or repackage what other people have said, I want to give you a chance to do that. How do you articulate the story of this album? __EOS__ Well, there's two main themes. One of them is the unraveling of my internal personal world, hitting rock bottom. __EOS__ Oh, just that. __EOS__ Oh, just that, that little detail. ",2
50303," It's a provocative moms' conversation and we'll have it next time on TELL ME MORE.__EOS__ I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. We are continuing our conversation with Wyclef Jean about his new memoir, ""Purpose  An Immigrant's Story."" You might remember that, along with Pras Michel and Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean created the band, The Fugees. Fans made their blockbuster album, ""The Score,"" the best-selling hip-hop album up to that point and critics swooned over their then remarkable blend of rap and multicultural musicianship.__EOS__  Ready or not, here I come. You can't hide. I'm going to find you and make you want me. Yeah. Now that I escape, sleepwalk awake, those who could relate know the ain't cake. Jail bars ain't golden gates. Those who fake, they break when they meet their 400-pound mate. If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun...__EOS__ I asked Wyclef Jean why he thought people around the world connected to that album.",2
50304,"  Rae, I want to get your take on this. You were tested positive at the age of 23.  You've dedicated your life since then to educating young people about HIV/AIDS, and when you hear Marvelyn's story, how does it make you feel? __EOS__  You know, she's classic, and what I see and continue to see across this country is that there's been a disconnect on one's personal life with HIV.  The earlier images of HIV really impacted America.  We still by and large believe it's white, we believe it's male, we believe it's gay, we believe it's other, we believe it's, you know, women who are promiscuous, and we think it's not me and so I see her story as pretty much consistent.  __EOS__  But Rae, talk to me, though, about - I mean, there are all these groups that you hear about like Balm In Gilead, you hear of churches having outreach, you hear of HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, you have celebrities who've been very involved in raising awareness.  And I guess I think about you, I think of the fact that you have been on television, you've been on the covers of magazines, you've given speeches all over the country or in schools. I don't know how - what, you're in a school like every week? __EOS__  Yes. ",0
50305," Well, I think it's going to be a wonderful thing for the Haitian people, because the Association for Cultural Equity, they had ongoing repatriation project to make these available in Haiti. And Kimberly Green, of The Green Foundation, have said that preservation to support cultural identity is an integral part of poverty mitigation.__EOS__ Really? Why?__EOS__ Well, because when people hear and they know their own past, it often is very empowering. Alan certainly found this when he recorded people. He would play it back to them. They would be delighted.__EOS__ Do you think that, perhaps, there are, say, children growing up in Haiti who would have never had heard, maybe, the music of their forbearers.",2
50306," and putting the sock on the door and all that. __EOS__ We're busy, do not disturb. Well what then that's the best kind of stuff like I wanted, I guess. __EOS__ Well what's next for you? You've already done so many things, made seven albums… __EOS__ I don't know. ",2
50307," Well, they have to find some salvage. There must be one of - we're in the sweet 16 now, so you know, my bracket - yes - I lost a few, but I still have nine teams, you know, in the sweet 16.

50308," Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, you got to move, baby. You gots to move. You got to give the ladies what they want.__EOS__ What would you wear?__EOS__ I would wear a pair of jeans, and I would wear my brother Peter's jersey, which had a zero on the back.__EOS__ So it wasn't really tight leather pants?",2
50309," They tend to shoot at a patrol, into a cluster of people who are walking or a bunch of people who are standing around, you know, at a checkpoint or the like. And in this sense, they sort of shoot often offhand, without the sites up to the eyes. And they fire a burst towards the group. Now, the weapon tends to have its barrel rise upward as more bullets leave in a burst. So as it climbs, the elevation of the bullets leaving it climb, and they tend to fire over your head a lot. __EOS__ Does that give you any confidence when you're fired on? __EOS__ Confidence probably isn't the right word. I mean, but it  it still scares you very much, and you react to it. And, you know, you get down, or you get behind something. __EOS__ It gets used in other places like... ",0
50310," So if it is true, that observation that you just made, that actors more readily tap into their emotions and that those emotions are always kind of gushing and...__EOS__ Absolutely.__EOS__ ...that's responsible for some of the problems they often have in life.__EOS__ Oh yeah. And I think...",3
50311," Yes.__EOS__ Why was he assassinated?__EOS__ Well, he was a Shia and he was assassinated for being a Shia. His 12-year-old son was shot in the head and killed. I mean, this stuff goes on. There are attacks on Christians. There are attacks on Hindus. There are attacks on Ahmadis. There are attacks on Shias. And there are attacks on Sunnis, well, the majority not necessarily for being Sunnis but for other reasons; political beliefs or being in the police or being in the wrong place at the wrong time. So this violence, you know, is ongoing.__EOS__ You wrote an op-ed piece about a blast - a terrorist blast - that your sister felt in her office at the university where she teaches in Lahore. What was that explosion?",0

They're curious about where the stuff comes from. __EOS__  No. This is different. People who we've bought stuff from are sending in friends or lawyers to find out how much we're selling these things for. __EOS__  Hon, your guilt is warping you. ",1
50315," Right. So it must be true. So - but that idea is actually of relatively recent vintage - that stereotype about women's morality. That actually comes from the late 19th century. The stereotype about women in the 1600s and 1700s was just the opposite. It held that we were naturally lustful and wanton. We are in need of male guidance both in the form of, say, a father or of a husband in order to protect ourselves from our natural inclination and temptation into sin.__EOS__ You chronicle the stories of several different women and different trials. In looking at these primary texts, did you start to see a pattern emerge about the kind of women that was always accused?__EOS__ Definitely. Typical the woman who was accused as a witch was a woman at middle-age. And middle-aged for them was the same as for us, incidentally, so 40s to 60s. But they also were marginal in some capacity. Perhaps they did not have children, which was very unusual at that time. Perhaps they had had an unfortunate marriage. One of the women in ""The Penguin Book Of Witches"" had a husband who absconded with her money and left her destitute. Or perhaps you were a woman who expressed anger in a time when that was not widely looked upon.__EOS__ Why is there such an appetite for a book like this today? What is it about the supernatural, and the idea of witches in particular - women and witchcraft - that so preoccupies us today?",0
50316," I'm curious to ask you about this because when I listen to this I feel like your voice is her sounding very similar to each other and I wonder as you've gotten to know each other for the years, whether you think your voices have changed and have come closer together.__EOS__ I think that it's a lot like a married couple that ends up looking alike, even though we looked like before we got married.__EOS__ I think nothing actually changes, really, but it's just perceived differently. But I think we may make room for each other a little more or maybe we have, I guess, now that I'm thinking about it. But it's always felt right, like it's always just felt just close enough to where it seem like it worked.__EOS__ Do you hear a similarity in it?",2
50317," Jim Parsons, welcome to FRESH AIR. __EOS__ Thank you for having me. __EOS__ First of all, congratulations on your recent Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. __EOS__ Oh, thank you. ",3
50318," And does he have exit polls to back up his view that this isn't the result that should have emerged? __EOS__ His campaign conducted exit polls, and he says they found that the result on Election Day was that Pakhomov got about 46 percent, and that he, Nemtsov, got about 35 percent. And if that were true, if Pakhomov really did get less than 50 percent, then there should have been a runoff between him and Nemtsov. __EOS__ Now, I've seen some comments attributed to an independent observer group that looks at Russian elections. Are they a credible group and what do they say? __EOS__ Yeah, Golos, it's a very credible group. It studied thousands of elections in Russia. They say that they can't comment on whether people were definitely pressured to vote for Pakhomov when they voted ahead of Election Day. But they said that the number of people voting early, which was about 25 percent of the total number voting, is extremely high. And that this early voting is subject to more influence by state officials than Election Day voting because most of the people who are doing the early voting are state employees, such as teachers, soldiers, hospital workers.

50319," I think you're going to see them again. They're really exceptional. __EOS__ And if you want to see their video, you go to our website at sciencefriday.com. It's up there in the little box on the left. And it's actually our Video Pick of the Week, and is Flora's video pick. She actually picked it. __EOS__ I picked this one. __EOS__ Picked this one.

How did Denzel Washington prepare for that role? Or how did you help him?__EOS__ Well, you know, Denzel has - he's very, very focused and he's very prepared, and the only thing that we spoke about as far as levels of intoxication were, you know, he kind of had his own guide of what he was going to do, and he never really was specific, you know, with me about it.__EOS__ But he would come to me and say, you know, I watched this one where this guy was trying to put his shoe on and he was working on this for like, you know, 10 minutes to get this shoe on. He was out there on the street, and he couldn't get his foot in his shoe. And so he was - you know, he was looking at the physicality of what it is he was going to do.",1
50322," Yes, it's the type of thing you love to do something like that, to turn from comedy to tragedy. And it's also like life. I mean, that's why life happens, if suddenly something can make five seconds before irrelevant. All of a sudden, you're in the here now of what, you know, what just happened, the news that you've just gotten. So I wanted it to feel like that. As a matter of fact, rather than rehearsing anything like that, we just talked about it, how we wanted it to feel. And I told the story about hearing my mother scream, and she kept screaming. And as a little child, what that felt like. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. Yeah. When I showed the film to my family, you know, my parents and my aunts, my uncles. As they were looking at the years go by, they said their shoulders were going up and they were just waiting because they're like, it's about to happen, you know. And they say, we're going to have to dredge all that up again and I'm going to have to feel all that again. And it was very raw for them and very present for them even, you know, 40 years later. It was like right there. __EOS__ Don Cheadle and Kasi Lemmons. Thanks so much for coming in and talk to us. __EOS__ Thank you. ",3
50323," Yeah. __EOS__ The bartender said you should not mix rye and triple sec. __EOS__ I did have a headache the next day. There was that little issue but... __EOS__ I can see, the way you're looking, you had a little bit of an issue, too. ",0
50324," So you would say, this is what has been done in terms of musicians like  or composers like Mozart or Beethoven, like that? __EOS__ Oh yes, and also performers who did things like Paganini and so forth. Look at this guy, who was a little kid, who became one of the greatest violinists in the history of . Can't you do that yourself? You can. __EOS__ And did you also perform with them? __EOS__ Oh, yeah, I'm a jazz trombone player from age eight on, and I'm 75 now, so, you know... ",2
50325," You know, I haven't. I read the first ""Left Behind"" book, but I didn't spend a lot of time, you know, researching that firsthand. I had done a lot of research into contemporary Christian life for my last book, and this book was, in a way, more idea-driven.__EOS__ There's a character in your book who is a charismatic religious leader who, in the face of this sudden disappearance, creates a cult around him. Would you describe him a little bit?__EOS__ Yeah, this guy's name is - at first he's Mr. Gilchrest. He's a father who has lost his eight-year-old son and has discovered that he has a certain kind of gift, which is to comfort people by hugging them.__EOS__ The world's going to end, so let's have a good time now.",0
50326," Yeah, we had - a lot of them was going that night, so, but -yeah, it was very interesting. __EOS__ Well, in the end it all worked out for you. They said, Mr. Douthwaie, go ahead and put on your crazy hats again. __EOS__ They voted five-nothing to do it. And I think a lot of the community showed how much they appreciated that because yesterday morning, when I started wearing hats again, loads of people were beeping and saying congratulations, and it's nice to see the hats back and a bunch of other things. __EOS__ How many hats do you have?

50327," Yes.__EOS__ Where 241 Marines were killed. What did you learn about the attack that you don't think was public before?__EOS__ Well, what's interesting about the attack is, one is, it depends on how one looks at the - at both sides of this issue.

That's what--he calls them geniuses in his      manuscript. He singles out David Edwards, Honeyboy Edwards, who's still      alive, Muddy Waters and Sun House and Willie Brown with that guitar part      for his ""Mississippi Blues"" that reminded Professor Work of a big band      arrangement by a white band leader. __EOS__  John Works' manuscript is more than just a study of music.  It's      really a snapshot of what was going on in Coahoma County at the time.

50333," You came out because you were going to write the book. __EOS__ Yes. I was approached by someone who was starting a publishing arm of their business. And they said, I think that you have a book in you. I said no for a long time, Michel. And then I said, you know, I'm telling myself what people tell me when they're not interested in me, when they want to get rid of me, when what's important to me is not on their radar or they don't understand and they just say no. __EOS__ Yes. In fact, there have been a number of people who have been moved to tell their stories in the wake of that tragedy. This young man who was a student at Rutgers and - roommates, apparently, his classmates of his secretly streamed video of him having a sexual encounter with another student. Apparently, he was so humiliated by this that he chose to end his life. And others have said, you know what? Enough of that. So what has been the reaction? __EOS__ The reaction from me, quite frankly, has been overwhelmingly positive. The criticism that I have gotten has been expected, and in a way proves the reason that what I said and what I wrote was so important, and what I've said after. ",0
50334," You know, it's news to all of us. The studies of the brain in the last dozen years or so are revealing that the changing in the structure of the brain, which is basically getting the child ready to leave the nest and go out into the world, are actually changes that happen early on. So sometimes, they're even before the teenage years begin, and they last into the mid-20s, which kind of shocked everyone. And so what we now know is that this remodeling period is something that's really not about immaturity, but it's actually about transformation and ways that we can actually support in a positive way.__EOS__ Leslie, is this making sense to you?__EOS__ Oh, boy. I mean, this is just - it makes so much sense to me. The thing from a parent's perspective, though, that I find interesting is that I love parenting teenagers even though most of my friends think it's something to be survived. And it's tough. I call it the get-out-of-my-room-now-tuck-me-in phase. But I loved being a teenager.__EOS__ Aracely, you know, what about you? I mean, I know that you had - your daughter had some challenges. I mean, all the kinds of things that we talk about a lot, kind of the impulsivity. Those were things that you were really, you know, worried about. You want to talk a little bit about it?",3
50335," No, I don't think that I would resist that characterization, but again I think it's important to acknowledge that the point of view that is presented is one of this is a legal situation, and this is something that women have a right to and should have access to.

And the book was given to me by my mother when I was reaching my early tweens and embarking on adolescence. And while I did have Internet access and access to information within popular culture, it was really valuable to be able to have a book with a trusted friend voice like ""Our Bodies, Ourselves"" provides. __EOS__ And it made me curious about that book. So it actually made me think that my mom was much cooler that she presented me with this book and made me more interested in learning about myself.  seen it on TV. ",0

All my scholarly work so far - I include memoirs - is generally in English, but somewhere, they are going to meet together. Yeah.__EOS__ Do you mind talking a little bit more about that, why you made that decision and you stick to it?__EOS__ An interpreter has to know the languages of the people he's interpreting for or to whom he is interpreting. One of the greatest tragedies, I believe, of Africa is a complete disconnection of the elite from their linguistic base. In their reality, because of language, what happens is the messenger who is sent by the community to go and fetch knowledge from wherever they can get it becomes a prisoner. He never returns, so to speak, metaphorically, because he stays within the language of his captivity. In the case of African elite, generally, on the continent, is English and French. Monolingualism suffocates. Language contact is the oxygen of civilization.__EOS__ After all those years in exile, did you feel that you were able to be heard by the people who you wanted to hear you?",0

And the reason they did is that a number of German citizens - part of the reason, a number of German citizens have been traveling to the tribal regions of Pakistan to get training from al-Qaida and its affiliates there and have been coming back into Europe to plan a Mumbai-style assault. The main target of which was probably Germany, and that's why Germany is on alert. So, yeah, this is not, you know, this conflict hasn't passed into history.

50366," And you mentioned that some of these companies that the slaves work for were actually the precursor to some of the Fortune 5,000 companies that we're familiar with now. __EOS__ That's right, the - and I'm glad you brought that up because I hope that one of the things that readers will take away from this book is that this isn't just a sort of arcane history about things that happened a long time ago. The reason that I was moved by the things that I found to write the book was that I think that these events tell us much more about why things are the way they are in America today than the slavery that preceded the Civil War. And I mean that in two ways. One is that the reality is that slavery - honest to God slavery in which black Americans were unable to begin the activities of freedom that would allow them to build wealth and over generations move into the kind of middle-class status that most white families have today. That process couldn't begin until 80 years later than most of us have generally believed. __EOS__ The other connection you make is the hostility that so many African-Americans feel toward the justice system in this country based, you believe at least in part, on this history of trumped-up, non-existent charges that could take people away into forced labor for years. __EOS__ Well, that's right. One thing that became clear to me in the course of working on this book and in conversations with living people who connect back to some of these events is, number one, almost no one understands that these events occurred whether they were black or white. And in fact, it's obvious why whites generally have tended to minimize these events. It's less obvious why African-Americans would but the truth is that many, many African-Americans for a very long time tried hard to forget the humiliations and the tragedies of many of these years. At the same time, one cannot read this book and have any question as to why an ingrained sense of suspicion and hostility toward the judicial system became a fundamental element of African-American perspectives.

50367," Yeah, and this plane was on a routine flight. At that period, we had B-52 bombers in the air 24 hours a day, ready to attack the Soviet Union. So this plane took off with two very powerful hydrogen bombs. And while it was flying, the pilot noticed there was a weight imbalance. And they needed to, essentially, dump their fuel and get back to the base. And while they were trying to get back to the base, the wait imbalance started to break apart the plane. And as the B-52 bomber broke apart midair, the crew was evacuating. And there was a lanyard in the cockpit, and it was the lanyard that one of the crew members would normally pull to release the hydrogen bombs. And the centrifugal forces of the plane breaking apart pulled the lanyard as though a human being had pulled it. Now, these bombs are dumb machines, and they didn't know the difference between a person pulling on a lanyard or centripetal forces. So the bombs were released as though we were over enemy territory and at war. One of those hydrogen bombs went through all of its proper arming steps, except for one. And when it hit the ground in North Carolina, there was a firing signal sent. And if that one switch in the bomb had been switched, it would have detonated, full-scale, an enormous - enormous - thermonuclear explosion in North Carolina. And it would have changed the course of history. This was just a few days after John F. Kennedy was inaugurated in a period of great optimism. And  if this hydrogen bomb had detonated in North Carolina, it would have sent lethal radioactive fallout as far north, perhaps, as Washington, D.C. And it would've been a catastrophe.__EOS__ And then, not so many years before that, there was another terrifying incident where - well, it was a family in South Carolina, and there was a B-47 carrying nuclear weapons. Tell us what happened there.__EOS__ Yeah, and this accident was less dangerous in the sense that the nuclear weapon did not include the nuclear core. So it couldn't have detonated full-scale and created a nuclear detonation. But the accident is worth knowing about because it shows how the most simple, unlikely events can set off, potentially, a catastrophe. A B-47 bomber was flying with an atomic bomb in this case - a very large atomic bomb. And there was a signal in the cockpit that it wasn't properly locked in to the plane. So they sent a crew member into the bomb bay. And he'd never been in the bomb bay, but he volunteered to do it - he was ordered to do it. And he went in there, and he's, you know, in this small enclosed space, trying to push the locking pin in by hand. And he was searching around for about 10 minutes in the Bomb bay. And he reached above it, and there was some air turbulence. He grabbed onto, accidentally, the manual bomb release. It's almost like out of the scene of ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and it's possible that Kubrik was inspired by this incident. The crewmember fell on top of the bomb and was very lucky to grab onto something in the Bombay before the bomb broke through the Bombay doors and fell downwards towards the ground. And this crewmember was literally hanging in the Bomb bay, looking down below thousands of feet at the ground. This atomic bomb fell. It hit. It landed in someone's yard. It exploded. It destroyed the house and the car and killed some chickens. But the family - the Gregg family was very, very fortunate that none of them were hurt.__EOS__ And to be clear, in this case, the atomic material didn't detonate, but the high explosives that were part of the weapon did - right?",0

And as an author of a memoir, what's your obligation to the reader?  Is      it to tell a really compelling tale or to be brutally honest with      yourself?  Those are some of the questions being asked about James Fry      and his best-selling memoir, ""A Million Little Pieces.""  Earlier this      week a Web site, The Smoking Gun, accused Fry of greatly exaggerating his      past and distorting key events in his book.

But the title of this CD, ""Tomorrow's Children,"" where did you come up with that? __EOS__ This is David Bernz speaking. I guess I should answer that.

50370," Thanks for having me.__EOS__ In general, when you're flying one of these massive jets, one of these passenger airliners, what is it like just landing? What is going through your head as you are getting that plane ready to get back on the ground?__EOS__ I think from a passenger's point of view, watching one of these huge machines come into land, there's a certain excitement to it. I mean, all of that weight, all of that machinery, you know, being guided onto a runway. But for pilots, you know, it's not something we take for granted, but at the same time it's something that we're trained to do and that we do all the time. It does become routine to a point. The idea that every landing would be this huge dramatic event, I think, wouldn't be healthy from a pilot's perspective.__EOS__ Can you talk more about your personal experiences flying into San Francisco International?",3
50371," Sure. It's - but this has been going on for awhile. There must be a fairly large community of these boys at this point. __EOS__ Exactly. I mean - and it's, again, it's hard to get the exact estimates. And there are still kids coming out. You know, we just learned of another 15-year-old boy that is trying to leave right now, that, you know, is on his way out. So it was a big tide, and now it's a little bit more of a trickle. But what's happened is is that there is a sort of underground railroad of boys. And they, you know, crowd together in apartments and they help each other out. They get construction jobs under the table. And they kind of recreate a family setting with each other. You know, sometimes that's not so great because it's a bunch of, you know, a pack of dogs hanging out and drinking. But they also do create a family setting, and the older generation helps them. __EOS__ Let's get a caller. And this - Barbara is with us, calling from Chico in California. __EOS__ Hi. I wanted to say I so know what this is. I was a that 14-year-old girl who was beaten, who ran away, who couldn't articulate what abuse was. You don't have the language. I didn't grow up with LDS, but a strict Polish Catholic father, the youngest of seven children, and only one brother, all sisters. I ran away. My father - my mother said - she begged me to come home over the phone, and I said I'll come home if daddy promises not to beat me. ",1

But Leow says they didn't know what it was. __EOS__ Necessity is the mother of invention, in that Chinese musicians and Chinese labels and everybody that's in this industry is getting pushed so hard and trying to figure this model out that maybe they'll come on a solution before someone in the U.S. does. __EOS__ Neocha sells advertising and they split the revenue with the artists. They don't even bother trying to sell the music because there's so much piracy in China, there is no point. One way Neocha promotes the music is with an online music player called Next. Turn it on and you can listen to a random sampling of songs by Neocha musicians. __EOS__ Don't like that? Click the button that says, next, and you get something else. ",2
50373," Well, NATO guarantees the security of Estonia, but I also see them as organizations that helped us very much become more firmly democratic, and that's one of the reasons I think why so many countries aspire to membership, because in addition to the security and the well-being, it makes these societies far more stable. __EOS__ But does it mean to you that you assume Europe and for that matter the United States would respond differently to a conflict between Estonia and Russia than it has responded to Georgia and Russia? __EOS__ Well, there is the famous Article 5 in NATO, the sort of Three Musketeer clause, as it were - one for all and all for one -and in fact it is a collective security treaty, which means that indeed were something to happen, NATO would respond, just as we went into Afghanistan when NATO called us. __EOS__ It appears that in the cease-fire agreement mediated by France, the Russians were permitted a clause that permits them to, and I quote, implement additional security measures. Some read that as a loophole that allows for the Russian army to do what it wants in Georgia right now. ",3

When I saw a piece of paper when ""Four Weddings"" was released, which had their guesses of how much money the movie would make in different countries around the world, and by the United States it said $0. So, I've always just made films I want to make, and then hope that people in other countries like them. __EOS__ You want to play DJ for a second? ",1

50376," Is there a song on the album where you really feel like that comes through?__EOS__ It's like the last song that was really interesting sort of journey of passing hands from person to person.__EOS__ Yes, remind us what song that is.__EOS__ This song is called ""Sun in Your Eyes."" The beginning of ""Sun In Your Eyes"" is sometimes I would just ask Ed to go to the piano and just play whatever he thought of. And the very first riff of that song was something that he just went and played at the piano, those first few notes.",2
50377," Ben, you've described all of these challenges that working with Nick's lyrics present you. Ultimately, is this harder or easier than writing your own material to fill an album? __EOS__ I mean I think it's easier. It's easier because Nick gives me the framework, the life that I'm responding to with melody. Otherwise I respond to my own life or things that I observe or things that I feel, and melodies come to me constantly. __EOS__ Are we going to hear that in a song from a future album. __EOS__ Probably not. I have all kinds of garbage in my head that hopefully never gets anywhere. But, you know, the thing about writing to Nick's framework is that, once I'm finished responding to the life that he's sort of created there, we have a finished song. ",2
50378," Oh, yes. Oh, sure.__EOS__ So one of the things you describe is how advertisers are actually dividing us into these categories that are kind of weird. What are some of the categories we're being divided into?__EOS__ Well, most of them have to do with demographics like age and gender and income.__EOS__ Yeah, we're all used to that.",3
50379," Didn't Bennett Miller join this production in midstream?__EOS__ Yes, there were several starts and stops. And he was the third director to pick this thing up. First was David Frankel, and then Steven Soderbergh, and then Bennett came in.__EOS__ What happened?__EOS__ Well, we came up to the last minute. We were supposed to be filming days before, and when the studio head seen the script they didn't like the price. They had no problem with the story. But at that price, they could not justify it. And we could not bring it down to a price that both sides would be happy with, so we had to start over.""",1
50380," One of the things you're most concerned about now regarding the subject of your book is that a lot of things that the military - that we expect the military would be doing, the CIA has taken over. And I think you're largely talking about the drone program there.__EOS__ I think that there is a tendency to make things secret in the national security field, in part because I think that operationally, if you don't know whether or not making something public is going to be detrimental to your task, you don't want to risk it, and so secrecy is a better option if you have the choice.__EOS__ You're concerned that going to war is no longer painful for the entire country. The military and the families of people in the military bear the brunt, but because so much of the work has been assigned to private military contractors, and because we have a volunteer army, and because our taxes have been lowered and not raised, you think that, you know, most Americans aren't really feeling the costs of the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq.__EOS__ I don't think anybody set out to make us so divorced from the wars that we wage. I don't think anybody planned, 20 or 30 years ago, that they'd like America to be at war, and maybe two of the longest simultaneous land wars we've ever had, and not much notice when one of them ended, which is what happened this past December when the Iraq war ended and the civilian population here essentially shrugged.",0

And, you know, it's something that I really love doing. I've always really loved playing characters with secrets. I feel like there's so many more layers to play with there and scenes where you come into contact with another actor becomes so much more sort of dynamic when there's something you're withholding. I find even roles where there isn't a secret, I try to create one, just because I think the possibilities then are endless and you can surprise yourself more often, which I think is the greatest joy of being an actor is when you do something that you didn't expect.__EOS__ Sarah Polley, that was in 2003. I don't think you knew yet about your mother's secret, did you?__EOS__ I didn't know. That's really fascinating. You don't know what your subconscious knows, though, before you do, so that's fascinating.",1
50382," Well, the - I don't know if it's just originalists or not, but the well-regulated militia in the preamble to the Second Amendment identifies the purpose of the provision, and it seems to me it conveys a very strong message to the ordinary reader, whether he's an originalist or whatever might be a different form of interpretation, that they were basically concerned about protecting the state militias, not protecting individuals or hunters or things like that because at the time there were state constitutional provisions out there that were not so limited by the phrasing.  They talked about the right to use guns for hunting and other purposes. __EOS__ I guess I'm wondering if it seems a little topsy-turvy to have you arguing  No, literally the Constitution said the guns are for a well-regulated militia and having the originalists saying no, no, no, the rights are really broader than that. __EOS__ Well, that's exactly right. I think it's - it's a very ironic decision because it seems to me that the more you looked at the text and the drafting history of the Second Amendment the more you come to the conclusion that the current court's reading of the amendment is much broader than what the draftsmen expected. __EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is John Paul Stevens, who was a Supreme Court justice from 1975 until 2010.

Tim, what do you find most interesting about the tape that we just heard?__EOS__ You can hear what a master J. Edgar Hoover is at stroking presidents, at flattering, cajoling, telling them what they want to hear, telling them what they need to know. The president of the United States, LBJ, had put Hoover in a very difficult position because he had ordered Hoover into the civil rights movement on the side of integration, a side with which Hoover was philosophically at war.__EOS__ ""I want you to have the same kind of intelligence that you have on the communists.""

So there's a built-in governor as far as I'm concerned. __EOS__ Maybe not with younger guys, but with me who has poor balance, right? __EOS__ Let's see if we can get another caller on the line.

I fell down so here I lay, got the workman's comp so everything is okay. __EOS__ When did you start to think about, God, I can tell somebody's personal stories in a song? __EOS__ Well, it kind of came to me by default in that I was in a band that actually had a lead singer and songwriter. He left the band, and we were left with the remainder of the band. And since nobody else would step up to the plate, I ended up doing it, so then I started looking at music a whole different way from a songwriter's standpoint. But I only was able to do it by talking about what I knew about. ",2
50386," Hello. __EOS__ Hello. __EOS__ Pete, is that part of the story, right, that this really come to you in a dream? __EOS__ Not so much a dream, but a time of not dreaming.

And I was explaining to him oftentimes      it's, you know, what you say, it's the delivery and whatnot, but      sometimes it's--the best jokes have a double meaning, a double entendre.      So double entendre became the phrase for the day.  All day long he was      trying to find--this has two meanings, this has two meanings. __EOS__  What was it that took you from a wondrous conversation with your      child to trying to put it in book form? __EOS__  Having conversations with friends, you know, just talking      about it.

50393," You know, and I think a lot of people today would regard these close collaborations between the government and industry as sort of sinister. I mean, you know, the NSA and, you know, capturing all our data from digital companies.__EOS__ You know, it was interesting that they - there were of people who believed it was sinister back then as well. This is of course when George Orwell's ""1984"" was coming out - it was published in 1948. And people thought the computers would lead to Big Brother-like government, but the people who were developing both the Internet and then the personal computer realized that you had to make it personal. You had to give access and power to each of the individuals, and that would help the system from becoming Orwellian. And that's why we have a very decentralized Internet and sort of this system where anybody can post anything anywhere and send information anywhere.__EOS__ Yeah. Well, they were designing it. It could've functioned out of a central hub - right? - I mean, why didn't...__EOS__ Right. And the people who were designing it decided for two reasons not to centralize control of the Internet. One was the reason given by the colonels in the Pentagon is they wanted to make sure that the Russians couldn't send a nuclear attack on some hub and destroy our communications system. So they wanted a system that was distributed, but the people who were actually building this system, they weren't really thinking about Russian attacks. They were kind of rebellious, antiauthoritarian types; they wanted power to the people. They called it computing power to the people, and so they created a system in which every node on the Internet has the ability to store, to forward, to originate information in packets. And these packets just scurry around as if they were in a spider's web, and if one of the little nodes on the spider's web disappears, the packet just scurries around and gets to where it wants to go using another route. So this decentralized system made it hard for the Russians to blow it up, but also made it hard for the government or corporations to control the Internet.",3

Who needs reasons when you've got heroin? __EOS__ And that's from the film ""Trainspotting,"" directed by our guest, Danny Boyle. This, of course, is a story about five friends, five young guys, in Edinburgh, Scotland. Some of them were in and out of heroin use, and there's a compelling scene early on that immediately immerses you in this world of heroin users, the one early on where they're in the apartment. Would you just talk a little bit about creating that world? __EOS__ It's based really on this extraordinary book by Irvine Welsh, who was himself plagued by a relationship with the drug. And he, frankly, says that you never ever - although you give it up, it never ever leaves you. You know, it's always waiting there for you at your lowest moments for your return to it. And it was a book of enormous truthfulness and power and surprise, really, because he told the story completely from the inside of the people. So, you sensed very controversially their joy in their dependence on it, what they got from it. So, it's a disgusting but also an incredibly vivid and alive picture of these people, really. __EOS__ You've done such an interesting mix of films. You've got ""Trainspotting,"" which is this intense look at heroin users, and you've got ""Millions,"" which is this beautifully touching, kind of, child fable, science-fiction film, ""Sunshine,"" and then ""28 Days Later,"" which is this film of flesh-eating zombies.

50395," A big part of your book  and I noticed that the illustrations are just magnificent in the book. Did you do  you did those yourself. I mean, usually  I mean, when I write books, I hire somebody because I can't even draw a stick figure to play hangman. But you seem to do such a great job in that. Have you always been that talented? Have you always wanted to illustrate your own stuff? __EOS__ Well, you know. I never really thought of myself as an artist. I mean, I do, you know, try to represent what I see, and I do it by photography, as in this book, and also sometimes photographs aren't adequate, and so you draw. __EOS__ That's interesting. A big part of your book is devoted to something I think about a lot when I see different birds, and that is egg coloration. I mean, what can you tell about a bird by the way the egg is colored, or mottled, or spotted or whatever? __EOS__ Oh, there's  it's hard to know where to begin, but basically, egg color is ultimately related to camouflage. And the most common camouflage is if eggs are deposited on the ground, and there's little nest, and the eggs have to be left alone without the bird sitting on them for a while, because incubation has to start after all the eggs are laid, so they are left alone, such as shore birds, for example. If they start to incubate after the first egg is laid and sat on it, the birds themselves might be camouflaged. But let's say if it was white and they left it, it would immediately be visible to crows, ravens, all kinds of other birds who - they all love to eat eggs. ",0

NBC reported there was an 18 percent drop in divorce filings in one region thanks to the bad economy and, I guess, people just saying, I can't deal with this. But less than a week later, ABC said the hard financial times had triggered a 20 percent increase in divorce filings. How do you think you get such different takes on the issue? I mean admittedly, one was more regional. But what does that say about what people think at times like this? __EOS__ Well, I do think the region makes a big difference. You have a place where - such as New York - where one place is where you have different economic realities, it may be different than somewhere else. But I think both things are true. And I also think it depends on the level of economic distress. Finances is a stressor to marriage. It's not the end all. It's an extra stress that's put on a marriage. The statistics even show that when there is a significant or dramatic increase in income, that that is an added financial stressor that leads to an increase in divorce. ",3
50397," I mean, that's not just anger at the state of society. That is very personal.__EOS__ People personified it. I mean, it was called Thatcherism. I mean, it was - she became more than just a person. She became a kind of shorthand for ruthlessness, a kind of callousness, a disregard for working people. And it wasn't just a sort of political response. It was a gut, emotional response. Because don't forget here, where I'm speaking - in the north of England - the affects of Thatcherism were quite visible. Factories closed down, mills closed down, mines closed down; and people were put out of work.__EOS__ People connected her directly to that. I mean...__EOS__ And of course, you've got to argue, she was an easy person to become a figurehead. She even looked like she should be on the prow of a ship. There is no such thing as society, she famously said - you know, the idea that profit was the ultimate goal.

Look, there are a lot of good men out there - I mean, you know, we can overstate this problem - and many men who are interested in settling down, and settling down early. But you know, traditionally and conventionally, men - women have married men slightly older than they are. This may be part of the reason, that men mature a lot more slowly. Certainly, boys mature more slowly than girls and women do. So, you know, look to the older men... __EOS__ ...is one I would say. But I do think that part of what we're seeing is just really changed cultural expectations. And I would disagree with Michael on this. I don't see the young men that I'm talking to as just inheriting their fathers' and grandfathers' idea of manhood or adulthood. On the contrary, I see them rejecting those ideas, and really not wanting to be part of it. And I think that that's what our caller here is noticing. __EOS__ Michael Kimmel, what do you think? ",0
50399," Good wind quintet music is both a matter of their harmonizing together and their being individual. __EOS__ Lawrence Viddes reviews classical CDs for Gramophone Magazine and Audiophile Audition website. He says woodwinds have become the heart of the modern orchestra, but quintets like Borealis offer an opportunity to hear these instruments outside of the orchestra. __EOS__ You know, the clarinet came latest to the quintet and it sort of brought something -- you can hear it in Mozart. There's something sexy about the clarinet. And then in the 20th century the clarinet became a jazz instrument, and you hear it in Gershwin, and on this record you hear that, sort of. You hear it like Gunther Schuller piece.

So he was always honing and fine-tuning everything that he was doing. And one of the interesting things about him that I really find admirable is that he had this persona in sort of salon society in Victorian London as this guy who was a great talker, but what has he ever done? And he was sort of known in society - he was sort of a Kardashian of his time. But he went on to do works of great substance and lasting value.__EOS__ I wonder whether the story of Oscar Wilde suggests that in order to be profoundly witty, you also in some way have to be profoundly unhappy or damaged in some way.__EOS__ That's interesting 'cause that comes back to the idea of wit as being a facet of creativity and the sort of eternal stereotype of the creative as a miserable person.__EOS__ Or wit as a defense mechanism.",0
50401," So, did the NYPD, when it had all of these native speakers from areas that were of great interest to the FBI and the CIA, did they develop specific information that you knew about that either helped build a case or that the FBI needed and helped build a relationship that allowed them to get information from other agencies? __EOS__ Well, by 2003, 2004, you have the FBI and the CIA coming to the NYPD and asking for help with foreign languages and with the intelligence product that's being generated. And there are a couple of cases that we know about that are well-documented, where, for instance, there were a couple of young guys in Brooklyn who were getting themselves all worked up about fighting against the United States and carrying out violent jihad and blowing up a subway station at Herald Square, and people in the Muslim community around them grew suspicious. Somebody called the police, and sometime not long after that, a young Bangladeshi guy shows up at the same mosque, starts going there, starts going to the bookstore where one of these conspirators worked, and he was an undercover cop. He had gone into the NYPD Police Academy, and David Cohen had spotted him, and they had pulled him out of the academy before he even graduated, sent him to live in Brooklyn under deep cover, and he only communicated with one sergeant in the intelligence division and that by email most of the time. But he thoroughly penetrated this group of guys, and eventually they were arrested, tried and convicted. __EOS__ The interesting thing about that case, as you described it in the book, is that this young man that you described, once he gets involved, at a certain point he backs out of the case, and another confidential informant gets involved and wears a wire and gets information about these two young fellows and their jihadist plans. But it's not so clear that they would have actually done anything without, you know... __EOS__ Well, this is... ",0

It turns out one was her own daughter, another completely unrelated young woman, who she loved and adored for having raised her 28 years. __EOS__ Well, it was shocking for the mothers to suddenly discover that the child they were raising was not really theirs. I remember speaking with Begonia's mother, and she didn't have her husband there. He had died about six years earlier. __EOS__ And in Delia's case, and she, again, is the identical twin who was separated and lived with a family not her own, in this rural setting, she ended up in a complete rupture with the parents that she was reared with, did not even invite them to her wedding. Why was that? __EOS__ Delia did not enjoy a close relationship with her parents. In fact, she was largely raised in her grandparents' house. And she didn't get along for many years, and she certainly clashed with her sisters, but she explained her disagreements with her parents as the usual adolescent difficulties that everyone goes through.

50404," Yeah. __EOS__ You know, it was said that you had raised quite a lot of money, and only a very small fraction went to charity. And I wanted to ask what happened there. __EOS__ That's not true. See, when you want to really know about it, you should ask the source. __EOS__ Okay. ",2
50405," Yeah. __EOS__ And Erroll Garner did it. I had to tell Columbia, when I was recording for them years ago, to dampen it. You know, because they had it almost as loud as the piano, you know? __EOS__ I was aware going into the sessions that it was something that he wanted de-emphasized. At the same time, as someone who's listened to Mose for a long time and registers that vocalizing is part of his thing, if we got rid of it completely, there was something for me that was diminished. It's a certain kind of glue in the track. I think it's always good when you're reminded that a human being is sitting there doing something. And I'm a sucker for it. __EOS__ Joe Henry, you - in your liner notes for the CD, you have this great description of Mose Allison being a link from Mark Twain straight through to Willie Dixon, with Chico Marx barking directions from the backseat, James Stewart at the wheel.

And after that he, you know, he would've been 47 years old in 1980, so he had plenty of career left to do. So he sold cars, he sold trucks and yeah, he hustled, you know, he had a kid to take care of so he had to make money somehow. __EOS__ Earlier you described your father as a very successful businessman but also very sad. __EOS__ Mm-hmm.

50408,"  Hi. __EOS__  Hi. __EOS__  Nice to hear your subject matter.  It's very funny to me.  I was      just last week going through my filing cabinet, and I thought, `I don't      need these statements from those credit cards from, you know, 18 years      ago.  And I went through them just--you know, it was just out of      curiosity.  And I found the receipt for the very first gift I bought my      boyfriend at the time who I had just started to see.  I had no idea what      the nature of the relationship was going to end up at, although I knew I      liked him.  It was a jean jacket, you know.  I was 27 years old.  And I      thought, God, it's too expensive.  Is it nice enough?  But I don't want      to be too nice; you know, I don't want him to think I'm pushy.  You know,      here I am, 18 years later, I'm actually in a parking lot to pick up our      children from school.  We ended up getting married. But it was a total      gas.  So I went through the rest of my statements--oh, what were, you      know--God, we were together then.  And I really had this sense about how      the longevity of our relationship--I felt kind of old, you know,      realizing that we had been together so long.  But, you know, it was just      a fun explore and... __EOS__  I wonder, Renee, does that jean jacket still fit? ",0

He has to leave two ships behind, and he only has two ships      left.  And he puts all his men on these two ships.  And bare in mind,      these ships are about the size of a Greyhound bus, and you've got, you      know, 60 men per ship crammed into this space.  These ships also are      beset with ship worms, and they're sinking so low that the water's almost      lapping up and over the--onto the deck. The water's almost even with the      decks.  And what he does is he sails almost due north and he runs the      ships aground on the coast of Jamaica. __EOS__  I guess I hadn't understood until reading your book that for      many, many years after his death he was figured to be just another      European explorer. __EOS__  Yeah, because what had happened is Amerigo Vespucci, who      America is now named after--he basically stole Columbus' thunder.  And he      wrote this magnum basically saying that he had discovered the Americas.      And meanwhile, because Columbus' heirs were trying to make sure that they      got more money out of the crown after Columbus' death in 1506, his name      was not allowed to be spoken in the royal court after about the--I think      1516 is the date.  So he quietly drifted away, and he was just seen as      some other guy who had made his way to the Americas along with some of      the other bumbling Spanish who had been there right about the turn of the      15th century, 16th century.

I guess everyone who loves her has their own reasons, and when I say everyone, I mean lots of people. Doris Day is the biggest female box office star in Hollywood history. She started singing in big bands when she was a teenager, made her first film when she was 24, and after making about 40 movies, walked away from that part of her life in 1968. After that, her mission was rescuing and caring for animals. Doris Day ended her public life many years ago. We phoned her at her home in California.",1

But the former Secretary of State says there is one major difference between them.__EOS__ I'm not really, actually, quite as driven as Connie.__EOS__ That's debatable, but Connie Rice is driven. Work seems to be her recreation. And she is relentless about bringing the LAPD and the communities it polices closer together for the entire city's benefit.__EOS__ Part of the story of this book is that incredible journey of how we worked with the sued LAPD, and then worked with them, to get them to understand their interests were at a change.

What was his role? I mean, he has that name that makes you...__EOS__ Makes you think about coincidence. But the name is totally coincidental, right?__EOS__ I fear that it is, even though it seems so tempting to believe that Sir Thomas Crapper gave his name to crap. But the word crap actually is another word that's very, very old. It was taken over from 17th-century England by the pilgrim fathers, and Americans were talking about things being crap even in the 17th and the 18th centuries.",0

And what you have there is a movement against racism, which is a civil rights movement. And then as we move forward, we begin to look at what were we in the culture. And there was a period where we actually begin to study and re-understand who we were as a people. And so the whole black consciousness, black power, black studies movement would have had on the most activist edge people in the street going power to the people. And this is where you get your black mayors in cities. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ You get urban areas.

And when she died he moved to Los Angeles. __EOS__ L.A. Times columnist, Steve Lopez. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ My guest is L.A. Times columnist Steve Lopez. His friendship with Nathaniel Ayers - the street musician suffering from schizophrenia - is told in his book ""The Soloist,"" which is now a movie, opening today. I spoke to Lopez last April when the book had just been published and the film ""The Soloist"" was in production. As - as you finished the book, Nathaniel Ayers was still refusing medication and wouldn't really see doctors about his schizophrenia. Is that where he is still? Do you ever see him seeking treatment for his - his mental illness? __EOS__ I hope. I have hopes that he will. There are still these signs of slow steady progress. Recovery, as I learned, is not linear. You've good days and bad. But he does have a little music studio, and he likes to go in there and play music. He called me this morning. It's - it's the 7 a.m. call that I get. And he said that, you know, Mr. Lopez, Mr. Crane up at the L.A. Philharmonic said that maybe we could do a recording session.

50418," First why or how? How was it that a person who had been identified by people who had survived Mauthausen concentration camp, how is that he was never charged as a war criminal?__EOS__ Well, there was a general belief that all the Nazis were hiding in South America, in Argentina and Brazil and Chile. And it was a lot harder, especially in the years when Egypt and Israel were bitter enemies and fighting wars, it was very, very difficult to operate there and to find someone like Aribert Heim.__EOS__ Heim lived in Cairo for some years under a German pseudonym. And then very late in life he converted to Islam and took an Arabic name. What did you make of his conversion? Was it a sincere spiritual event, or was it going deeper cover in Cairo?__EOS__ I think that to be that kind of chameleon, you kind of have to believe the role that you're playing, in a way. I think that on the one hand, changing his name to Tarek Hussein Farid made it much harder to find and capture Aribert Heim. On the other hand, he was described to my co-author, Souad, and I as someone who was a perfect Muslim, knew every greeting, went to prayers regularly, was beloved in the community. He fit himself in.",0

She asked him why he felt so strongly about the Afghan cause. __EOS__ I was outraged, of course, Christmas of 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan for no reason other than simple aggression.

50421," So I feel like I should start on this note, you know, that ""The Help"" is, in its own way, a very controversial film. I'll just paraphrase Melissa Harris-Perry, who's a regular commentator on MSNBC and a professor of political science at Tulane and the author of a new book about stereotypes of black women.__EOS__ Absolutely not, or else I wouldn't have done it. You're only reduced to a cliche if you don't humanize a character. A character can't be a stereotype based on the character's occupation. Now I have, in the past, when I was starting my career, have played some pretty one-dimensional characters on page. They have had more upstanding occupations, so there hasn't been as much controversy surrounding them, but absolutely, their humanity was not explored.__EOS__ So did you imagine a life for her beyond what was written?__EOS__ Oh, absolutely, because that's my job as an artist. You know, when you go into the theater, whether it be to watch a film, whether you're watching television or whether you are watching live theater, people want to have a human event.

Her album ""Tapestry"" struck a chord with a whole new legion of fans, including me.__EOS__ With her first husband, lyricist Gerry Goffin, Carole King wrote many hits for other performers in the '60s, including ""One Fine Day,"" ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow,"" ""Up on the Roof,"" ""A Natural Woman,"" ""Take Good Care of My Baby,"" ""The Locomotion,"" ""Chains,"" ""Don't Say Nothin' Bad About My Baby"" and ""I'm Into Something Good.""__EOS__  Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time.

50424," You had some experience with this, having worked through this eating disorder. How did this moment come to you? Did you think, I just got to stop looking at myself? I mean, did it come to you just like that?__EOS__ The idea came to me just like that, because it was actually the day after I bought the wedding dress. I was in St. Louis, where my parents live, and I found the wedding dress with my mom, just like you're supposed to. Wasn't very happy with the situation, wanted to get my mind off of it, so I started a new book.__EOS__ Really? Okay. Even though you're engaged? Would have kind of been tough on your fiancee.__EOS__ Well, yeah, you know, I had to, like, back up the idea a little bit, and use it as I could. So the way I interpreted it was, you know, well, what if I just found a way to stop seeing myself in mirrors and other reflective surfaces for a good chunk of time, to really focus my attention away from my appearance and toward the things in my life that are more in line with my values, so my work, my relationships.",0

Sweeny Todd is with us swimming in our head all the time.__EOS__ If you are just joining us, my guests are Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez.

And we have been used as characters for villainy and monsters well before I was here. And so I deal with it in a very mature way. I'm not going to stop being who I am. I'm not going to restrict myself as an artist. And my simple argument is this - if you're not intelligent enough to understand that this is a character within a record - the same way Bob Marley didn't shoot a sheriff, the same way Johnny Cash didn't shoot a man in Reno to watch him die - then you're not intelligent enough to communicate and discourse with me. I don't want to get pulled into defending the black male image because of the art I make. But I understand that comes with it. Because really they're not afraid of the rapper. What they're really saying is I believe this about black men.",2

50428," Do you - no, go ahead.__EOS__ It's very interesting. Right after the 11th Circuit en banc court ruled, there was a huge controversy that came out, because Mr. Bowers came out - hang on - and admitted publicly that he had been having a 10-year adulterous affair. Sodomy was illegal in Georgia, as was adultery. And he was running for governor at the time, and ended up - he had been really the favorite, and ended up losing that primary, but was given a lot of heat by the press and the public for having been hypocritical.__EOS__ So what was the rest of your life after that? You were able to, you have been able to work as an attorney. What happened next? After the job offer was revoked, I assume you had to go on and get another job. Were you able to?__EOS__ Yes, and it's interesting because with my graduating at the level that I did, had I not been fired and had it been very public, I really realistically could have gone to a big firm if that's what I wanted, although that never was what I wanted. I worked in private practice for a couple of years, and since then, for about 18 years, have been working as a lawyer for the City of Atlanta.",3
50429," Well, you know, I think most of them were expecting it to be like the colonial wars, because this is what the armies of England, France and Germany had fought in recent decades, leading up to the war. Europe had been at peace for some 40 years or so, and the wars had taken place by European armies against very poorly armed Africans and Asians - you know, putting down rebellions on the frontier in British India, conquering new territories in Africa, putting down rebellions against the British and French and German colonial rule. __EOS__ World War I is famous, among other things, for its trench warfare, where there was literally a front line, and trenches of French and British on one side and Germans on the other. How did it become this type of trench warfare where nobody could move and territory wasn't gained? __EOS__ Well, this took everybody by surprise. And there's a scholar who actually searched through a lot of British army reports and came up with some extraordinary quotes from generals writing to each other in the first year or two of the war, saying this war is not normal. And maybe soon we'll get to normal conditions, but this is definitely very, very abnormal. __EOS__ What were some of the worst horrors of trench warfare? ",3
50430," And then another thing that happened in your life - and very few people can say this. You married the person who was one of your idols when you were young.__EOS__ Connie Smith.__EOS__ Yeah, the country music singer Connie Smith. And you went to see her when you were - what? - 12?__EOS__ My mom took my sister Jennifer and me to see Connie Smith when she came to our town of Philadelphia. And there's the Choctaw Indian Reservation - the Mississippi band of Choctaws - they have a great fair that still goes on down there every year, but Connie Smith was the star. She was a RCA Victor recording sensation, and she came to our town and sang her songs in July of 1970. And she looked so pretty to me. I thought she was an angel. And I got my picture made with her that night and got her autograph. And on the way home, I told my mom - I said, I'm going to marry Connie Smith someday.  So it took me 25 years to talk her into it, but we're happily married for almost 20 years now.",2
50431," And I have to say yes, you say all the leaders were killed at the - removed from the equation in part to present a more docile, malleable group of pawns, cattle if you will. It doesn't speak well of us that there's only a few that will rise up. __EOS__ Well, you know, the thing is, the thing that is very shocking on the opening of the book is that it's two years later, and essentially the opening passage ends up saying what was really troubling, what was really brutal is the fact that we got used to it, you know, the fact that a lot of the people got used to - you know, as long as they had their TV time, and they had transportation, and they had food, a lot of the people fell into place. __EOS__ The truth about silver is that it's a sovereign element that is very effective against vampires. __EOS__ Yes, and it becomes sort of a black-market item, and it becomes incredibly valuable. And the book, you know, I tried - we tried very hard to create a Mobius strip between what is the spiritual and what is scientific, you know. ",0
50432," It's a very typical problem.__EOS__ My first question is...__EOS__ Well, let's address this problem.

50433," Not at all.__EOS__ On stage, you see, when you're on stage in front of an audience, you're kind of in control. When you're off of the stage or in a situation where there are a lot of people, you're not in control, and I felt awkward. So I went into show business thinking it would give me a little more, I could overcome that shyness.__EOS__ Where do you think the shy emanated from?__EOS__ I bought it in Chicago.",3
50434," Stone Creeson, the character you're playing, he is a manipulative character... __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ ...and he uses his wife, played by the stunning Milla Jovovich, to seduce his parole officer so that he can then try to blackmail him, is that the idea? __EOS__ Yes. He's so anxious about the review process and about his upcoming parole opportunity that he - his wife, who loves him very much and is willing to do almost anything, he literally sends her at De Niro's character to seduce him. And I think that's where the film starts to become interesting, because even as he is scrambling to do whatever he thinks he needs to do and say, the interactions between the three of them start becoming increasingly complicated because what seems like it's, at first, just a plot starts to become, in everybody's case, sort of an authentic inverting of their positions in the conversation.

50439," That encounter prompted Grenier to try to make sense of this world of celebrity worship. __EOS__ It allowed me to see that something was off. That, now that tabloid obsession and celebrity culture had trickled down to our kids, I knew that it'd gone too far and I had to investigate more. __EOS__ We also see in Austin this craving for celebrity that, I think, you identify with, and in the film, the point is made that, to some extent, everybody identifies with. __EOS__ Yeah. You know, I mean, I'm on ""Entourage."" It's what we indulge and promote. I think in a lot of ways, celebrities represent the American dream. They have financial fluidity and options at their disposal. It's no wonder that the kids, especially when they see it promoted, that celebrity is this desirable, attainable thing, of course they're going to go for it. ",1

50444," And I think everybody else loves it, too. __EOS__ Okay, and then you kind of moved from the jubilee style into sort of more of the gospel style... __EOS__ Well, yeah. We graduated from jubilee, although we still do jubilee, and then we came to traditional gospel music. Now we do it all. We do jubilee, we do traditional gospel, we do contemporary sometimes, even though personally I don't like that, but you change with the times. You know, some people like contemporary, so we have to - we try to please everybody. __EOS__ What don't you like about contemporary? ",2
50445," Well, the Lunts built levels into Ten Chimneys for no other reason than it makes for great entrances. Alfred did - when somebody asked why he'd put so many stairs in the house, said, stairs are perfect for two things, making great entrances and making love on. I say we take the entrance. __EOS__ All right. That's great. Oh, this room is just beautiful. In the drawing room, biblical murals enliven each wall. The murals in the house were painted by set designer Claggett Wilson, who came for a month and stayed, by some accounts, for two years. __EOS__ I do love in particular that all of the stories on the wall sort of flow onto the ceiling. And so sometimes it's clouds flowing from the top of the wall onto the ceiling, it's - or the smoke from the burning bush or Jacob's ladder. Wherever you look, the manna from heaven starts on the wall but goes all the way onto the ceiling. And then if you look straight up, you see a whole bunch of cherubs, all of which have Alfred's face. __EOS__ Alfred himself helped paint, measure and trim. Once a stage - that is, a room - was set, it stayed that way. In the drawing room is a Steinway piano painted white with vines running over it, where Noel Coward used to entertain. Itching to hear it ourselves, we asked pianist Jamie Johns, accompanied by singer Gary Briggle, to play a Coward favorite. ",3
50446," common reads. Colleges and universities assign the same book for freshman to read over the summer and follow it up with a discussion once they arrive on campus. Up first in our Freshman Reads series is Sonia Nazario's widely read book ""Enrique's Journey."" Since its release in 2006, freshmen across the country have been absorbed by the story of a Honduran boy's perilous trek across borders in hopes of reuniting with his mother in the United States after 11 years of separation.__EOS__ It's an honor to be here. Thank you, Lynn.__EOS__ Now, your book revolves around a very important, very sensitive, very timely topic in this country right now  immigration. So why do you think that is a good subject for a book that freshmen will be reading as they start college?__EOS__ Well, I think in terms of college, a lot of colleges look for a checklist of 10 different things that they're looking for in a book. And much to my delight, ""Enrique's Journey"" had a lot of those elements. I think what's unique about it is that it broadens an awareness of cultures other than what most people know, and it promotes global awareness, which is one of those things on that checklist. But it's also about something that's happening in a lot of these students' backyards.",0
50447,"  What did you learn from working with Phil Spector and Leiber and Stoller, great producers, that you applied to Philadelphia International Records? __EOS__  Phil Spector had a whole different approach. __EOS__  Like what?  What did he do? __EOS__  You know, the wall of sound, you know.  You know, you have every individual musician play their part down and then he worked for hours on the drum sound, and he'll tell all the musicians to take a break.  And he'll be in there like two or three hours just working with them drums.  So if you listen to his productions, then you'll see that it sounded like nothing else. ",2
50448," That definitely sounds like 1969 there, doesn't it?__EOS__ Yeah, love it.__EOS__ And here's ""Godzilla"" from 1998.__EOS__ All right. So you get the assignment to craft the new roar. Let's hear it first.",1
50449," What can humanitarian missions and military missions learn from each other? What can soldiers and relief workers learn from each other? __EOS__ In order for us to be effective in any operation, one of the keys that's essential for us is that we have allies, and that we have a really deep knowledge of what's actually happening in the local culture. __EOS__ You were about to leave Oxford and had attractive offers on the outside, but you went to a fancy dinner for Rhodes Scholars and had what amounts to a revelation there. Do you recall that? __EOS__ I do. I was at this dinner for Rhodes Scholars. And we were in the Rhodes mansion, which is this fancy mansion on the Oxford campus. And I remember I looked up in the rotunda, and I saw that etched into the marble were the names of Rhodes Scholars who had left Oxford, and had fought and died in World War II. ",0
50450," It's very nice to be invited along, thank you. __EOS__ And as you point out in your book, Antony and Cleopatra lost and ultimately had very little influence. Why is their story so famous when it might have ended up as a footnote? __EOS__ I think it's the drama, the fact that these two people are politically so important, and they're lovers. So you get the combination. You know, there are famous romances, but they're not necessarily between two key players in a power struggle that's shaping the Roman Republic, that's going to go on to dominate the world for the next 500 years. So it has a bit of everything in it. __EOS__ And there is also the sense of eras ending and new things beginning, that this was a tipping point in a lot of ways. ",0
50451," Thank you for having me with you today. __EOS__ Now, I understand that your schools are not just noted for their academic excellence. In fact, they're called excellent with distinction, according to the Ohio Department of Education. But the district's also been noted for its aggressive residency enforcement, which reportedly includes private investigators checking on parents' living arrangements, and that families can earn $100 if they turn people in who don't live in the district. Is that all true, and how did that start? __EOS__ Yes. And we've had approximately 48 residency cases since 2005 - over the past five years; so approximately nine per year. In Ohio, you need to go to the school district where you reside. In our district, we do not have open enrollment. Many school districts do not. And since we do not have open enrollment, you actually need to reside within our district boundaries to attend school here. __EOS__ And you said that your district, in particular, has had 48 of these cases over the last five years. Have any other of them gone to prosecution? ",3
50452," So I was just wondering  Why are those ceilings so high?__EOS__ Well, I think a lot of it is - was fashion, and it was just kind of showing off. I mean, in humbler homes, in Victorian times, the ceilings wouldn't have been high. Having a high ceiling was a way of demonstrating to the world that you were pretty well-off and that you could afford to be kind of extravagant with space.__EOS__ Oh, so it was a sign of prestige?__EOS__ Yeah. And, I mean, also, things like large windows would admit more daylight. So - and that was a big concern in former times, too, because as I talk about in the book at some length, you know, illumination was - in interior spaces was always a real problem.",0

50455," Well, I originally requested for me to be able to take a little sabbatical and go off to - what did De Niro do? He went off to Italy...__EOS__ To gorge yourself.__EOS__ ...and gorged himself with pastas and steaks, but that would have been fantastic. Unfortunately, they said, well, the film isn't going to be green-lit if we take a huge break. It's either got to be done this way or no way at all. So I donned a fat suit with a lot of weight. You know, there are over 100 different pieces to put on my face every day.__EOS__ Wow.",1
50456," Yeah. __EOS__ Here he is right now, folks. __EOS__ Williams cut a record with the Sadies a few years back. Over the past two decades, Williams has recorded 10 albums ranging from old school R&B to so-called  sleaze rock. Another one is coming out later this year. __EOS__ Do I want to retire? No, no, no. The answer to that is no. Im just going to keep doing what Im doing until my body tells me you cant do it no more, Andre, you know? And then Ill produce to kids in the studio. I dont intend to step out of music, I intend to lay down out of music - dead. But other than that I intend to participate in music as long as I live because that's all Ive ever done. That answer your question? ",2
50457," This was President Johnson at the time, yes. __EOS__ Okay, so let's hear it. __EOS__ Hey Tom, you know, I just read in the newspaper this week where President Johnson has now asked Congress to pass a series of taxes, you know, to discourage people from traveling abroad. What do you think about that? __EOS__ I read that, too, but I don't think he has to go that far. I don't think that's necessary to go that far with it. ",0

And he said, you know, if you run the numbers, this could be the highest crime area in the United States based on the number of people who've actually been brought out of here in handcuffs. __EOS__ That - I think that's quite true. __EOS__ Do you think the people who come to Chicago end up practicing politics any differently than anywhere else? __EOS__ I think politics is a local specialty in Chicago, the way that blues and improvisational comedy is a local specialty. And as a matter of fact, I think politics often resembles the blues and improvisational comedy in Chicago. ",0
50459," In fact, the prime motivating force behind the pirates was good old-fashioned profit. American and Irish entrepreneurs ran the two biggest stations trying to sidestep Britain's refusal to grant radio licenses to commercial broadcasters. In August 1967, the British government made it a crime to supply music, commentary, fuel, food, water and most significantly, advertising to any unlicensed offshore broadcaster. __EOS__ Well, it is my unfortunate duty to tell you and inform you right now that Peace and Love will be closing down on August the 14th. __EOS__ Most of the British pirates fell silent. Perhaps, not coincidentally, one month after the law took effect, the BBC launched its first pop music station. __EOS__ Radio One, go. ",1
50460," Upstairs in another part of the Met's maze, Nick Barnes and Mark Down of the Blind Summit Puppet Theater guide a child-sized puppet through its paces. The puppet's face is ethereal, not quite human, but its movements are perfectly childlike. So now you're making this little guy - he's trying - he's crawling up the chair, one knee at a time, and he's on - he's looking over the table, he's having a good time, just like a real child.  __EOS__ The puppet, dressed in an American sailor's suit, plays Cio Cio San's little son by her faithless husband, Pinkerton. In most productions the boy is played by a real child, but director Anthony Minghella rejected this. __EOS__ For me the issue was very simple, which was that if you are saying that there is no requirement or expectation in the audience to see a young Japanese girl singing the part of Cio Cio San, why is there a requirement to see a two and half year old Eurasian boy? You know, you can't expect a toddler to have an imaginative life that they can harness onstage. And so all they can do is be pushed around, whereas with Blind Summit you know that this baby will think and feel everything you hope the baby would think and feel night after night after night, and will never distract and will only ever help us understand in the purest way what the emotions are. __EOS__ The Blind Summit puppeteers work in a Japanese tradition called bunraku. Like marionettes, Butterfly's little son is a floppy bundle of complex joints, but there are no strings. So he must be manipulated directly by three people. Mark Down works the puppet's head and one hand. Nick Barnes takes the feet. In performance there will be still another person holding the puppet's torso. But the three black clad figures seem to melt away like shadows behind the surprisingly realistic child. ",2
50461," Let me talk about the process a little bit. Maybe one of the songs might be a good way to go through it. Let's talk about ""Birth in Reverse."" Did the - I want to think that the groove came first.__EOS__ You know what came first, actually, is the - is all the music and the melody. I was doing that thing that often songwriters will do. I was just kind of mouthing nonsensical words and in some cases just, like, la-la-la-la-la, you know, like, whatever. You know what I'm saying?__EOS__  The dogs will bark, so let them bark. The birds will cry, I'll let them cry.__EOS__  ...along the line like a birth in reverse in America",2

50464," The fascinating thing is that my kids, who are 11 and six, they really couldn't care less about the movie. They're not allowed to see the movie because it's R rated and they... __EOS__ Oh, of course. __EOS__ ...they have not seen ""Knocked Up."" So when they shoot these movies it's just like a strange two week vacation where they see Seth and Adam a lot and there's a crew around and lots of candy on a craft service table. I try to get them excited about it, but they would rather watch the new 10 episode marathon of ""SpongeBob Square Pants."" So I guess that's healthy. You know if other people call and say you know can your kid be in my movie? We say no. __EOS__ My guest is Judd Apatow. He wrote and directed the ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up,"" and he made the new film, ""Funny People"" starring Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen. ",1
50465," I'm very concerned about extinction of bacteria in the human microbiome. I think this is a really critical issue. It's the microbiological equivalent of global warming, and that is that we are changing our microecology through practice, and that, I believe, is fueling the risk of these modern plagues, these epidemic diseases.__EOS__ You know, for animals who are endangered, there are animal refuges, and there are, you know, there are movements to protect endangered species and so on. Is there anything comparable going on with the microbiome, with bacteria that might be endangered?__EOS__ Yeah, so as you point out, we think that there are endangered bacterial species, that we have - that we people in the U.S. have much lower diversity than people who have not had the benefits of modern life. So my wife Maria Gloria Dominguez and myself and other investigators have been gradually studying peoples who have not been developed, people in the Amazon, people in the rainforest, people in different parts of Africa.__EOS__ A lot of people now are taking probiotics, and probiotics are, you know, capsules or pills or liquids that have good guy bacteria in them, and the goal is to keep a healthy microbiome in the gut through the use of these probiotics, which is the opposite of antibiotics. Antibiotics kill bacteria. Probiotics are supposed to propagate good guy bacteria. How effective do you think they are?",0
50466," I don't know. But A-Rod says, I've never heard of this rule. __EOS__ I mean, I think  I don't think Jeter would have ever done it. __EOS__ Derek Jeter. __EOS__ I don't think Derek Jeter would. I don't think Paul O'Neill would have ever thought of it. And I think one of the reasons why these things are important is you're likely to play, especially early in the season, you're liable to play another 10, 11 games with a team that's in your division, maybe even a dozen. ",3
50467,"  Yeah, I think so. __EOS__  Was it still usable afterwards? __EOS__  No.  But they were able to salvage some of their stuff out, but it      took several days for this crane to get there and get the RV out.  And      meanwhile, the people of the towns around Yellowstone helped them out and      to get them some things to live on until they got their stuff back. __EOS__  Well, again, it's the kindness of strangers.

50468," Well, all the... No assignment was an assignment where people were ordered to go to places. We generally assessed the day-to-day situation and photographers would go out according to their preferences. The Vietnamese would rather go out with Vietnamese troops, we had other Vietnamese photographers who loved the American Marines. If they did so, then let them go up there. They were all - almost all equally good. There were no bad photographers around. There was nobody who were second category. There's no room for mediocre talent in situations like this.__EOS__ Did you ever try to talk a AP photographer out of going to a certain place?__EOS__ Oh yes. Many times. I mean, I myself spent about 50 percent of my working life in Vietnam and in the fields. That means I would go out for five days and then stay inside around four or five days and play the editor for the others, and then go out myself again and leave another photographer at the editing desk. We took turns so we all had our experiences there. I being a little bit on the senior side, already, in these days I was 30 and older, so older than many of the young colleagues, and I tried to warn people. I tried to instill to them that they shouldn't go with bad troops. They should rather pull back and take care of themselves and look out in situations became dicey, and never ever be foolishly risking chances.__EOS__ What are bad troops?",3
50469," Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.__EOS__ So why did you decide to reach all the way back to Peter Gunn?__EOS__ We actually were able to get our hands on the original arrangements. Now to my knowledge, this is the first recording since 1958 which Mancini himself did. This the first recording of Mancini's original arrangement.__EOS__ As I recall the show, one of the places where a lot of the action happened was in a kind of a bar which had a jazz ensemble playing.",2

And they don't have service there, which was like really helpful.__EOS__ Key to creativity.__EOS__ Yeah, absolutely. But yeah, I had a pretty strong plan, actually, for what I was going to be doing. I had a skeleton framework. And I knew that I'd want - I wanted to write very quickly, so it's like a bunch of different furniture but - coming from, you know, in the same room.",2

They jacked him full of fluids, they, you know, they got his blood pressure going, getting up, they did all that stuff. And that stabilized him, kept him from going too far into shock, and that's what saved his life. __EOS__ Agent Jerry Parr, you were by the president's side. __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ At what point did you realize that this was a very serious situation?

And I guess I wonder, being a cop on screen so often, and looking back to ""Cop Killer"" 20 years ago - I mean, what do you reflect about?__EOS__ I mean, honestly, I've never been a cop hater. You know, when I was breaking the law, the cops were the opponent. I just thought I could outsmart them. Anybody who speeds thinks they can outsmart the cops. So at that time, you know, I was breaking the law. I knew what the law was; I was breaking it. Why am I mad at the police?",1

So forgive my curiosity, but one of my favorite scenes in the film is you and Philip Seymour Hoffman, the cult leader who's become like a father figure to you, you're both arrested and you're put in adjoining jail cells. And he's all about control. You know, he's all about controlling people and controlling everything, and it's always all about him.

50474," Boston University's Republicans Students Group is taking a stand against race-based programs. It's offering a scholarship for white students. __EOS__ If you get all scholarships based on, you know, economic need, that's one thing. But to base it just on race and race alone, when they're coming from the same communities that the white folks are - or any ethnicity is coming from - I don't think that provides much diversity on campus at all. __EOS__ All right, Michael. You have gone on the record on our show saying that you are not in favor of single race colleges. What about this move by this campus Republican group? __EOS__ Racially identifiable colleges. Look, this is a very interesting question, because this is a private group offering a race-based scholarship, as other private groups offer race-based scholarships. This is not the university offering race-based scholarships. But they are raising significant and substantial question. I mean, some of the student groups have affirmative action bake sales, where they have different prices for whites and minorities. It is an interesting catalyst to discussion. ",0

50481,"  No, you made sense, and my thinking about that is the      thinking of the big oil companies, which is that the big oil companies      are decreasing their investment in exploring for oil because the big oil      companies know better than anybody else how much oil there's likely to be      out there, and they've concluded that there are not big discoveries of      valuable oil fields out there waiting to be made, and so they're      investing less in oil, and some of them are starting to invest in wind      power and other stuff.  I'm willing to learn from the conclusion of the      oil companies themselves.  And similarly, with the Alaska National      Wildlife Refuge, it's not American oil companies who are crying out to      drill in the wildlife refuge; a number of them have said they don't want      to have anything to do with it.  There's not likely to be much there, and      it's politically too loaded. __EOS__  Terry, thanks for the call.  And one final e-mail question--this,      from Frank Landis at the University of Akron.  `I loved ""Collapse"" and      I'd like to ask Dr. Diamond to speculate.  What would a sustainable      global society--however you phrase it--look like?  Endemic warfare as in      Papua?  A permanent global caste of the wealthy and powerful?  What about      the Western ideal of technological and social progress?' __EOS__  A sustainable society--world society is going to be one in      which either there is not warfare or there's not warfare on a large      scale, as in the 20th century, because that almost by definition is not      sustainable.  It's going to be a society which recognizes world      interconnections, which recognizes that when some remote country like      Afghanistan or Somalia collapses, that now affects the rest of the world,      including the United States.  It's going to be a society with little      difference between the economies of First World and Third World countries      because it's just not viable, sustainable in the long run, for there to      be rich people consuming 32 times more resources than poor people.  And      it's going to be a society that is sustainable--that's to say that it's      consuming resources only at the rate at which those resources can be      grown or produced. __EOS__  Jared Diamond, thanks very much for being with us, and again,      congratulations on the new TV show.

That mix is on the Streisand box set ""Just For the Record."" So was your mother jealous of you or competitive with you when you started to have, you know, a career?",1
50485,"   And exactly what do you expect to find? __EOS__   Everybody's got a past, honey. __EOS__  I wondered why the role in ""Monster-in-Law"" appealed to Sykes. __EOS__  I really enjoyed that it wasn't written for an      African-American, and I think if I had read it, if it had been written      for an African-American, I probably wouldn't have accepted it, because      I'm sure it would have been a lot of `girlfriends' and all attitude and      no content, and I didn't want to play that part.

50486," This music is centuries old. And when you ask why it's being played in the jungle today, you learn something about the history of South America. Centuries ago, the Catholic Church established missions in some of the most remote corners of the new world. Music came with those missions, and now that music has been recovered and painstakingly restored. NPR's Julie McCarthy reports on an international Baroque music festival in the missions. __EOS__ ""Four Seasons,"" by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi, leaps from the strings of the young musicians from the Orchestra of the Mission of San Jose de Chiquitos. Of the eight mission towns known collectively as the Chiquitania, each has spawned a youth orchestra. __EOS__ Tiny toes curl around chair rungs as the musicians, some as young as eight, play. They perform barefoot and wear simple garb to express their Indian heritage. Their musical tradition is a cross-pollination of the cultural impulses of Europe and the indigenous traditions of the Chiquitano, the original inhabitants of this steamy, lush lowlands. __EOS__ Here in Chiquitania, we have these intense downpours that suddenly let up. Then you'll hear this crackling bolt of lightning, he says. And those accents are what we think of when we play this piece. ",2
50487," It's a matter of where I grew up, Michel. It's a matter of where I grew up. I grew up in San Gabriel Valley in a town next to at that time the second largest landfill in the country. Now it is the largest. It's called the Los Angeles Sanitation District. And of course, we're finding now evidence to show that where you put your garbage seeps into your water table. And there are many different contaminants, airborne as well as in the water and soil. These do have detrimental effects. We find it also in army bases where you find rocket fuel that's injected, for whatever reason, into our soil that penetrates our water table. __EOS__ Congresswoman, just one more question. We only have a minute left. But it says up here that as a political leader of color you seem to be one of the few that are very high-profile. It does seem to me that this is an issue that many people of color have difficulty engaging in. Is there an environmental issue that you most wish you could get the public to focus on, particularly the diverse communities that you represent? Just a minute if you will. __EOS__ I think that asthma and obesity have a lot to do with where we live. The lack of open space, the fact that we have contaminants in the air, respiratory diseases, contaminated water. All those factors need to be looked at. And we need to look at it in a more global area sphere in terms of health care, because if you don't take care of the health care these people are going to end up expending more money when they have to go to a trauma unit. __EOS__ Sure.

50489," Did you remember shooting that and what the director told you about how to cry? __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ Was that the first time that you had to like cry on demand? __EOS__ Actually to get that part, when I auditioned for that part I had to cry. There's really a seam in this interview. ",1
50490," Okay. And thanks very much. It prompts me... __EOS__ Thanks, man. __EOS__ ...it prompts me to ask, though - I wonder, you guys play such different kinds of music some of the time. Are your audiences the same? Are they different? How are they different, Chick Corea? __EOS__ I think there's a little bit of crossover, but we're still experiencing what that's like. We've already been on a couple of tours. We played a number of concerts - lots and lots of fun. We're kind of looking at the audience, you know, I'm going, wow, that's - those are definitely Bela fans, I could tell. ",2
50491,"  Well, we've put a ballpark out of 300 billion. It depends on the amount of volunteer participation we get from homeowners.  So, the reality is, we don't know for sure.  But remember, this is one way to recapitalize the banking system.  So, if we go down this route, we both save many Americans from leaving their homes.  We'd get the capital into the banking system, and we don't have to do some of the other things that are being discussed underneath the other initiatives. __EOS__  Well, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, thanks very much. __EOS__  My pleasure. __EOS__  Douglas Holtz-Eakin is senior policy adviser to the McCain campaign.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",3
50492," No...__EOS__ ...In some way that maybe you wouldn't like.__EOS__ No. I don't read many novels because I write them, and I want them to be perfect. And I can't tolerate imperfection when I read fiction, and how often do you see perfection? But going to the movies, you've got a good story, a crime, a man meets a woman. You can always go to look, and it's only going to cost you 10 bucks and two hours.__EOS__ James Ellroy, a pleasure talking with you.",1
50493," Well, first of all, attend is an old fashioned word, so right away you know you're not in the 20th century. And the happenstance - the happy happenstance of the T sounds - attend the tale of Sweeney Todd - gives it an old ballad feeling because of the semi-alliteration there. And tale tells you right away this is not going to be a realistic story. This is not - you're not meant to take this at face value because if you do, you'd scream with laughter. I mean, you know, that's an outrageous story, if you try to treat it seriously. It has to be treated as a melodrama. It has to - you have to tell the audience we are not - this is not supposed to be real, folks. Now, of course, it's a musical so it's never real in a musical. __EOS__ two gangs are at war and murders and deaths occur as a result. And - whereas ""Sweeney Todd"" is strictly about, in a sense, cartoon figures. __EOS__ Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd, his skin was pale and his eyes were odd. He shaved the faces of gentlemen who never thereafter were heard of again. __EOS__ So here's the opening chorus from ""Sweeney Todd."" ",0
50494," Yeah. __EOS__ ...you know, tons of industrial waste were dumped into the river, and that's why this monster was created. __EOS__ Did you grow up with religion? __EOS__ Yeah, though - yes, I grew up Catholic in the 1970s, and it was not a very rigorous religious upbringing. I stayed in the church right up to the point where I got confirmed at age 13, and that was basically considered - that was basically what we did. It was like just stay in, get confirmed. It was almost like I graduated from church. ",0
50495," He survived, yeah, okay. __EOS__ But yeah, we were looking for somebody - and you know, this is always a treacherous area to walk into as youre approaching something like a kid because its so easy to be cloying and sappy and/or just, like, bad acting, you know, and we wanted this to be authentic and real-sounding. And when we heard this kid, he came in, and like you say, he wasnt even planning to audition. __EOS__ So you cast Ed Asner as the older man. So did you have an idea of what he would look like before you cast Ed Asner, or like which came first in your mind? __EOS__ Well, we had the story, and we even designed the character. He was finished. We had him all - I dont think he was quite finished being built in the computer, but the design was there. And what we did, and we have done this on all the films, is we grab little snippets of dialogue from other movies, and so while were looking at these designs, we just listen. And some people just fit perfectly, and Ed was one of those guys. ",1
50496," Before we get you to detail some of the hijinks, remind us how good they were as actors and for that matter, how good Peter O'Toole, the last one standing, can still be. __EOS__ Well, I think you look no further than the Oscars. Burton, I think seven nominations. Criminal, actually, that they never received the Oscars they richly deserved. O'Toole in 2002 picked up a lifetime-achievement Oscar, didnt he? He gave that one last speech. It's very difficult to be a great actor and a genuine film star at the same time. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ They're quite exclusive. Burton, particularly, was a global superstar. Oliver Reed never quite made it in America, strangely enough. ",0
50497," Yeah.__EOS__ I know after the funeral, we both went back to work. But you had to go and be a pastor and do funerals and weddings.__EOS__ Oh, yeah. You know, it really got me when people would come by and would tell me stories about narrowly missing being killed in an accident. And they said, but my guardian angel protected me. And I just wanted to slam the door in their face and walk out, because I thought, where was Denny's guardian angel the night of February the 6th?__EOS__ The grief lasts a lot longer, I think, than most people think.",3
50498," ...taken over to some degree by KUT Radio. But that's more information than you probably want. __EOS__ Great. No. I'm happy to know. I love Austin. __EOS__ Well, Austin loves you. We would love to hear you here. The Cactus has not died. It's in transition. But KUT has taken over management of the Cactus, and they're working out an agreement with the University of Texas. So hopefully, it will still be here. Is Austin on your current tour? __EOS__ It's not on my June and July list of... ",2
50499,"  Now forgive me for not knowing this, Mr. Johnson.  But I mean, you're not the kind of composer who would ordinarily do this or write a symphony around the theme from ""Leave It To Beaver"" or ""The Jetsons,"" right? __EOS__  No, I haven't done that.  No.  But in my other symphony, ""Symphony No. 7,"" it's about human rights, and President Jimmy Carter narrated the universal declaration of human rights that was signed in 1948. And other symphonies, other works are looking at history, the plight of Cherokee through the Trail of Tears.  So I'm looking for things all the time that have maybe misunderstood meaning or maybe assumed meaning, and then try to put them into the concert hall for re-examination or sometimes just upliftment in general. __EOS__  Let's listen to another piece of music, if we could.  You have only one string quartet play, ""If I Had the World to Give.""   __EOS__  Now why did you choose to orchestrate it this way, Mr. Johnson? ",2
50500," Yeah.__EOS__ Guy, you know what? I'm going to give you full autonomy over everything that you do.__EOS__ OK. I take it.__EOS__ I'm going to talk to you, every single day, about how important what you do is each day, contributes to this beloved, public radio network...",3
50501," And Lake, you work with two actors from this series, in your movie. You have Rob Corddry in it, who is the creator of ""Children's Hospital,"" and Ken Marino, who is one of the stars.__EOS__ Yes. And it needs to be said that, you know, ""Children's Hospital"" is in its fifth season. It's now on Adult Swim and we also just got - we won an Emmy last year and we got nominated again this year. So we're really proud because it's a little - it's sort of this mini comedy family that we've been - we've taken this little web series that was a - that was actually the pilot for the web series which was five minute episodes.__EOS__ Right. Right.__EOS__ And then it upgraded itself to Adult Swim at 11 minute episodes. So...",1
50502,"  You write about how you imagined being a concert pianist at one      point.  You tried it a bit, and had bigger dreams and thought you should      have bigger dreams.  But then how did you come to terms with what you do      and come to like it? __EOS__  It took several years for me to come to terms with that.      There's a chapter in the book where I describe the voice of doom, this      voice that--I suppose all of us have a voice of doom living in our brain      somewhere. But the voice of doom for me was very present when I was in a      concert situation, and I don't know.  I just felt like I wasn't good      enough to be doing that kind of work and that--then I could play in a      bar, and yeah, that that would be an acceptable compromise.  And then      after a while, I realized it really--it's a wonderful, worthwhile thing      to do.  I realized that it took a lot of pressure off me not to have to      perform, just to be able to be in the background and watch what was going      on around me, that I didn't have to be the show anymore, that I could      allow my audience to be the show for me. __EOS__  So give us your view, all those people out there eating peanuts      and drinking their drink.  What do you look for when--do you scope the      crowd when you sit down to start out a night? __EOS__  Yeah.  Actually in the really good places it's smoked      almonds, it's not peanuts.  The bad places have the pretzel nubs.  One of      the things I always try to remember--I have a connection with Fred Rogers      of ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.""  My father was the percussionist on that      show for 35 years, sort of a world's record music gig.  But I got to know      Fred very well over those years, and one of the things he always said to      me is, `You never know who's listening.  It may seem like you're playing      in a roomful of noisy, talking people, but there's always someone      somewhere who's listening.'  I took that very seriously and I considered      it my job to play for that one person. And I also realized that sometimes      the one person who's listening was me, you know?  And that's--getting      back to your original question of how I came to terms with what it is      that I do, I realized that it's a really nice thing to be able to play      for myself, actually; a great way to make a living. ",2
50503," I wanted to write a fresh solo tune for this record. And so, as I often do, I made up a story that I could write the song from. And the story went like this - it went - this was during World War I and Private Mulvaney was in the Irish forces.__EOS__ And he had his little flat metal had on. And he's out there and, you know, he's in the trenches and so he's going to war. He gets in the middle of the war, he's being shot at. Maybe he gets hit, maybe he's sent home, you know, but in the end, he prevails. And he comes out of it and he's, you know, he's fine and in the end of the war, he comes home jubilant and goes to the pub.__EOS__ Rob, what were the recording sessions like? I mean, did it feel normal or were they fraught with meaning?__EOS__ It was fraught with meaning, you know, for me because Mike's the guy that got me into playing. And Jerry's been such a huge influence on me my whole life, you know? So it was exciting, but, you know, once we started playing, it just felt so good. And it just - everybody sort of did a different job and - just to make it sound complete. And it was just a real musical conversation.",2
50504," Well, I think that many of them, including the fact that I was -in many of the direst episodes of my childhood - saved by imagination, saved by magic, because I believe that magic and imagination create a spiritual reality. And in my opinion, a spiritual reality, that is as strong as a religion because they give you strength in times of trouble. And they give you a sense of another dimension other than just the material world. So I really experienced many of that type of passages. __EOS__ Magic, you say, in your childhood - and imagination. Was there a moment when you stopped believing in magic? __EOS__ No, no, no, but I actually think that - I jokingly say that I've spent 32 years trying to recuperate from my first 10. __EOS__ Because it really - is not the magic that ceased, but actually once you become a teenager, you start getting sort of a grasp - a better grasp, on the real world on how to deal with it. And the magic has never evaporated from my life because I do believe in things that have nicer-sounding names like synchronicity, for example, and the Unicist theory and so on an so forth. But ultimately, it's still magic. ",3
50505," Bankers, industrialists, government advisers - all hobnobbing at one of the country's most exclusive resorts. And right next door - right next door - a post-apocalyptic bunker to guard America's lawmakers, a place you'd go after a nuclear attack. __EOS__ Why is there a 7,000-foot landing strip for a town of 3,000 people? Well, that's so the government could fly their people in here in case of war, and go to the bunker that's under the Greenbrier. __EOS__ But as the historian, as the guy who had to answer questions about the history of this place, you must have been asked about it. People must have asked you  What do you know about this thing? __EOS__ And I said  No such thing. ",3
50506," You can find Sylvia trolling museum stores.__EOS__ That's right. Keep your eyes open next time you're there.__EOS__ If you see this perky woman, you know, a deep-sea diver looking for interesting new underwater stuff, that'll be Sylvia Earle and...__EOS__ Yeah. Or at the bottom of the sea.",3
50507,"   To the waters that day he was baptized in the usual way...__EOS__ It is, for me, hands down, the most heartbreaking moment in cinema. I've watched it hundreds of times. And it's a big part of why I wanted to make movies. I mean, I still get chills even when I describe the scene, but I remember what it was like to sit there alone, you know, watching this VHS tape on an 18-inch color TV and what happened on that small screen. It was the kind of emotional reaction that I only hope that one day I can sort of evoke out of an audience.__EOS__   ...on the wings of a dove.__EOS__  Baby, you're the only dream I've ever had that's come true...",1
50508," A lot of the ways in which you speak about Bach and his keyboard music sounds like you could be talking about a jazz composer or a jazz pianist. There's a hint here of the jazz vocabulary. __EOS__ Yeah, I think I've actually been very influenced by jazz musicians. And I think that the classical music world could use a little bit more of that way of thinking about things. __EOS__ So if somebody says, but is this what Bach had in mind when he wrote this music, I guess your first question is, well, maybe the notation doesn't tell us exactly what he had in mind when he was playing it, but you're also open to expanding a bit on what he had in mind. __EOS__ You know, the thing is that the older that I've gotten, I've been thinking that it's less important what Bach had in mind or what any composer had in mind because I'm living in a completely different time than Bach. ",2
50509," Well, I mean, I was lucky enough to grow up before there was - were any, at least in our neighborhood, any strip malls or any development at all. And so every day, I'd get home from school and get on my bike, and I'd just ride really a mile or two out and be right on the edge of the Everglades. And it was the best childhood imaginable.__EOS__ So, you know, your journalistic career covers a period in which Florida has been - I don't want to use the term invaded, but, you know, it is a state that is, you know, certainly at times of year, so full of tourists and retirees. Have you sort of - have you reconciled yourself to outsiders and their role in the state?__EOS__ Well, I mean you use the word invaded, I think is too mild. I use the word trampled, stampeded is what I usually use. Yeah. I mean, the population since I was born in 1953, the population has more than quintupled in the state. And that - and try to imagine any place absorbing that kind of population change and the transformation that you would watch if you lived here.

It's intermission in a minute, so you better get with it. Roll with me, Henry. You better roll it while the rolling is on. Roll on, roll on, roll on...__EOS__ Now, after you recorded this, Georgia Gibbs did a cover recording of this called ""Dance with Me, Henry.""",2
50511," But, like I said, this guy, he saved my life. When they wheeled me into the emergency room, he's giving orders to everybody else, and he doesn't say a word to me. And I wanted to ask him about a million questions about what I can expect, and he gets right in my face and says, look you're going to walk again. I deal with people that never are gonna walk again, just do what I tell you. And that was it, that set the tone for the whole relationship with this guy. __EOS__ Well… __EOS__ I'd like to hang up and get my, your comments on the air, but thanks for letting me let that out. __EOS__ Okay, Kevin, thanks very much.

50514," And they prefer to break it apart and, well, let's just see what comes out. Let's play with it. And sometimes, we circle back to what we have in the script. Other times, we tossed it out. __EOS__ This is about, of course, an odd kind of love triangle, in a way, in which you're the fulcrum. You have this relationship with John C. Reilly, but you have this very, very close relationship with your son, played by Jonah Hill - who I guess is 21, right, in the script. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And, you know, it's a relationship that's so close, it could be regarded as unhealthy. How did you get a feel for that relationship, making it real? ",1
50515," Again, is this kind of like the fault of consumers who - you know, we want tomatoes in the winter, and this is the price that we pay for getting them? __EOS__ It's the price we pay for insisting we have food out of season and not local. I mean, we foodies and people in the sustainable food movement, you know, we chant these sort of mantras  local, seasonable, organic, fair-trade, sustainable. And they almost become meaningless because they're said so often, and you see them in so many places. If you strip all those away, you know, they do mean something, and what they mean is that you end up with something like a Florida tomato in the winter which is tasteless. __EOS__ Well, if you're just joining us, my guest is Barry Estabrook, and he's the author of the new book ""Tomatoland  How Modern Industrial Agriculture Destroyed Our Most Alluring Fruit."" He writes the blog Politics of the Plate, which won a James Beard Award this year. Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more about tomatoes.

50517," I could have done a lot of cities. And, in fact, I considered different cities around the world, because Karachi is an example of something that's happening all around the world. There's been an incredible growth of urban areas since the end of World War II, even in the United States. Los Angeles is more than three times larger than it was - metro Los Angeles. Houston is six times larger. Istanbul is 10 times larger. Rio de Janeiro, we could go around the world like this. __EOS__ Now, let's just put this into some context. If you look back at the time that the Great Partition took place in 1947, Karachi was a city of about 400,000 people. It was a colonial port city. It's now more than 13 million people, exponential growth, which is I guess why you called the book ""Instant City."" Did the original framers have any idea what this city would become? __EOS__ I don't think that the people who founded Pakistan in 1947 had any idea. The guy who founded Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was picking his hometown. He predicted it would have a great future. He could not have predicted this. This is a port city. It's an industrial city. It is crowded. It is polluted. There are red streams going down the streets that people say are pollution from tanneries. There's raw sewage going into the harbor. But at the same time, it's a city full of incredible life and incredible improvisation. __EOS__ And it's interesting because you make the case in your book that Karachi, as it becomes a less diverse place, often becomes a more dangerous place. And that's ironic, that's not what you would expect. ",0
50518," And you have adventures on the road, don't you? One of the odd things about going on a national tour and going on for days and days and days and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks is reality tends to warp a little bit? __EOS__ Yeah. Hopefully. __EOS__ Isn't that the point? __EOS__ I think that's part of the point. But nevertheless, I think your commercial connections might think the point is to sell lots of records. ",2
50519," Did I print it out? I think I did. __EOS__ Today has already happened? __EOS__ Yeah, it's up there. It is finished. See if I got it for you. __EOS__ Just tell us the title of what we're suppose to do today. ",0

I just described that one so good that I want some myself.__EOS__ Me two.__EOS__ Could I ask you to tell - this is kind of a random story, but this funny story I read about - you had kind of an interesting introduction playing the electric vibes.

50521," I think that most people now at least know that mental health issues are - if they don't totally believe in it, they at least partially know that there's something out there that they should at least consider as, you know, causal. All right, and I'm trying to be cautious as I say these things because I know that there's a kind of wide variety of thought about mental illness. __EOS__ But the youngest child was 5 years old. __EOS__ Good. I was going to - I'm definitely going to try to get to that. So I was starting there because people kind of recognize that that one can actually really happen, because with the baby being delivered, now the hormonal levels change, the baby is gone, there's a combination of hormonal and neurotransmitter changes, but also social changes, right? So the attention that the mom was getting before as she's pregnant, everyone's, oh, you look so beautiful. You look great. When's the baby coming? __EOS__ As a mental health professional, Dr. Williams, are there ways in which you think that society could better support people who are in these circumstances? Because as we all pointed out, there's just a lot of things going on with this family - extreme poverty, not a lot of, you know, emotional resources, financial resources. But what do you think - what would you like  -if there's one thing you could do differently, you think would make a difference, what would it be? ",3
50522," Yeah. We were talking on the phone and we were writing letters. And I was just like, I got to go back and see this girl. I haven't seen her since the summer before and I think it was around spring of '91 and then I had to see her again. So we had this mini tour. It was like five shows that we had to drive all the way out to the Midwest. We played in Beloit, Wisconsin, Sioux Falls, and then we played in Minneapolis and we played in Mankato. __EOS__ Dumpster. Sounds very romantic. __EOS__ Yeah. Well, you know. __EOS__ And so you were sending real letters to each other, not emails. ",2

It comes off the page. She's very clever. She's deceitful. __EOS__ Mary Surratt even met privately with the assassin, John Wilkes Booth. __EOS__ When Booth went to Mary Surratt's boarding house on the afternoon of April 14th, he had already decided he would attempt to kill Lincoln that night.

No, I said it, you know, in a club in London in front of maybe 2000 people, 1500, 2000 people and just being in London during that whole time before the war, they always grouped Americans together. Like we all thought the way that the president thought. Yeah, I felt like I just wanted to let those people know just because we're Americans and especially from Texas and play country music, you can't put us in that category. I didn't want them thinking that we believed in that war when we didn't. __EOS__ Emily and Martie when you heard Natalie say that on stage what were you thinking? __EOS__ I had no reaction at all and I actually had to be reminded about what she said. Emily, you can tell. __EOS__ I felt like this rush of heat from the tip of my head to the tips of my toes. And not because I didn't agree with her wholeheartedly. I was just like, oh, shit. I knew it held some weight - oh, sorry, I can't say that on the air. ",2
50526,"  He was the drummer with the band?  Did you know that he could sing? __EOS__  A big baritone.  No, not really.  His voice just stood out, you know, amongst the other voices, and it just grabs your ear, mine anyway. __EOS__  Plus, Harold Melvin knew that he could sing, you know.  Harold was really the architect of that group, of the Blue Notes.  He'd been in The Blue Notes since in the late '50s, and so that's why eventually, what we decided to do is call it Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes because The Blue Notes kept changing.  But Harold Melvin remained there all the time and then Teddy Pendergrass came along. __EOS__  His voice roared. ",2
50527,"  ...so I'm going to let you handle the question next, 'cause you,      in a sense, might be closest to being a Brazilian, if not a Brazilian      girl.  One does have something to do with the other... __EOS__  Well, you know what?  Like, for      example, Sting, Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland were not policemen. __EOS__   Yeah.  All right. __EOS__  Neither the Rolling Stones are actual rocks.  They're human      beings. ",2

50529," I describe the metamorphosis like she talks to herself, and she says, you're just a little girl. You're stuck in a harbor waiting for him. Be a captain yourself and become a woman and kill this little girl. __EOS__ So I take this little voice, that's a distraught, little ironical, cheeky little girl's voice, and then at the end use a more operatic voice. And a friend of mine said, oh, it's funny, at the end you use this operatic voice like you've conformed into a woman. __EOS__ This song is called Senza because I basically reproduce with my voice a senza, the instrument, a senza pattern. __EOS__ It's an African instrument with little metal pieces, and you just use your fingers and trigger these piece of metal.

50530," You write in the book that when you were in the D.A.'s office in New York, that, sure, you know, you were on one side and the defense attorneys were on another, but you were friends and what you agreed on was the law and that the law should be followed. And you took opposite sides but the foundation was the law.__EOS__ Well, what's very interesting is that those people read our opinions which can be, at moments, rather animated. An animated exchange in writing among the justices. And many people who read our opinions think we have to be at each other's necks constantly. It's interesting we're not. When we're talking about cases at our conference it's generally a conversation. It's really a talk about what our perspectives are and why we have reached the conclusions we've reached.__EOS__ Because you think it's best to not discuss decisions that you've voted on or decisions that have been or will be before your court. We have stayed away from that territory. Do you think if you ever step down from the bench that you would write a book and discuss those things? Or do you think it will be forever off limits to you?__EOS__ I have no idea. You know, my colleague Justice Steven who's left the bench, has been writing prolifically about the issues that were important to him while he was a justice.",0

50532," Yes, because you're kind of a drag queen in it. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And you have this real, like, romantic view of the world. You have a very romantic sensibility, and even though you're in prison, you're wearing this, like, flowered robe, and you've put a towel on your head as a turban, and because Raul Julia is in such pain  he's been tortured, he's bleeding  you're trying to divert him and entertain him by telling the story of a film that you saw that you think is a really, like, thrilling and romantic film, and you're kind of doing it as if you're narrating the film. You're telling him the whole story of the film, and he kind of figures out that it's a film, it's a Nazi propaganda film, but you don't realize that. __EOS__ But I didn't get that, but I interpret it as romantic sentimentalism.

50535," Part of this is to shift the balance more toward the local communities and part of it was just for the interest of the poems themselves.__EOS__ One poem was written by a young woman only identified as Linda.__EOS__ We're all a little nervous. Mrs. Miles' 25-year-old son, Robert, Jr., is stationed out in the yard with a gun. Yes, the movement is still non- violent, but every farmer, white and black, in the Delta has a gun. Mr. Miles has seven, all loaded. Last night while I was eating a peanut butter sandwich in the kitchen and talking to the other white girl staying here, two shots whizzed right by the kitchen window. I could even see a flash of light from the gun. Since last Saturday night when the Miles' house was bombed with a teargas grenade, several other negroes in town had received bomb threats.__EOS__ What most people forget besides the palpable fear that community activists and volunteers face daily, says Julian Bond, is that most of the people who went down were...",0

50537," Since you started acting when you so young, when you were a child and you were doing commercials, was there ever a period where you thought  That's not me anymore. It's not really what I want - and you broke away from that and tried to do something completely different.__EOS__ You know, I've definitely gone through phases in my life where I stopped and had to think, okay. What do I want to be doing differently? And I loved doing the ""Spider-Mans,"" because it always gave me a bookmark for what was coming up every couple of years, and that was very comforting to have, like, those three movies, to always know you were going back to that.__EOS__ Well, Kirsten Dunst, thank you so much for talking with us.__EOS__ Thank you.",1
50538," It's not especially useful information about the Siegels, but it is a statistical breakdown. __EOS__ The thing that we're trying to do is to take the systematic knowledge that's been accumulated and be able to answer questions based on that systematic knowledge. For example, if you enter a first name, you might find something that is perhaps more immediately interesting. __EOS__ Now, but I saw your online demonstration of putting in two names and you get a comparison. Just enter John and enter Paul, you don't get a pontiff in the end, you get a comparison between the names John and Paul. __EOS__ Right. ",3

50540," So tell me something that you read in Little Edie's journals that made you comprehend her a little bit better or that surprised you about her. __EOS__ Well, her hair loss was something that really ate her alive. When she was younger, she went through a spell of alopecia that she didn't think she was going to recover from, but she did. And she was a very beautiful young woman who was, you know, fashionable and a model and had all this potential and promise. And you know, there's a line in the film, they did call her the golden girl. __EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Drew Barrymore, and she's starring in the new HBO movie ""Grey Gardens,"" which premieres Saturday night. __EOS__ Yes. ",3
50541," Because right now, the Central Bank doesn't have that authority. __EOS__ Absolutely right. The Central Bank actually can't issue debt. It can issue money, of course, and that's part of the problem. They all share the same courtesy, but they don't share any kind of definite fiscal authority. And if you're going to stay together, you need to make the same kind of decision the United States made in 1787 to have a fiscal union. __EOS__ So when we talk about this potential fix, this creation of a ministry of finance, what's in it for countries in the eurozone who are financially stable? What's in it for France and Germany? __EOS__ That's a great question. I think, ultimately, the decision comes down to them because they have the fiscal firepower. They have the ability to raise tax revenue, and they have the ability to just cede some of that revenue owed to this unified ministry. And the question is, do they want to go back to a more fractious Europe, a Europe that had a lot of conflict, a Europe that did not trade as much, and I don't think they do. I think the French and the Germans, in particular, have convinced themselves correctly that working together and making Europe more unified creates a basis for prosperity and for peace. ",3

50543," It's a wonderful story. The one flock that was known was flying from Texas to somewhere unknown in Canada, and each year when they came back, there were fewer until they were reduced to no more than 27 individuals. And then finally, luckily, their breeding place was discovered, and it was decided to do a captive-breeding program, but the problem was if something like bird flu hit that flock, it would be finished. __EOS__ You got to fly and watched it. __EOS__ It was one of the most amazing experiences. It's like being a bird because you're out there in the air and looking down at these beautiful birds. These are the adolescents, still with some golden, cinnamon feathers, and it's been very successful. __EOS__ I was struck by another example you write about in the book, the American burying beetle, and you write that it's easy for most people to sort of want to save cute and cuddly animals like pandas or snow leopards, but this beetle is also vital.

He shares his messy Brooklyn loft with the Yellow Dogs, another band from Iran. Beds are scattered on the floor, a bag of basmati rice hangs from the ceiling, and a gigantic, half-finished bottle of Carlo Rossi collects dust on a shelf. __EOS__ I hardly have any money, but I've never been happier in my life, either. Because if we go back home, we'll probably get arrested, and that won't do any good to anyone. But the fear of the landlord kicking you out is something parallel, too. __EOS__  I'm at the mercy of the waves, where they rouse is where I'll stay. Time will let me down.

50545," How Crime Went Online and the Cops Followed."" Well, Nate Anderson, welcome to FRESH AIR. Early in this book, you describe an attempt to establish an Internet haven.__EOS__ So back in the 1990s and the early years of the 2000s, one of the great dreams of people associated with the Internet was this idea that this new invention, these new technologies that were now global, had basically done away with the old national political boundaries. And you see this most remarkably with the case of Sealand, which was this rusting fort in the North Sea a few miles off the coast of the United Kingdom in which some Americans went over there, brought some computers, got an Internet link established from out there, you know, in the water on this platform, and decided to offer hosting services to anyone in the world.__EOS__ Now, I want you to describe this. I mean people don't picture a fort being out in the middle of the ocean. Describe this place. It was called Fort Roughs, right, built, what, for World War II?__EOS__ Roughs Tower, yes, it was built in World War II as a gunnery platform that was trying to take out Luftwaffe bombers coming in during the battle of Britain. And it was essentially a giant platform that stood out of the water on huge legs. Up on top the guns would go. There was a small sort of office, house place. But the men lived in the legs themselves, which were hollowed out, and as you can imagine were windowless and sometimes below the water line.",0

I just -- I wrote it down on the program and I went home and I just put it right in the song. __EOS__ Well, great artist borrow. __EOS__ Great artist steal. __EOS__ Great artist steal, that's right. Yes. Great artists don't borrow. They steal. That's right. ",2

It's considered the oldest, continuously operating independent black publisher in the country. Among its authors are Amiri Baraka, Gloria Naylor and Gwendolyn Brooks. We wanted to talk to Madhubuti about his vision, his mission and the future of the black press. __EOS__ Oh, thank you very much. I'm really happy to be with you. __EOS__ I'm glad you're here as well. So what was the mission of Third World Press, and why did you want to start a press for black writers? ",0

Why did Madison Avenue seem more ready for what you were doing?__EOS__ Well, my true goal was to be a recording artist. So I had made the rounds of all the record labels and got no place because they said, well, why don't you sing? Where's the guitar? They weren't looking for something new. They wanted, you know, what they already knew was a hit, and they wanted more of that. Advertising was different...__EOS__ ...because they were always high risk and always looking forward, always wanted to be, you know, at the forefront. So I had a much better reception there. Even though they didn't understand what I was doing, that wasn't an obstacle. It was even an advantage because it meant that it was something new and different, new and different. It was good.__EOS__ When I look at some of the videos of you at the console, one thing that's consistent then and consistent now is you seem almost to be floating. You know, there's no question that this person is in a kind of communion with the creative process.",2
50550," Thank you. You know, for independent films, I feel like I'm mostly offered serious roles, and you know, for other movies, it's lighter roles, and I think they're both  you know what? They're both fulfilling, to be honest with you. __EOS__ What makes a role good to you? __EOS__ Well, if there are some layers to it to explore, that it's not just, you know, a mean person or, you know, like in ""Paper Man,"" for example, I liked  that marriage was sort of complicated. So, you know, it's a writer with writer's block, and he's married to a successful vascular surgeon  that's what I played  and I liked that it wasn't just, you know, she's disappointed in who he turned out to be, and so that's, you know, the couple's identity is disappointing. __EOS__ Alex in Tallahassee writes  You were so great as Lucia in ""The Opposite of Sex."" What was it like to play such a serious and angst-ridden character, a stark contrast to your character on friends? Can you tell about what drew you to that role? ",1

My second day at McKee, a boy asked question that sends me into the past      and colors the way that I teach for the next 30 years. __EOS__  You did hit upon strategies that at least one nasty administrator      called pedagogical paydirt.  I mean, you did work to connect with him.      Will you tell us how? ",0
50553," Why should it work? Why does that work? And then it brings us back to the microbiome and the idea that there's a choreography, there's a normal developmental cycle of the microbiome from birth over the first few years of life. Especially the first three years appear to be the most important.__EOS__ Does that have consequence? And our studies in mice show that it does have consequences.__EOS__ You mentioned that the microbiome is developed during the first three years of life. And there's something you write about in the book that just, I hadn't heard this before, I found it so interesting, that when the baby passes through the birth canal that it develops some of its microbiome. I want you explain that.__EOS__ So as far as we know, when the baby is inside the womb, it is apparently sterile. There are some people who actually question this, too, but the big moment of truth is when the membranes rupture, the water breaks, and the baby starts coming out. And that's where they first get exposed to the bacteria of the world.",0

Terry spoke with Olson when the book was first published, last March.__EOS__ I had written a couple of books before this book, about Britain during the early years of World War II and about how it stood alone against Hitler. And the U.S. was always kind of an off-scene participant. You know, it was waiting to find out what was going to happen to Britain. It was the only country that could possibly save the British, and yet it spent years debating about what to do.__EOS__ So your main focus is on President Roosevelt and Charles Lindbergh. FDR - OK, he's president of the United States, pretty obvious why you choose him. Lindbergh?__EOS__ Lindbergh, as it turns out, was the unofficial leader of the isolationist movement in the United States. The isolationists basically thought we should stay out of World War II - we should not get involved in that European war; that what we should do is to be ready to defend our own country, and that's all. And Lindbergh, he was not a formal leader of this movement, but because of his fame, you know, he really became the one that everybody looked to and the one that Franklin Roosevelt was most concerned about.",3

And I said yes, ma'am, and she came over and put her arms around me and said  God's got his hands on you. I still think of that, you know? __EOS__ You left home when you were about 18, and then how old were you when you actually went to Memphis? __EOS__ Well, I went to Memphis after I finished the Air Force in 1954. I lived on that farm until I went to the Air Force. I was in there four years, and when I came back, I got married and moved to Memphis, got an apartment, started trying to sell appliances at a place called Home Equipment Company.

It was a great head start in the profession when I finally joined the profession. But after working for him for a year, I decided I have to move on - I have to try this on my own. I have to be in a situation where I do have to audition, where I do have to win roles and compete. And I went without working for like two years. It was murder. And I auditioned for soap operas and commercials. I remember auditioning for Lays potato chips. And I never got the roles. I think they must have sensed my contempt. ",1

She always said, you know, when she got that big recording contract and became famous, she was going to have teeth put in. __EOS__ But that big recording contract never came through. Dalton was tall and beautiful and certainly looked like a star. But veteran bass player and producer Harvey Brooks says she wasn't interested in playing the music industry's games in an era when musicians had little other choice. __EOS__ Karen came from the backwoods of Oklahoma.

50561," Yes. That was Billy. He was the croochy. He was a really, really wonderful kind of a chivalric man.

His great-grandfather had come here from Czechoslovakia - what's now Czechoslovakia - to work in the mines, died in the mines. His grandfather died in the mines. His father started working at age 12 in the mines, got black lung, died in the mines. __EOS__ There's this great passage in your piece where he went through what you went through, what everybody who goes down there even once to go through, which is, can I take it. __EOS__ Hmm. Well, that certainly was my experience. And I really was just - you know, compared to these guys, really just a tourist. I mean, I spent over a period of several months going in and out of the mine. But the first thing they say to you is, you know, you're going to find out right away when you go under if you can take it or not, if you can handle it mentally, if you can handle the sort of, you know, claustrophobic conditions and just the notion of it, just the notion that you're 500 feet under the ground in a tiny, little tunnel headed into the earth for another, you know, five miles into another tunnel, you know, encased in an area where you can't even stand up - it's only five feet tall in this mine I was in.

He recognizes the energy and the attitude they have.__EOS__ By the way, we were brilliant.__EOS__ And he felt kind of a bit awkward saying that. And I said, yeah, Paul, you were.

And every song he picked for us to record - that we didn't record - he gave to Jerry and the Pacemakers, or they're Brian Epstein acts usually. And they all had hits with it. You know, so it wasn't like he was picking bad stuff, but we were determined only to do our music. You know, Lennon and McCartney. __EOS__ Right. You can tell you're evolving. __EOS__ Yeah.

We were talking about needing let's say an online Web site or a wiki or something just to plan on all the weekends. __EOS__ Tell me what you can about the wedding that you've planned, where it will be and who's going to be there? ",3
50569," The Final Days of LCD Soundsystem."" Today, we're going to listen to Terry's 2010 interview with the band's leader, James Murphy. At times, LCD Soundsystem was really just Murphy using instruments, electronics and overdubbing. LCD Soundsystem played dance music, and Murphy was once a club DJ. But the lyrics of his songs were often ironic and funny, and the music that inspired him went way beyond dance music, appealing to a broader set of fans who wouldn't necessarily think of themselves as being into that sound.__EOS__  Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls. Drunk girls cause a couple of heart attacks. Drunk girls are unusually mild. Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles. Drunk girls are boringly wild.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ And your record label was called, or is still called - was called, is called, DFA.",3
50570," Well, I only did one of those things but my arm was sure tired after watching this video. I might have preferred writing on the blackboard to watching nearly six hours of this kind of tedium, which is why it cried out for a film review. __EOS__ Well, I take it you would not recommended ""Take Home Traffic School"" for date night. __EOS__ No, not unless you absolutely have to. Although I remember in school, when we watched these filmstrips and these educational videos - and I think the boys were sucked in by the term strip - that there was a good deal of making out going in the back of the room, a lot of snogging while the teacher was fusing with the equipment. __EOS__ You went to a much more exciting schools than I did. ",3
50571," Well, of course, we're mentioning Shaquille O'Neal, one of the greatest players in NBA history, toward the twilight of his career, he's going to be teammate with LeBron James in the Cleveland Cavaliers next year. And of course, many basketball fans in our audience also know that at the end of this season, LeBron James' contract runs out and he is eligible to become a free agent. __EOS__ No. Now, first of all, thank you. That was awesome to know that you have, you know, people like that that really respect the way you play the game of basketball and the way you approach the game of basketball. I think this is going to be a tough decision, honestly, for myself after the end of this year. __EOS__ Let's get one last caller in. This is Brad. Brad with us Medina, in Ohio. __EOS__ Yeah, sir. Thanks for taking my call. LeBron, my son graduated from Saint V  the year behind you. You used to call him the drawing man because he's designed a lot of the tattoos for the guys on the basketball squad - the Korean Boy, I don't know if you remember him. But in any event, my question is, I see a lot of you about town, now with some of your friends from the basketball team. And I wonder if you addressed that in your book, of how they helped ground you, even still today. I'll wait for my answer off the line. Thank you. ",0
50572," No. It was primarily my dive buddy that did the bulk of it - Jim Clark. He's the guy that started Netscape, Silicon Graphics and WebMD. He's been my dive buddy for over 10 years. And we, you know, we wanted to make a film that would basically give the oceans a voice. And he's the main backer. There's another friend of mine that put up the money for the P&A, the prints and advertising. And I have my son's college fund invested in this, too. __EOS__ I'm assuming it paid itself back then. __EOS__ Why would you do that? It is the film business. We're going to lose money on this. __EOS__ You're going to lose money on this. This is a film that's played all over this country, at least, in first-run theaters and now it's out on DVD and doing pretty well. ",1
50573," We're speaking with Jack Clark. He is a cab driver and novelist. His book is called Nobodys Angel. __EOS__ If youre just joining us, we're speaking with Jack Clark. He drives a cab and writes in the city of Chicago, and he has a book out now called Nobodys Angel. __EOS__ No, I was a writer first. My first published story was in 75 and like I said, I didnt start driving until either 77 or 78. I actually quit a staff job at the Chicago Reader and went to Flash Cab. __EOS__ Chicago Reader - it's a weekly, right? ",0
50574," Wilbert Rideau will be back in the second half of the show. His new memoir is called ""In the Place of Justice."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ And it was the publication for and about lifers at the prison. And when that magazine was very successful, you got your place on The Angolite. ",0
50575," FEMAtized to me is feeling that you get that, okay, am I going to be put out, you know, where do I go, it's really disheartening because I was a New Orleans Public School teacher and they just stabbed us in the back. __EOS__ You were all fired. __EOS__ We were all fired, laid off, fired, no pink slips. I heard that we're going to get one, but you know, I just feel like I've spent 15 years of my life, you know, being a teacher, doing something that I love and all of sudden I'm no longer that and I didn't have any backup. It's just been horrible, you know, to say that you've given up 15 years of your life and then just stabbed in the back. __EOS__ And nowadays it's very commonly said that when New Orleans comes back to life, its school system should somehow be radically different and in no way resemble what it was before. That everything should be charter schools and newly organized. ",3
50576," Yeah. Again, another theme of the book, the one, perhaps, to pick up, I mean, early, for instance, Mary Shelley, the author of ""Frankenstein,"" wrote a later novel which involves flying a balloon from London to Scotland. But the very interesting connection is with Edgar Allan Poe who was reading - I mentioned earlier on - Charles Green, who flew through the night into Germany.__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ ...Jules Verne, his first science fiction novel, it's called ""Five Weeks in a Balloon,"" which is about three mad Brits flying across Africa, from east to west. And again, very exciting, crazy flying over a volcano and getting attacked by condors. When it's reviewed, it's so beautifully written that the French reviewers review it as a nonfiction book. So that, I say, it's very poor, is that relation between fiction and nonfiction in science.__EOS__ Yeah, yeah. Well, Richard Holmes, it's a wonderful book. I suggest that if you're looking for a holiday gift, this is a great book also. It's called ""Falling Upwards."" Lots of great stories in there. Lots of great anecdotes about flying. Thank you very much for taking time to be with us today and good luck with your book.",0
50577," Thank you. __EOS__ I surf hurricane swells, okay? And I've been surfing hurricane swells for over 30 years. But one thing that we noticed is when the water is cold in the Pacific, the upper level winds don't tear the tops of hurricanes off in the Atlantic, so we end up getting a lot more swells. In 1995, we had close to 90 days of waves running head high to triple overhead in Jersey because of the fact that we had a lot more storms. But - so, what we look for is colder than normal water in the Pacific so we have bigger waves here. And my question is, is the global warming that we're having now cause - because 90 percent of the air pollution was knocked off from the Clean Air Act in 1971, and if it was caused by the cleaner air, does that show that the carbon in the air actually causes global cooling? __EOS__ Well, let me just try to tackle that briefly. The Clean Air Act certainly did clean up some particles that actually thought to have a cooling effect namely sulfate aerosols. And so to some extent that may have unmasked the global warming trend caused by carbon dioxide. But that doesn't mean we should pollute more and global warming will go away. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. ",0
50578," Firoozeh Dumas, do you write current events? Obviously, sweeping through Iran and through Iranian American communities, as well. How does change - does change inspire you? Does change limit you? How does it work?__EOS__ You know, my writing always has to do with just regular, ordinary people. I never write about politics. I don't write about religion. And the reason for that is that I feel like every country in the Middle East gets, like, one soundbite in America.__EOS__ Some countries are still waiting.__EOS__ Yes, this is true, too. Well, there has to be a war, I think, to get that soundbite. But basically, you know, for me as a humorist, there's this huge element of surprise when people read my books, and they say I can't believe that I laughed out loud at a book written by Iranian woman.",0
50579," Rehearsing, you know, their sonnets over there and it's just crazy. It was really a weird experience for me. __EOS__ The Roots are from Philly and for a lot of rappers, like, the place they are from becomes, like, mythologized through their rap. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ What do you think you've done like to create a Philadelphia in your music? ",2
50580," Well, I think if you cede that to anybody else, you're making a mistake. You have to decide it for your own life, and you'll have to decide it in what you consume and how you perceive the world. I mean, there is not a national commission of phoniness detection. If there were, I would probably ask to be nominated, and I'm sure I would be kicked off. __EOS__ We wouldn't trust you, anyway. __EOS__ I am - nobody has so far in my life, believe me. It's - you know, there is no objective measure of phoniness, but I would say, like pornography, we all know it when we see it, as Potter Stewart, the Supreme Court justice, said. I mean, there is nobody in the world, when they're on hold with a... __EOS__ Large corporation and the recording says, please hold for Amalgamated... ",0
50581," Well, everything that we did was based around a cappella harmonies. That's what we wanted to be in the beginning. We sort of wanted to be an a cappella group, and so that was why we put five guys in the group. And when we were forming the group, there wasn't a boy band phenomenon.__EOS__ Justin Timberlake, speaking to Terry Gross in 2010. We'll continue their conversation after a break. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's 2010 interview with performer Justin Timberlake. He's just released his first solo album in seven years called ""The 20/20 Experience"" and has confirmed that before the year is out, he'll release a companion volume.__EOS__ You've talked a little bit about singing and learning to sing when you were young. What about dancing? Like, did you study dancing? Did you study with break dancers or with more traditional choreographers?",2
50582," ...Of equipment and now things can be done much easier, you know. My first album we recorded in a 4-channel studio and we'd mix the drums in one channel and all other instruments in another...__EOS__ ...All the singers crowded around one mic, yeah...__EOS__ ...Crowded around one mic and do a proper balance then. If you don't do it during the recording, you can't do anything better than that. So it compromised the sound but it was good for the era of that time. I remember we used to perform using a hundred watt amplifier in a stadium. But people were satisfied, it was OK. But you can't do that today, because the era of today, it needs more power.__EOS__ I've heard you say many times that where you come from you don't get to sing a song if you have nothing to say, that you need the message, and it's something you've obviously taken very seriously in your music...",3
50583," Alecia Moore, your father was a guitarist.__EOS__ He was. He is. My dad's a Vietnam vet, good old boy who can, you know, sing.  Big girls don't cry, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.__EOS__ And when did you first know maybe that you wouldn't be Pink, but that you could do this, you could have a life in music?__EOS__ I don't think I talked before the age of 8. I sang my sentences to the huge annoyance of my brother and family. There was never another idea in my head. I was always going to do this. People thought I was insane. But I always joke and say I signed up for this life before I got here because how can a little girl from Doylestown, Pennsylvania, be so sure when no one around her is doing that? Certain people just know what their life purpose is at a very young age, and I just knew.",2
50584," So, you didn't catch them in bed, you have no pictures, you have no letters... __EOS__ That's what I am saying, that I don't find any familiarity... __EOS__ So what was it that would lead a reasonable man to think that they were sleeping together? What do you see? __EOS__ My Lord, a woman cannot leave the house without the acceptance of the husband, or the husband knowing where she's going to. ",3
50585," Do you ever feel that the librettist gets the least credit in a musical? You know, in a musical you always hear so much more sometimes about the songwriters. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ You only know the composer. And I think one of the reasons we dont have more and better playwrights writing musicals is that everybody has a need for recognition, which is, by the way, what ""Gypsy"" is really about. And it is so frustrating not to get any recognition for what one has done in creating a musical that a lot of playwrights simply won't try. And you get the people write letters to the Times and the critics say oh yes, and then for two minutes they recognize the librettist and then they don't. It's simply a given. The reason I do it is I just love musical theater and I love writing them. I'm stuck. __EOS__ When you are writing the book for musical, do you have a sense in your mind of where the songs belong and what the transition into the song is going to be like? ",3
50586," I think so. I think what it actually helped me to do is to just be cool in front of a microphone and to learn how to take direction. You know, like, could you just do it in the hamina hamina way? And I would say yes, I can, you know? So that kind of confidence, and I guess it kind of started - you know how everyone gets kind of grossed out when they hear themselves on tape? I mean I'm sure you've heard it before; when you first hear yourself on tape, it's not wonderful. So I kind of...__EOS__ Oh, I was horrified.__EOS__ Yeah, exactly. It's horrifying. It's so odd, you know? But I guess I got, I was able to get over that when I was a kid because I heard my voice so often. I'm still not quite over it, but it did help.__EOS__ How did you end up, how did you start off playing drums in addition to singing?",2
50587," Okay. Maybe we need to explain the vegetable oil part. A musician who gained a following as a one-man act is currently on a national tour with 15 other performers driving from gig to gig in a van powered by veggie oil. __EOS__ Thanks for having me. __EOS__ After three weeks, do you miss your days as a solo act? __EOS__ I mean, at times. But, no. It's much more rewarding to play with humans than it is to play with sequencers. ",2
50588," It's incredible. I think the line she said you're not the man you used to be and he said neither is this guy is one of the coolest things I've ever heard anybody say in a song in my whole life. You know, you walk in on your wife in bed with somebody and say - and have the wit to say that even in the face of how terrible, terrible that situation would be.__EOS__ Yeah. Yeah, that's really good. Well, thanks for introducing me to that.__EOS__ Thank you.__EOS__ So I just want to get back to this thing we were talking about earlier which is, you know, sobriety. And I've gotten the impression through your songs and interviews that it's your wife who helped get you into rehab. And, you know, there's that point for everybody who finally has that turning point but many people don't ever get there. And for many people it takes years and years of false starts before they do. Why was - why did this time work? Why did it actually happen?",2
50589," Let's hear one of the tunes from the CD. This is a song of Allen Toussaint's called Who's Going to Help a Brother. __EOS__  We may seem happy, like everything's alright. From the outside looking in, everything's uptight. But deep down inside, we're covering up the pain. It's an old thing, it's a soul thing, but it's a real thing. Pray tell, what's going to happen to brother. Who's going to help a brother? __EOS__ Allen Toussaint, is that one of those tunes you'd forgotten? It sure sounds relevant after... __EOS__ Allen Toussaint, is that one of those tunes you had forgotten? It sure sounds relevant after Katrina. ",2
50590," ...it didn't fit me, my, whoever the personality was. So I said let's put a little something on my back, a little, fatten that up, gave me a little, you know hump on my back. __EOS__ And that balanced the breasts better, if you want to call them breasts. And then I said I'd like to have a shortened neck you know they, so they put some, they put some padding in my shoulders. But it was on the sides and it didn't work so we took that out. And then I had them put it right on top of my shoulders and that raised these breasts up under my chin, and so we, it was wonderful. __EOS__ We've been focusing on your comedic roles but you won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for a dramatic role in the movie ""The Last Picture Show,"" which is from 1971 - is that 1971? __EOS__ Mm-hmm. ",1
50591," With pleasure. Here are the 10 plagues. Everybody dip your fingers at home. Blood, frogs, lice, a maelstrom of beasts, pestilence, boils, and hail full of fire, locusts, a clotted darkness too thick to pass, a killing of the firstborn.__EOS__ That's some scary stuff. Hail full of fire? Not just darkness but a clotted darkness – that's C-L-O-T-T-E-D. So have you gone back to English translations? I should've brought one so I can compare it.__EOS__ Oh. This? I was going to say, you would make an excellent rabbinical student. You sort of picked out – as I said, it's a hyper-literal translation. There are a few chances I took in this translation and that was one of them because I thought about this section is for - it's for adults but it's also really for children.__EOS__ So you're saying this wasn't a literal translation; this was your understanding of it?",0
50592," Sure. Go ahead, please.__EOS__ I wasn't sure if it counted at first, but when I was younger, when I was about 14 - I'm 22 now - I got one of my first gaming systems. It was like online gaming, and there were headsets, and I sort of fell in with a regular group of friends, like two or three, four or five people who I would see during - not see, speak to nearly every day over the summer playing video games and whatnot. And I've actually kept up with a few of them until now. And I really agree with what your guest said about it being easier to open up to someone, because I really did feel a lot closer to these people than I did...__EOS__ And you've only met their avatars?__EOS__ Right, right. And sort of I feel like the other side of that, though, is that it's very easy to fall out of contact sometimes. And it was kind of sad, actually. I spoke to one of the members of that group who lives in California, after not having talk to anybody for a couple of months, and he was like, oh, my gosh, did you hear our friend Justin? He had been killed in a car accident, so - and I don't know. It - you know, it hurt.",0
50593,"   Flowers blooming, morning dew, and the beauty      seems to say it's a pleasure when you treasure all that's new and true      and gay. __EOS__  It's no mistake when an individual comes out from a group,      whether it be Luther or Lionel Richie or whatever.  You know, there's      just something special about certain individuals and it can't be denied      for long, you know.  They'll be in a member of a group; they'll be a      member of a duo or something like that; and the next thing you know,      they're a household word. And Luther was definitely one of those.  He was      our living legend. __EOS__   As we share our affair, talking in the glow of      love, oh. __EOS__  But with all the adulation and wealth that came with being the      world's best-loved contemporary R&B singer, Luther was not content.  He      wanted, but never achieved, a number-one hit on the pop charts. ",2
50594," And so I'm going to see The Who in Boston this week. You know, you write - that early on in your life, you wanted, with The Who, to make the kind of music that would become - I'm saying here now - anthemic. Your words are a part of people's lives, even more than the way we dress. Our music would give voice to what we all needed to express as a group, as a gang, as a fellowship, as a secret society, as subversives. I saw pop artists as near of the audience, developing ways to reflect and speak truth without fear. You know, and I was thinking, who did you think you were at the time? I mean, you were a young man writing that. But that's a big assignment.__EOS__ Well, I'm writing it - also in - with - in retrospect. I'm 19, looking back. I - who did I think I was? I definitely, in the early days of The Who, knew that I wanted, more than anything, more than being a performer, more than being a songwriter, more than providing any service for the audience, I wanted to be an artist. And I was teased about that. I was teased about that because it seemed pretentious to claim to be an artist when you're playing guitar in a silly rock band who smashed their guitars and wore jackets made of flags. So...__EOS__ ...nonetheless, you know, I wanted to operate as an artist. And as an artist, my brief was that I wanted to serve my audience, and my audience were the people in front of me. So that was the job. And so I thought I was doing that job. I thought I was actually doing - and it's interesting that being in a pop band in the '60s, for me, my role was not just entertaining. It was also slightly journalistic. You know, I would talk to people. I would find out what's going on in their heads. I would observe them very, very closely. I will try to find things about them that would enrich not only my craft, but that would touch them.__EOS__ Well, you're very welcome into the sorority and fraternity. Let's take another call here from Elizabeth. She's calling from Boise, Idaho.",2
50595," Oh, the TV show is with the Adam West you're talking about. __EOS__ The original Adam West TV show. __EOS__ Biff, bam, pow. __EOS__ Absolutely. And, of course, what was great about that, though, was I was six, seven years old when it came to England. So I didn't regard it in any way as camp or funny. ",0
50596," Oh, absolutely.__EOS__ And when you find out that this is part of the family life, you're not pleased, as you would imagine. And I just want to play a short clip from where you talked about this with your mom and your dad.__EOS__ What kind of life is that? I mean, it's...__EOS__ Well, yeah. Well...",1
50597," Well, documentaries are almost - you know, are notoriously strong at Sundance, and I saw a couple that I thought were especially interesting. One opened - was an opening-night film. They had three this year, which is sort of unusual, but one of them was called ""Restrepo"" by Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetherington, and Sebastian Junger, as you know, is the journalist who wrote ""A Perfect Storm."" __EOS__ All right, that's ""Restrepo,"" a film made by Sebastian Junger. Any other documentaries that you liked? __EOS__ The other film that I really loved was Davis Guggenheim's ""Waiting for Superman,"" which is about the sort of disaster of our public education system. And I think one of the amazing things about this film is that he followed five children who wind up in five various lotteries for charter schools. And by the time you get to the lottery, if you aren't a parent, you feel like a parent, and if you are a parent, you feel like these are your children. __EOS__ And Lisa, if you could just sum up the mood there at Sundance, because we've talked a lot on this program and elsewhere about how the major studios have dropped a lot of their independent divisions and that there isn't a lot of support out there these days for independent film, what's the mood there now? ",1
50598," So why did your parents send you to an evangelical camp? I realize your father at this point had turned against Islam and had turned against religion in general, I think, considered himself, you know, an atheist, and your mother I think, remained, you know, Muslim in name but not really active. But still, sending you to a Christian camp, that's a surprise.__EOS__ Well, you know, I went on my own accord. I mean as many children of immigrants will tell you, I mean my parents had thought that they had done their job right if I came home at the end of the day alive and in one piece.__EOS__ They were so busy trying to just make it in this new country, and frankly, the people that I hung out with, these kind of church-going Christian kids, were in the eyes of my parents good kids, and they were precisely the kinds of kids that my parents wanted me to hang out with.__EOS__ So did being part of this evangelical Christian group give you a sense of community, and was that really important to you as an immigrant from Iran, to feel like you were connected to a group in America?",0
50599," You write that this near magical God that people in the evangelical church that you studied believe in is an expression of what it is to be modern. What do you mean by that?__EOS__ The thing about modernity is that doubt is more available. Any Christian in this country knows that there are wise, good people who aren't Christians, and it just makes the question of whether God is real more salient, even if you never utter your own doubt. What this kind of magically real God does, a God that is so immediately present, a God that is having coffee with you across the breakfast table, even perhaps in front of his own ceramic cup of coffee, it enables you to understand - it forces you to experience God not as real in the way that tables and chairs are real, and not as fiction, but as somehow in between.__EOS__ So you're saying you see this personal relationship with God as  or as a response to a world in which doubt exists in a way that it didn't in previous centuries?__EOS__ Yes. There have been vivid experiences of God in previous times. I mean, the vividness of God rises and falls with, you know, different centuries. But I think in this particular time, this kind of God, it emphasizes mystery, it emphasizes paradox, it emphasizes practice rather than belief. It allows you to experience the contradictions of knowing God intimately but not being sure whether God really spoke to you about where you should go on vacation.",3
50600," We're talking to the members of the Jordan family. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. __EOS__ Uh, yeah. Of course. __EOS__ We're, well we have a great, you know, band of musicians; Mike Esenall and Harry Anderson and Simon Lott. So, Stephanie picks great tunes, so we get a chance to stretch out. What I mean, she really does, she picks some really interesting things to sing, so I enjoy it a lot. __EOS__ Yeah. ",2
50601," Correct. I mean something, for instance, like cobra venom. You'd say what on earth would a trainer be using cobra venom for. Well, what it does is it paralyzes that particular part of the leg and the horse cannot feel pain. Now unfortunately, according to the people we talked to who want a cleaner industry, cleaner more honest races, they do not have a test for that just yet.__EOS__ And there's also an aspect of experimental. I mean tests have come up positive from everything from Viagra to feed for pigs that somebody suspects has a steroidal affect that'll boost it up, cancer drugs, you know, there's a lot of these guys in the backstretch who, if somebody says this will make your horse run faster, they will give it a shot. And, you know, there's no test form and nobody really even knows if it works or not.__EOS__ And there's a fear among trainers, that if their competitors are using something that may or may not work - well, you know, I might be at a disadvantage, so they're going to use it too if they can get away with it. And I think that's driving, you know, a good part of the use of these improper drugs.__EOS__ You've written that the presence of slots casinos at racetracks have changed the economics of this. Let's just go over the basics here. The horseracing industry liked the idea of opening up slots at racetracks, because they would bring patrons and increase gambling. How has that affected the economics of races themselves?",3
50602," Hulu won't provide an exact view count for ""Strictly Sexual,"" but there are enough people watching to make Stevie Long a profit through commercials embedded with the movie. __EOS__ I'll give it to you in these rough terms. The film, the $100,000 film has made 10 times its money. __EOS__ Enough to fund Long's next independent film. __EOS__ It's a tragic tale. It's about people in the porn industry and the denial that goes on there. We've appropriately titled it ""Porn Star  The Ugly Life of a Beautiful Girl."" And I'd like to think a lot of people are going to click on that title. ",1
50603," Frazey Ford, you brought your guitar with you, and we don't always get to meet our artists in the studio. Sometimes they're in far-off places across the country. But you are here in Washington with me. Can you play something for us? __EOS__ Yeah, I'm going to play a song called ""If You're Going to Go."" __EOS__  If you gonna go, then do it. If you're gonna leave, then let me be 'cause I know that a person, well sometimes, just has to be free. __EOS__ That was just beautiful. ",2
50604," ...I think you don't need to pay  youd need it to pay your rent anymore. __EOS__ No. My rent is taken cared of. But I do love to write and I'm always getting assignments from people. Would I write an introduction for this book or a preface for that book, or a little filler story for this comic? And even though I don't have the time to do it, it's hard for me to say no, so I end up spending as much time on things that have nothing really to do with my normal work as I do with my own work. But somehow, I'm lucky, I get it all crowded in. __EOS__ Our guest is comics immortal Stan Lee. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. __EOS__ Hi. First, of course, let me get out of the way what a big fan I am. And I really appreciate all that Stan Lee has done for comics. I was wondering if, Stan, you've ever had a character that you created that didn't really do very well as some of your other characters, who you thought should've had a lot more exposure to everybody, you just don't feel they had a chance at success? ",0
50605," This is the beginning of the book ""Canada.""__EOS__ You take these people and you call them unlikely and you build up their character so that indeed this does seem exactly as you say. But you also write that as a novelist, that's kind of your job to draw us into unlikely things actually happening and having consequences.__EOS__ Right. I think it is my job. I have a theory - and I don't know if my colleagues would agree with this - that someplace at the heart of most compelling stories is something that doesn't make sense. What I mean is that here is a family - if you were flying over them in a balloon - would seem to be nuclear and regular, that they all love each other and they live under one roof, and the father is trying to earn a living and the mother teaches school. And the next thing you know, panic ensues, and they rob a bank. It's very interesting to me and dramatic and I thought worth a novel, at least.__EOS__ Richard Ford, I was struck by the fact that the charming southern born father, Bev Parsons - short for Beverly - he's been decorated in the Air Force, he sells cars, he looks good, he's handsome. And when he gets into trouble like this, it's a kind of financial panic that I'm thinking when you started writing the book, we might not have been able to imagine as readers as well as we can imagine it today.",0
50606, Prince would've loved it.__EOS__ That's one of my go to songs.__EOS__ Has Prince heard you do that?__EOS__ I'm not aware of his doing it. I assume if he had and disapproved I'd be dead by now. That's what I understand from the power of Prince. So either he hasn't heard it or he's heard it and liked it.,0
50607, I don't remember. __EOS__ I think we all decided to do it. __EOS__ Spontaneous. __EOS__ That was just like a musical. ,2
50608," ""Ice,"" is the name of the book, A Memoir of Gangster Life and Redemption - from South Central to Hollywood."" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. __EOS__ Oh, hi. Ice-T, what's up? This is awesome. I'm so - I can't believe you're on this program, but I just wanted to ask you. As, such an iconic figure of the creation of, you know, gangster rap and generally hip-hop, you know, in general, in the '80s and '90s, I was just wondering what do you think of the state of hip-hop today? I mean, is it on a decline or do you think it's better than ever? I just really like to hear your views on hip-hop today. __EOS__ I think it's gone pop, honestly. You know, I think that it's lacking the soul that, you know, the early hip-hop had, you know? Right now, we're living in a situation - I was just listening, earlier, to the people before I came on, the country is into turmoil, money is down, everybody has got problems, you know, we got a war going on, you got Obama, got a black president, you got all kinds of things happening, but the music doesn't reflect that. __EOS__ All right. Well, thank you. That's awesome man. I agree with you. ",0
50609," Wow. __EOS__ That's fascinating, Katherine. Well, congratulations. __EOS__ Absolutely. Take good care. __EOS__ Bye-bye. Here's an email from John in Mount Vernon, Iowa  The Masonic designation, AL, stands for anno legis - or legis - or year of the law, and refers to the legendary founding of the fraternity. There is nothing secret about it. And if your caller had looked at the cornerstone more closely, she would have seen that it was set in space - laid, in Masonic terms - by the Grand Lodge of her jurisdiction. A simple phone call to the Grand Lodge or, in fact, almost any Mason would have answered the question. So, again, when in doubt, call an expert. ",0
50610,"  Well, I knew it was going to be Patty's story, and I figured      if I could stay close to her and what is important to her, what her true      desires are, even from day to day, that I would be OK because her      emotions are just so wide, so high and so low at times, as a young      mother, as a wife who's separated from her love.  I knew that if I could      just stick close to her and write that and then let the reader feel      it--you know, sometimes you have to cut back very far, so that the reader      has a space to sort of feel what she's feeling rather than telling them.      I knew that I would be OK because I think as the book went on I found her      an absolutely fascinating character, and I hoped that the readers would      too. __EOS__  When you talk about cutting back like that, what do you mean? __EOS__  Well, instead of, you know, actually saying what her emotions      are or how she's feeling, you have to find ways to let her just      demonstrate or things that sort of--eh, this is... __EOS__  Yeah.  Yeah. ",0
50611," You are in our studios in Southern California. Did you ride your bike to the studios today? __EOS__ Actually, no. I didn't. I did try and ride a bike across Los Angeles once, and I think once only. __EOS__ Not an easy feat. __EOS__ No. ",0
50612," Yeah.__EOS__ So how much did you lose and what was the flood?__EOS__ Well, you know, I'd been carting crates of records, you know, to school and across the country and back and forth over the years. And then I moved into a house and had these things in a garage and there was a flood and I probably lost about 80 percent of my records. I really tried not to let it devastate me. And I put it back together for the most part, but it was a bit sad.__EOS__ Is there still a record that you're looking for that you lost, then?",2
50613," That's correct. On June 30th of 2008, we were at $712 million. __EOS__ So, your endowment has gone the way of many of the 401s of your faculty, I assume, and of the parents of your students, as well. __EOS__ Absolutely. And that's the other problem. Many students have parents who lost their jobs or are unable for one reason or another to pay tuition because they lost money in the market or elsewhere. Our commitment is to make sure that we do not send any student home who can't pay his bills right now. And we will do everything in our power to make that possible. __EOS__ Among Brandeis University's most generous supporters, if not the most -  I believe the most generous supporters of the university have been Carl and Ruth Shapiro who were thought to have lost more money than anyone else that they invested with Bernard Madoff. Their foundation and their personal investment combined, more than half a billion dollars. To what degree is this a Madoff problem that you're experiencing? ",3
50614," So what was that first confrontation?__EOS__ The White House and the administration had put forward legislation to amend the Neutrality Act so that Britain and France could in fact buy weapons from the U.S., and it was introduced. Members of the Congress, particularly in the Senate, put up a big, big fight to keep that from passing. It eventually did pass but there was still a lot of hesitancy on the part of members of Congress in terms of, you know, whether we should in fact help Britain and France.__EOS__ And then after that legislation there was the Lend-Lease Act. Would you describe the importance of that in kind of not only in helping Britain but also in setting the stage for us entering the war?__EOS__ The Lend-Lease Act was one of the most important pieces of legislation that was passed, you know, before we got into the war, and actually it was one of the most important wartime bills ever passed. Basically, the Lend-Lease helped us win World War II, and it was designed to allow the president, to allow Franklin Roosevelt, to lend or to lease equipment, planes, ships to whatever country he thought needed to have them.",3
50615," Mm hmm. Well, we'll try to get you out of that conundrum. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ Gazzi, thanks very much for the call, and good luck with your girlfriend. __EOS__ Okay, thanks so much. Hi Meagan! ",0
50616," Well, theres, it was quite a popular genre. In the early 60s in Mexico there were quite a few groups inspired by the arrival of Bill Haley who was down there avoiding income tax evasion. __EOS__ Wait, Bill Haley was in Mexico? __EOS__ Yeah. He moved to Mexico City for a while and inspired a whole scene in Mexico City and there were all these groups doing American rock 'n roll songs in Spanish. And they changed the lyrics sometimes drastically. Some were faithful translations, but a lot of them were just completely different. And it's wonderful. I love these records and I've been collecting them for a long time. And we've known for years we needed to do an entire album of Mexican rock 'n roll with Big Sandy and we finally got around to doing it this past year. __EOS__ A wise choice to have Big Sandy. ",2
50617," McConaughey's performance in ""Dallas Buyer's Club"" has earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. He also makes a notable appearance in the opening scene of Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" and is now starring in the HBO series ""True Detective,"" which is set in a remote area of Louisiana. McConaughey plays Detective Rut Cohle. He's prone to dark and enigmatic monologue, sometimes to the annoyance of his more straightforward partner played by Woody Harrelson.__EOS__  I think human consciousness is a misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware, nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law.__EOS__  That sounds god  awful, Rust.__EOS__  We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, a secretion of sensory experience and feeling, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody's nobody.",3
50618," OK. __EOS__ What are you going to play for us first?  __EOS__ I'd love to ""Underneath"" for you. __EOS__ OK. Let's hear it. This is ""Underneath."" This is from the new album by Alanis Morissette. The album is called ""Flavors of Entanglement."" Let's listen. ",2
50619," But Kalashnikov himself hasn't really received any money from making this oh-so-popular weapon. __EOS__ As a citizen of the Soviet Union, he did it for the glory of the Motherland and did not make one ruble off the whole thing. But he is getting his money now. He is trotted out to arms fairs. He's like a celebrity and he signs photographs and so forth and so on, because the Soviet Union would like to sell more weapons. And he also has started a line of vodka, which now will come to the United States next year. It's already in Europe and the Middle East. It's called General Kalashnikov's Vodka and it has a picture of him on the bottle. __EOS__ In your book, you say that the AK-47 changed the face of modern warfare as much as the atomic bomb did. Explain to me how the AK-47 did this as opposed to just guns or automatic weapons. __EOS__ As I mentioned, you know, we found a new kind of warfare after World War II called blitzkrieg. And now we have a different kind of war called asymmetric warfare. Because the United States is the only superpower left in the world, there's no more nuclear issues. And so as a result, the only kinds of wars that the United States will fight now is what's called a small war. And once you've bombed the place with all of your smart weapons, what's left except going house-to-house, as we see sometimes on television. And that's where the weapon shines. Anyone can have them. Anyone can own them. And that's what's changed warfare, is that anybody can be a soldier. ",3
50620," So they managed to bring car batteries in, get enough power to at least get the instruments working, and what did the readings tell them?__EOS__ They got some of the instruments working, and the most disturbing thing they discovered, and this by just after midnight on - a few hours after the tsunami, they discover that the pressure in the reactor is out of control. It's much, much, much too high.__EOS__ And where was the pressure coming from?__EOS__ The pressure - they didn't know, but they could only assume, and they rightly assumed, that the fuel rods within the reactor were overheating. And now when they overheat, the water that surrounds them turns into steam. So we have huge amounts of steam. They also feared that a chemical reaction was happening there creating huge amounts of hydrogen. Again, they turned out to be right about that.",3
50621," In your neighborhood?__EOS__ I have no license to be doing what I'm doing. You know, I didn't grow up in an all-black neighborhood or something. I'm not black myself. I grew up a Jew where there were no other Jews. But that's the only thing I can remember from my life is, like, in third grade a kid on the bus threw, like, pennies at my feet and said, you know, like, pick them up Jew. Like you're a cheap Jew or something like that. But it was so innocent, you know? I mean, it's a kid doing it. Of course I didn't have that perspective then, but at the same token, he became my little third grade boyfriend probably a month later.__EOS__ Really? Did you even get it then?__EOS__ Yeah I did. I was like yeah, Jews are cheap - ha, ha, ha. You know, I was raised in a place where there wasn't - you know, people weren't racist. I mean it was a time in, you know, the '80s or whatever where - in a world that was very white and there were no Jews, but I didn't feel threatened at all. So even when that happened I was just kind of like, that's weird, you know? I don't know. But you know, my dad grew up in a very different world, you know? He was beaten up and abused brutally, you know, for being Jewish.",3
50622," Is that important, especially to find a way to stand out as a new artist, making your way...__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ ...in this business?__EOS__ Yeah. For me, it was. You want people to recognize you instantly and you want people definitely to have an image of you when they hear your music. So, for me - yeah - it was important.",2
50623," Because they're taking work from me. But I love Louie. I think he's going to be major. I think he should be writing movies. He knows his craft. But it's really true, you do not leave a job. In our business, you do not quit. I told Deborah Norville once, who's a very good friend of mine, when they try to - you're holding on to the ladder. When they cut off your hands, hold on with your elbow.__EOS__ Did anyone ever give that advice to you?__EOS__ No one gave me any advice. Nobody ever thought I was going to amount to anything.__EOS__ I was the last one in my group to go through. I was in a group with George Carlin and Woody Allen and Barbra Streisand and Simon and Garfunkel and Bill Cosby. They all got through ahead of me, all got through ahead of me. Nobody said to me maybe you're too rough, you're too wild, you're too whatever. No one gave me any advice.",0
50624," Yeah?__EOS__ I read your book in '69 when I was a freshman baseball player, and then I went to a football camp at UC Santa Cruz before my senior year. And they put us through all these really rough football stuff, and I was learning about it. Well, we had a curfew and we were locked in our dorm, and outside our dorm window were these UC Santa Cruz co-eds skinny dipping in the pool. So we jumped out the window, and we went to join them. And all of a sudden, cops come from all directions in their cars and red lights were flashing, and we scrambled to put our pants on and we went back to find our dorm was locked.__EOS__ And the football coaches were furious, and they got us in this room at 1 o'clock in the morning.  They're chewing us out, telling us they're going to call our parents, and they're going to call our coaches and get us kicked off the high school football team and we're going to be sent on the Greyhound back. And we better pack our bags. And I leaned forward and I said, Jim Bouton wrote about the Yankees scrambling above the roof of the Shaw Hotel, looking through windows trying to find naked girls. And the coach looked at me and he stopped, he goes, you're probably the smartest guy that's ever attended here.__EOS__ So, they didn't kick us out, and they gave me a trophy. And on the way back on the bus, I found out that someone had mixed up my pants and put an expensive wristwatch in there. So, Jim, you are a great guy, and you saved a bunch of high school football players.",0
50625," Is this part of a preemptive strike, in a way? Did you figure that your profile is high enough now? __EOS__ And, frankly, you get some controversial positions. Do you figure that some people might put your business out in the street to discredit you so you might as well strike first? __EOS__ No. Most of these stories, again, if I could keep this stuff from my family and my friends for 20-plus years, I suspect that bloggers might have a difficult time trying to find it out. But it's not about hiding anything. If I were going to hide, I wouldn't be transparent. The reason for putting these failings out is not really about atonement or about a preemptive strike. I'm not about to announce that I'm running for high office or anything. __EOS__ Now, there's some, as I mentioned, there's some really painful episodes in this book, but I do want to start with something that I think might be a little easier, which is the cussing. You mentioned that some of your failings are things that many people did not know anything about, but your cussing was legendary. And I'd like to ask about why you think you started cussing and what made you stop. To me that's one of the, you know, poignant chapters of the book. Why did you start cussing and why did you stop cussing? ",0

50627," Again, the - I think, you know, one of the reasons why I went into classical music as maybe as opposed to other forms in music is there - for me, there was kind of an idealism of putting 100 percent of your energy into the music and the performance. __EOS__ All right. That makes total sense to me. That explains the whole thing, actually. I'm wondering how the other musicians reacted to your makeover, by the way. __EOS__ Mild mocking… __EOS__ …I think is probably the best way to put it. I think that… ",3
50628," Yeah, we went No. 82, which I didn't think we had a hope in hell, but we did. __EOS__ And it's just great, being from the States and never being able to play there, to be able to do something like that really meant a lot. And yeah, it was a good week. __EOS__  What's the use in my advice That you just turn down? Swaying to a serenade... __EOS__ The Boxer Rebellion first got together in London in 2001, while Nathan was there studying abroad. The band was soon signed to Poptones Records, which had also signed bands like Oasis and the Super Furry Animals and My Bloody Valentine. In 2005, Poptones and Mercury Records released the excellent ""Exits,"" the band's first full-length CD. Unfortunately, that very same week, Poptones folded. So, despite strong critical reviews, an album that looked like it might make some big waves sank with barely a ripple. ",2
50629," Well, I think it's substantial. I think the pressure from China is huge, which is why you have, you know, sort of bizarre countries where they've been settled  Bermuda. Bermuda was a country where the governor just wanted to do the Obama administration a favor. So they actually did that without the U.K.'s blessing.__EOS__ And none of the Uyghurs have been resettled in the U.S.?__EOS__ No. And, in fact, that has made it a really difficult to resettle them, because there were some that were going to be settled in the U.S. And when word leaked out, it became a huge political issue that there was great outcry, saying, you know, we're not going to have these men who have been declared the worst of the worst on our soil. And so what...__EOS__ You mean the outcry was in the U.S., not in China.",0
50630," Why wasn't he put on that list? Why? __EOS__ You know, I couldn't say for sure. I know that the first opera that he did called ""Troubled Island,"" was panned by the press. People just didn't - this was like in 1949, maybe - and people just did not know how to respond to an opera by a black man  i.e., you know, it sort of assaulted their preconceptions. __EOS__ That's the music of William Grant Still. Marc Smirnoff is the editor of the Oxford American magazine. The 11th annual music issue is on the newsstands now. __EOS__ Thank you for your questions, Guy. ",2
50631," Well, that is really an astonishing story. The picture is taken by Walker Evans, who is a famous photographer. And when it was taken, I was just six-years-old. But by the time I saw it, I was in my late 80s. And when I saw the picture, I was just astonished, really.__EOS__ A loving couple, their arms around each other, overlooking the water.__EOS__ Yes. Well, it looks like a very romantic couple, but it's much, much more than just romance.__EOS__ We may have buried the lead. It's your father in the picture.",0
50632," New York Times jazz critic Ben Ratliff says what makes Guillermo Klein's music strikingly original is its classical elements, from Bach-like fugues to minimalist repetition to a medieval technique of parceling out a melody out in a kind of round robin. __EOS__ This very old device called hocketing, which is where you have — let's say you have a row of trumpet players, and they're going to play a melody. Well, instead of all of them playing the same melody at the same time, each one of them, in sequence, will play a single note of that melody. So it sounds like the melody is being pecked out by a row of musicians. __EOS__ Klein's music, wrote Ben Ratliff in The New York Times, sounds like nothing else. That takes the composer a little aback. __EOS__ I'm surprised that no one is doing what I'm doing if it's that original, because for me it's not original, it's just like a lot of people should be doing these type of things, things that are cross-styles, because that's what we are.

50633," I take women sort of unsung heroines, usually from history but a lot from mythology and some from literature who wouldn't necessarily make the cut for mainstream animated princess movies and give them that styled sort of  -alternate reality glimpse into what if they got their moment in the sun.__EOS__ Can you give us some of your favorite examples?__EOS__ ""The Tank commander,"" this is a...__EOS__ One of my favorites.",3
50634," Human nature is always really the X factor in this, because where the gains have really come from, in my opinion, is simply cars have become safer and the roads have been made safer. I don't think there's been a qualitative improvement in the way people are driving. __EOS__ Tom Vanderbilt wrote a book about driving, and he focused a lot on the quirks of the human beings behind the wheel - humans who did not evolve to move at 60 miles an hour or faster. He says our perception of risk on the road is often at odds with reality. __EOS__ This is the classic case of risk perception of being wrong in traffic. People fear roundabouts in America. They've been called circles of death, and nothing could be further from the truth. Part of this is simply the geometry of a roundabout. It eliminates one of the most dangerous moves you can make in traffic, which is a left turn against fast-moving oncoming traffic. __EOS__ You mean you make me nervous, and consequently I will drive more safely?

But lets face it, there weren't a lot of women rockers who could compete for that crown. __EOS__ Well, I started in country music and then in 1955, after I graduated from high school, the first touring that I did was with a young fellow early in his career too and it was Elvis Presley. And I worked with Elvis off and on for a couple of years and I could see that this new style of music that he was doing that, you know, I love it. And I was with him right as he was really breaking big, you know. And he's the one that encouraged me to try. He said I think you could sing this kind of music. And being this country, you, I said I don't think I could ever get the feel like you do. He said sure you can. So he encouraged me. He took me to his home and played records and then hed sing for me and say now you got to do it this way and so, you know, I had a good teacher. __EOS__ So one of the things Elvis was famous for in addition to his singing style was how he looked on stage. You know, he was very sexy and he was very sexually suggestive on stage, particularly for the period. Did you pick up on that aspect as well? Did you change what you wore?

I think the other thing which was brought - which Doug brought up is that these ceremonies are beautiful. There's something artful and something quite beautiful about these endings, and it reminds me of a passage that I quote in the book from W.E.B. Du Bois when he talks about beauty and death. It's a lovely essay. When he talks about in order that endings, goodbyes, departures are complete and therefore they're beautiful, and that ugliness just strings along endlessly. That is, things that are ugly don't have an end. So the idea of making endings beautiful and marking them that way artfully as a time of expression is so important, it seems to me.__EOS__ You also wrote very interestingly, I thought, about John-Paul Sartre's play ""No Exit,""...__EOS__ Yes.",0

50648," Let's take an example. __EOS__  I like the sunrise because it brings a new day. I like a new day. It brings new hope, they say. __EOS__ ""I Like the Sunrise,"" written by Duke Ellington. You use tenor saxophonist Von Freeman's improvised melody from a 2002 recording, and then the lyrics are adapted from the 13th century Persian poet Rumi. Why does this work for you? __EOS__ Intuition. You know, Duke has always had, for me and I think for many Duke Ellington fans, a very natural and graceful spiritual element to the things that he wrote and the things that he got his orchestra to play. So it seemed to me a very natural link-up between Duke and Von Freeman, whom I know very well, and then of course Rumi, who's having this wonderful renaissance. ",2
50649," Jennifer Homans, let's begin with you. As you know, classical Greeks didn't have ballet, but you see Apollo as a kind of symbol for ballet. __EOS__ That's right. Apollo is a symbol for ballet because dancers over the ages have looked back to the Greeks, even though the Greeks themselves did not, of course, perform ballet, which has its origins in the European courts of the Renaissance in the 17th century. But the idea of Apollo as a perfectly proportioned beautiful human figure is something that's inspired people for ages. So, you know, Apollo is a recurrent theme throughout the history. Louis XIV, when he was performing at his height, often liked to portray Apollo. And he would dress in great plumes and Greek or Roman dress and he would perform the ""Sun King,"" which gave him his own identity and showed his own power in court in France in the 17th century. So the idea of Apollo through the ages has been very, very powerful. __EOS__ You trace the origins of ballet to the French court. __EOS__ Yes. The French Court is where ballet was first codified. There were shadows of it before and it was a social dance evolving, but it was only in the French court of Louis XIV that the positions were first given their names and that they were first actually written down in this case, and we still do have some of those drawings and writings.

50650," I can't answer that because, I'll be honest with you, I never read that much of the ""Superman"" stories. And I never read any ""Superman"" story in which Perry White appeared. I know the name, that's all. __EOS__ All right. Bill, thanks very much. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ Let's see if we go next to Carlos, Carlos with us from Charlottesville. ",0
50651," I see.__EOS__ But with skateboarding, you're gliding, you're going fast, sometimes you're on a ramp and you just feel on top of the world. But if you hit a pebble, you go flying off your skateboard and there's nothing to catch you. It's the pavement. It hurts. And so it was a concrete wave, like the metaphor to that was kind of just following through with a moment of what feels good. And it might wreak a lot of havoc, but it's so worth it for that second of being on the top.__EOS__  ...just one slip up. Did you ever ride a concrete wave? High as a kite till the crash does cave. Did you ever ride a concrete wave? Ride me on back to the golden days. To the top my head does burn with thoughts of you, I'll never learn.__EOS__ I'm talking to Kendra Morris. Her album is ""Banshee.""",2
50652," You're on your way back, for the weekend, to your home state of Texas. What do you expect people there to be asking you about? __EOS__ Well, I suspect more often they'll be asking me about things like the price of gasoline and immigration. This subject, as important as it is, I think it tends to be one I hear more about when I'm in Washington, D.C. than I do back home. People in my state believe very strongly that it is the government's primary responsibility to protect us and keep us secure. And they're willing to make some concessions in terms of their personal privacy in order to have that happen. __EOS__ We have reached you at the Baltimore Washington Airport, and a lot of people around you must be making cell phone calls. They are no longer unsuspecting about what's going on, and I bet you they're wondering what's next from the government, some of them anyway. __EOS__ We all have our imaginations piqued by shows like one of my favorites, 24, and other dramas and fictional accounts of what spies do. And you know, there's, some of those were based in a grain of truth. But I can assure you, based on everything I know, that the government is not out there spying on domestic activities by innocent people. Hopefully, Congress will remain strictly providing the oversight to make sure these are narrowly tailored programs designed to protect the American people, and that is indeed our responsibility. ",3
50653," Yeah. That's actually a very, very good way to put it. It's almost like the rational mind is still there, but you have a feeling that you have to do these things or there's great danger that his father might die if he didn't walk up and down the stairs over 16,000 times forward and backwards. His brain tells him that he won't die, that it's not true. But the feeling is so powerful that he really had to give in to the feeling. And the problem with OCD for most people is there's a disconnect between what we know and what we feel, and we generally - people go with what they feel. __EOS__ And Ed Zine, as you watched yourself in this condition that Dr. Jenike was describing, not only were you trapped by these rituals, there must have been an element of self loathing in there. __EOS__ What does mean, if you could explain? __EOS__ You hated yourself for being in the situation you were. ",0
50654," We're listening back to an interview with actor and musician Jack Black. More after a break; this is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ Let's get back to the interview I recorded with actor and musician Jack Black last April. Your breakout role was ""High Fidelity."" And ""High Fidelity,"" based on the novel by Nick Hornby, is set in a record store. You're one of the guys who works in the store. And you judge everybody - customers, your fellow workers - based on their taste in music. How did you get the role?__EOS__ Well, John Cusack was a friend from the Actors' Gang Theater Company - because he and Tim Robbins were tight buddies. And they were real...__EOS__ This is the theater company that you first worked in, when you were getting started. Yeah.",1
50655," No. They left me there in the forest. They were waiting for some special orders, or I don't know. I think my fate was being decided by somebody on the top. And they decided me to let go. Later on somebody called me from the hidden number and told me say thanks to your Stas Diriv . Stas Diriv was a politician and a very well-known businessman. I used to work with him as a press representative. And he - I don't know how he learned what he has done. But I think he saved my life at that time.__EOS__ How did you come to leave the region? I would think that you would want to be out of there. After those kinds of things have happened you would want to be out of there as soon as you possibly could get out of there.__EOS__ Well, actually, I never wanted to leave. I felt like leaving was a betrayal of all those people who continue suffer there. And I thought if I leave, it's going to send a signal. You know__EOS__ You can...",3
50656," Let's get back to Terry's 2012 interview with W. Kamau Bell. His new season of ""Totally Biased,"" which now appears on the new FXX network, is presented every weeknight and is performed live.__EOS__ Your wife is white, and you've talked a little bit in your act about what it's like to be a couple with a white woman.__EOS__ The reactions that you get from strangers and the reactions that you get from African-American women. So can you talk a little bit about that?__EOS__ Yeah. I mean it was funny. The first time me and my wife went out together, it wasn't even officially a date. We were in a taqueria in San Francisco, and a black woman and a black man came into the taqueria. And the black woman looked visibly shaken and kept looking and was really sort of like, just agitated.",3
50657," I don't think I should comment on what went on within the court. I can just say that it was consistent with what I said at the end of the brief. I think that the justices respected one another for the views that they expressed. __EOS__ It strikes me of all the Supreme Court decisions that I've ever tried to talk about on the air with a justice - and I've only interviewed you and Justice Breyer - but, like, that one seems like I don't want to go there. You know, that seems like the decision that justices, like, really don't want to talk about in public. __EOS__ I suppose that's right. You know, and of course I don't think it's been a decision that has been cited since it was handed down. __EOS__ Didn't the decision say it shouldn't be cited, that this was like a one-off, that this was meant to apply to this election only? ",3
50658,"    __EOS__ What was the name of this song we were listening to? __EOS__  The song you just heard is called ""A Night of Love."" It is part of the audio-visual library you have here. And visitors spend hours listening to Umm Kulthum, getting to know her, finding intimate articles about her life and the way she lived. __EOS__ There's also a library of books about the Umm Kulthum at the Cairo museum, including a biography written by Virginia Danielson, curator of the world music archive at Harvard University.  ",2
50659," There's other things I want to say. __EOS__ Well, one of the things that you are quoted as saying is that his scenes as George are a pivotal point in the film. __EOS__ To me, that interview is the key, the beating heart of the whole thing. I think that the character is so incredibly offensive, so incredibly off-putting for so many reasons, and then gradually through revealing insecurities and vulnerabilities turns out to be just this scared guy who has basically found no way to protect himself from the world. __EOS__ Keep going, just keep going. ",1
50660," Yes we do.__EOS__ Did lawyers ever enter into it, or is it still just a handshake?__EOS__ Well, they tried to muck it up a few times. We did. And that's the truth. We did say...__EOS__ You did what?",2
50661," And he told ""GQ"" in January 2006 that the reason why he wrote ""School of Rock"" was that he was really - he really liked you personally, and he said, ""I really believe in him as an actor, but all the scripts that were being sent to him were very much like the fratty guy who gets drunk and falls down. I think originally, they were trying to put him in a John Belushi or even Chris Farley - kind of little bit tubby, very sophomoric comedy thing. And in my opinion, there's such a bigger charm to him."" So that's what Mike White, the writer of ""School of Rock,"" had to say.__EOS__ I don't think that that's necessarily a real problem. The real problem is - well, the real challenge is, if you don't look super sexy, like a Brad Pitt...__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ ...you're going to have to try harder, that's all. You've got to make up for it in other ways. You're going to have to charm the pants off them. You're going to have to make them laugh. You're going to have to find some other - but those are good hoops to have to jump through. You're going to have to do some writing. Let's face it, the great comedians now that are handicapped in the looks department, are tremendous writers. I'm not going to say who they are 'cause now they'll be offended. But you know who you are, if you're listening, and you know that I'm right.",1
50662," Yes, yes, exactly. __EOS__ A man with long, yellowing, Howard Hughes fingernails. He craves decay. __EOS__ We fiction authors, we love creating the bad guys. There's nothing like a good villain. And with Hydt, I wanted to create an individual who was what I typically do with a villain. They're fully formed. They certainly are despicable - that's what makes them villains - and yet there's got to be something rather intriguing about them. __EOS__ I sure hope Hydt doesn't succeed - but on the other hand, I kind of feel for him, in a way, because this is something that's very important to him, this nefarious Incident 20, which I call it. ",0
50663," And you weren't the only one who had a success with it, of course.__EOS__ No, of course not. That song was - well, with Whitney, you know, she took it worldwide, and with Kevin Costner choosing it for the theme song for ""The Bodyguard"" movie. Then it just went - just became one of the biggest love songs ever. And it's just a gift that keeps on giving. But it started as a very simple song based on a heartfelt feeling.__EOS__ We're talking with Dolly Parton about her new book ""Dream More  Celebrate the Dreamer in You."" And we want to hear from the dreamers in our audience and how you've had to adjust them  800-989-8255. Email us  talk@npr.org. And let's start with Louis, and Louis on the line with us from Boulder, in Colorado.__EOS__ How are you doing this afternoon?",0
50664," Well, I actually started my relationship with them 10 years ago, and I - they invited me out there. And I didn't really want to just sort of walk around and sort of be a sort of alien on the ground and stick out like a sore thumb. I wanted to get involved, and the thing that I'm passionate about is music. So they were amazingly open to the idea, and they introduced me to some extraordinary musicians from Mali. And there's been a lot of water under the bridge since then. But 10 years later, we felt that it was time to do another record in that - with that kind of spirit.  __EOS__ And this time, I just didn't have the sort of time that I had last time. And I thought, well, an easy way to get around that would be to invite a group of producers, not musicians, a group of producers, and take them and give them five days, give them maximum access to the musicians in Kinshasa and try to interpret what they were playing to us. Because, I mean, the basic premise was that they would play, and we would record and then go off to our computers and sort of manipulate the sounds and - but there was one rule, which was that every sound we use had to come from the experiences we were having in Congo.  __EOS__ There are elements of dance music in here and electronic music and also very spare, more sort of traditional African music.  __EOS__ Yeah. Yeah. I think - I mean, it's only a snapshot really, if you like. I am a part of a radio broadcast of what was happening.  ",2
50665, Only once.__EOS__ But I have watched the clips on YouTube of the various songs an uncountable number of times.__EOS__ .__EOS__ .,1
50666,"  A hundred and fifty years ago. __EOS__  Yeah.  And there's music that's just as old if not older from      Yemen.  There's amazing Jewish music from Yemen, from Egypt, from Syria.      So even if you're going to look at that, just saying--just, you know,      relegating Jewish music to klezmer is really, really pigeonholing it.  So      I find that people are a little slow to warm up to it, but you know, when      they hear it, end up kind of saying, `Oh, there is something kind of      Jewish to it, but it's not klezmer.' __EOS__  Jon Madof, thank you. __EOS__  Thank you. ",2
50667," And on top of that, why do they want to run up to me after they have done so to let me know how happy they're that they stink. __EOS__ The later is probably sharing with you their excitement, right, as you share with them all their successes. This is like a constant question for science, that science is not answered - why they roll in something smelly. And I think the best answer is really that they probably just like the smell and that's about it. But there are plenty of other theories you'll hear, but none has been supported or really tested. __EOS__ You say one of the things that happened is, ordinarily, a lot of times after a dog has been given a bath, they will run outside and find something to roll in. __EOS__ Right. I don't think that they enjoy being bathed in coconut lavender shampoo. I mean, their scent is part of their identity. Obviously, we see them sniffing each other all the time and they're trying to get a good whiff of the other dog. And if we cover that up, in some ways, we're concealing their identity. ",0
50668," But before we let you go, you mentioned that when the original Black Panther came out, it came out at the same time - the original comic, it came out at the same time that the movement - the political movement was born, and it clearly was some of a resonance. What is it you think people are responding to now in your series? __EOS__ Well, I think, you know, the idea of an uncompromised, unabashedly heroic black man. I mean, black men get a lot of bashing in the press. At the same time, there's so many heroes from - in popular media, from Sidney Poitier to Denzel Washington, to Will Smith. And I think there's a tremendous hunger from all audiences for a black superhero - not an anti-hero, but a hero, a guy who is independent, who stands on his own feet. The same way we cheer for the independence movements that's happening throughout Africa and the Middle East, because you see people standing up and fighting for what's right. The Black Panther represents those ideals played out on a big, fantastic scale. __EOS__ Reginald Hudlin is one of the creators of the animated series ""The Black Panther."" He's a filmmaker. He's also the former president of entertainment for the cable network BET. He was with us from NPR West. __EOS__ Thank you. ",3
50669,"  When he was a little boy, I'll say maybe about five years      old, he used to go to the store with me a lot and his thing was      protecting me.  He said, `Gram, you can't walk.'  He calls me Gram.  `You      can't walk by yourself 'cause I've got to go with you.'  So he would hold      my hand across the street, but he was always protective.  He wanted to      protect me all the time. __EOS__  Do you still believe that he's here protecting you? __EOS__  Yes, I do.  I really do.  I think he always will. __EOS__  Hi.  My name is Victoria Chau. ",3
50670," Hey, how are you guys doing? __EOS__ Okay. __EOS__ I am a writer and a musician and author, coincidentally enough, a ferret owner. And when I was — in reading and in both composing literature and music, I find that I draw from resources and sometimes inadvertently find myself coming across something that I'd have to say, oh, well, that's already been done. I wanted to know if the writer thought that this plagiarism was flattery or if you take insults of it. __EOS__ Well, initially, I was a little miffed. But then I had to laugh at the absurdity of the situation simply because… ",0
50671," Oh, it sounds very right, and, you know, I agree. And I think what  as I remember reading about duels is many times, they would go through the motions, but maybe all shoot high or just up in the air just to make sure they went through the motions and they both kept their honor. __EOS__ As in the Duke of Wellington's case, exactly that happened, though it's not quite clear the duke did that. As we mentioned, he was a bad shot. __EOS__ But his opponent, Lord Winchilsea, intentionally shot in the air because he didn't want to kill the Duke of Wellington. __EOS__ Chris, thanks very much for the phone call. We appreciate it. ",0
50672," And then we got across - halfway across the floor, and ""Bye Bye Love"" by The Everly Brothers came on. And it stopped us in our tracks. We had - we sang together, so we knew what two-part harmony was, but this sounded so unbelievably beautiful. I mean those - they're brothers, of course, The Everly Brothers, and they're from Kentucky, and they have this beautiful accent, and they could harmonize unbelievably, very much like the Louvin Brothers, who they probably learned from.__EOS__ You know, it's interesting that both The Hollies' and The Beatles' names were inspired by Buddy Holly. I didn't realize that about The Hollies till reading your book, but you know, The Hollies is inspired by Buddy Holly. The Beatles, at least one of the stories about the Beatles is that they were inspired by Buddy Holly's backup singers.__EOS__ The Crickets.__EOS__ The Crickets, yeah. So why Buddy Holly? Like why weren't you The Elvises or The Bo Diddleys or The Everly - well, no the Everlys were already the Everlys. You couldn't, couldn't do that.",0
50673," Absolutely. I mean, actually, this is - I remember one of the first SCIENCE FRIDAYs I ever heard was Dr. Earle talking about that untethered trip she took where she was wearing this gym suit and it really is sort of a bulky marshmallow-man suit...__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ ...1,200 feet down and set the record in '79 for one of the deepest, I think, untethered walking on the sea floor. I just remember how inspiring it was to hear about that. And she set, yeah, many records in her time.__EOS__ This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow here with Flora Lichtman. We're talking about her latest desktop diary about Sylvia Earle, the undersea explorer. And she is still - on the video, it's up there on our website at sciencefriday.com, and you see her jump into this globe like she's 12, you know?",3
50674,"  Nobody dies anymore. But that's not on a . Some things do change.  But nobody dies, nobody dies, nobody dies.__EOS__ Pondering mortality. That's where Jeff Tweedy's head was when he began on these songs, not knowing what was to come next. His wife Susie was diagnosed with cancer.__EOS__ How is she doing first of all?__EOS__ She's doing well and her prognosis is very favorable and it's been an incredible thing to witness someone being so strong in the face of something so serious and terrifying.",2
50675," Okay. __EOS__ Bye, bye. Joan Gaudet, it must be great to hear people like that thank you for what you do? __EOS__ It is. I love to hear that. And thats the way we want it to be -for them to really feel welcomed home and glad to be back. __EOS__ And Aron, lets get back to the son and the filmmaker, Aron Gaudet, who is with us from New York. That is superficially what this film is about. You go a little bit more deeply into the lives of, well, your mom and the two other men you profile, to explain a little bit about what it means to be elderly in America and what it means to have something greater than yourself to give yourself to, even late in life? ",1
50676," Nice? OK. Femi Kuti is a world renown Nigerian singer and musical artist. His latest album is ""Africa for Africa."" And he's currently touring the U.S. with his band The Positive Force and we caught up with him at member station WGBH in Boston. __EOS__ Thank you, Michel. __EOS__ To check out the upcoming cities and dates of Femi's tour, please go to the Program page of npr.org and select TELL ME MORE. __EOS__  Who is that man talking to? He think say he dey talk to fool. He walk in way to come near me. He just want come disturb my peace. He like to buy me anything. He wants to buy my loyalty. But can't buy me. Can't buy me. Nobody can. Can't buy me. Na so I dey look am. Can't buy me. As in dey talk me. Can't buy me... ",2
50677," And connections not only to companies that me might own stock in or memories of our ancestors who may have fought on one side or the other in the Civil War but memories that - well, you're personally involved in this too not just the bricks around the corner from your house? __EOS__ Well, that's true. That isn't why I - that's the reason why I began on the book but I was surprised to find myself connected to the book in ways that I hadn't expected. But to back up a little bit, I was born in the Mississippi Delta in the fall of 1964 just after Freedom Summer, when Schwerner, Goodman and Cheney were murdered by the Ku Klux Klan and there were churches burning all over Mississippi and the Deep South was, you know, the darkest years of the Civil Rights era were beginning. And then when I began first grade in a little cotton town, I was in the first class of children in Mississippi where blacks and whites began school together and went through 12 years of education together. And so as long as I can remember, I've been digging around trying to understand these things. And as I dug into the book, I also eventually found my own family tying back to the place and some of the people in this book back in Alabama. __EOS__ Douglas Blackmon, thanks very much for your time today. __EOS__ Thank you. ",0
50678," Kid, you've got a picture. __EOS__ So as everything in his life is falling to pieces, he decides he's going to seek the advice of his rabbi. He goes to a series of rabbis. __EOS__ And what they say is, like, not helpful and sometimes it makes no sense at all. What was the germ of this idea for the film of this man who is beset by problems, not boils like Job but, like, 1967 kinds of problems and he goes to a rabbi... __EOS__ No boils with his brother has a sebaceous cyst on the back of his neck. ",1
50679," Yes. __EOS__ And you make a comparison between what he did and what you do as a restaurant critic. Can you elaborate on that? __EOS__ Yes, I mean, in a way you're undercover. You're sneaking in. You're observing, and nobody knows that you're really observing. And you're taking notes. And there's a kind of stealthiness about it, as well. __EOS__ You've seen so many changes come and go in the food world. And you have a son, Alexander, and one of the questions you pose in the book is what kind of food will he be eating in the future? Have you found an answer to that? ",0
50680," Well, I remember that I screamed and it was a scream like a beast's scream. And I'm not sure if the scream was of joy or of fear, because in a moment, I remember looking at the eyes of William, one of my companions -he was sitting beside me - and we were so frightened, because this was like the end of that life and the beginning of a new one. And what was that new one coming. __EOS__ The end of the movie. __EOS__ End of the movie. The horrible ending, we're going to crash. And we didn't. We landed like a rose on that tarmac in a village in the jungle of Colombia. And when the door opened, that's when I realized the dream had come true. __EOS__ I read that you decided within the last two years that for the rest of your life you're going to wear perfume every day and that you're not going to deprive yourself of eating cake. Anything else that you promised yourself? ",0
50681,"  Why didn't you say so? If I could be anything instead of a Ugandan, I would be a Scot. __EOS__  Really? Really. __EOS__  Except for the, the red hair - which I am sure is attractive to your women, but which we Africans we find this quite disgusting. __EOS__ I just wonder about your portrayal of him. It looks to me as though these really are Ugandan villages and these aren't actors. And to see you in the role of this character, I wonder if you saw people reacting to that. ",3
50682,"   And Holly wore a cross to Wal-Mart.  She      said, `If they think if you're a Christian, then they want to pray in the      dark.'  She said, `If they think you're a Catholic, then they'll want to      be your boss.' And Holly wore a cross to Wal-Mart. __EOS__  Church, drugs and rock 'n' roll exist on equal footing.  Finn and      company clearly have a great deal of affection for the ostentatious,      overblown scope of classic rock, much as Finn does for his own Catholic      upbringing.  But neither one is sacred.  Holly isn't saved solely because      she's a Catholic and isn't condemned just because she's a screw-up who      loves rock 'n' roll.  Critic Jessica Hopper says somehow the band holds      these disparate elements together. __EOS__  The magic of The Hold Steady is the dichotomy between      almost, you know--and I mean this in the best possible way--the dumbness      of the big classic rock with the elaborate, ornate and almost literary      aspect of the lyrics, that it's so literate with something that's so      last-call bar rock. __EOS__   Nelson Algren came to party at the party at      the dead-end alley.  Yeah, he told them what to celebrate.  And I met      William Butler Yeats at the Sunday night dance party, summer 1988.  At      first, I thought it might be William Blake. ",2
50683,"  God already knows whatever it is, Peggy. __EOS__  Well, then I don't need to talk. __EOS__  Well, I'm here, right now. __EOS__  Father, don't take this the wrong way, but I don't think you'd understand. ",3
50684," Well, I mean, first, let me say what I mean by bloated. I mean, heres an industry which was just reaping in epic profits more than the tax sector, more than biotech. And just like any industry that goes through a boom, its not unusual to need to see some pruning. __EOS__ Now, I realized that there are lots and lots of properties with mortgages on them. But as a layman, I find this very puzzling. It would seem to me that by now, the banks and the regulators would have at least plumbed the depths of that crisis and come up with a good sense of whos exposed to how much risk of delinquency or default. __EOS__ Well, the point is its not just a matter of some bad debts. If that were all that were, you could recapitalize the system, so to speak, give them fresh infusions of cash, and theyd be off to the races again. __EOS__ That the business was simply overgrown, it assumed more financial sector activity than our economy actually can sustain. ",3
50685," He was someone who you also say spent very little of his life alone. __EOS__ Yeah, I think he was alone in an existential sense. You know, Phil Linz was a utility infielder who came to the Yankees as... __EOS__ Mr. Harmonica, we always... __EOS__ Mr. Harmonica - in 1962. And Mickey lockered that year, my favorite baseball verb, between two rookies, Tom Tresh and Phil Linz. And Pete Sheehy, the locker room, clubhouse guy, you know, who assigned the lockers did that deliberately. ",0
50686," Sometimes they seem to think, you know, I came out of the womb, you know, cursing with an electric guitar, you know, so I think it's important for people to realize that we were all young, all naive, and also we had lived in a time that had magic. __EOS__ Its a very romantic book in some ways. __EOS__ It was a romantic time. __EOS__  I just dont know what to do tonight.

50687," Yeah. __EOS__ The ones I'm talking about tend to be from between 1945 and 1960, and - you know, I think this is so technological you won't be able to use it. __EOS__ No... __EOS__ Let's go on to another question. ",2
50688,"  Hi.  How you doing? __EOS__  Good. __EOS__  My question was first of all, had Osama bin Laden mentioned      Israel, in particular?  If so, did that have anything to do--Israel's      relationship with the United States have anything to do with his dealings      towards the United States? __EOS__  Thank you, Luke. ",0
50689," Well, then what have you learned from complaints that Ford isn't building cars that people want to buy? __EOS__ Well, I think one of the things that we've learned the most is sometimes in the past we tried to be all things to all people. And the one thing that we have learned through this process is tightening up what the Ford brand, the Lincoln brand and the Mercury brand stand for, and making sure we target appropriately, which means being not all things to all people. __EOS__ With the recent cutbacks and the idling of plants, Ford has gotten smaller. Is it willing to become a smaller company with a smaller market share into the future? __EOS__ Well, you know, based on where we were ten years ago, we are a smaller company both in terms of people and market share. And I think we've done a lot of shrinking over the last ten years, and it's time to stop. ",3
50690," I understand that. But if I wanted to place a bet online, I don't just log on and give them my MasterCard number, do I? __EOS__ Well, you can't do that in the U.S. at this point. __EOS__ Right. Where they meant - so how do we make this transaction? __EOS__ Well, the movement of the money has changed dramatically in the last year. I mean, five years ago, 98 percent of the transactions of U.S. citizens that were trying to deposit into an account, most of that was done with Visa or MasterCard. That got - began to get restricted about three to four years ago, and as of a bill that was passed last year, almost all methods of transferring those payments is now supposed to be illegal. But there are still a variety of ways to do it for those companies that are taking U.S. play. ",3
50691," Am I the right person to do this? I'm just a little, you know - who do I compare to the big authors, you know? __EOS__ Well, you're absolutely right. I had a lot of hesitation about even - I mean, as I said, the initial feeling was, I must be wrong. And of course, there is a guy, Robert Bruce... __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ Spent 11 years doing a very authoritative... ",0
50692," I thought it was kind of the opposite, like this stuff is so good...__EOS__ ...I'm going to show off. No?__EOS__ That's, that's what - yeah, they want, that's what we want you to believe. But the reality is, and no one else will admit to this - well, maybe they will - is you're on stage in front of - now with summer jams and things like that, people are getting put on stage in front of 50,000 people with a record that's a radio hit, and they've never performed before. It's going to be a disaster nine times out of 10.__EOS__ So do you feel like you were on stage before you were prepared for it? Probably not, because you did parties before that. You had experience.",0
50693," Yes.__EOS__ My guest is David Crist, author of the new book ""The Twilight War  The Secret History of America's Thirty-Year Conflict with Iran."" We'll talk more after break. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is David Crist. He's the author of the new book ""The Twilight War  The Secret History of America's Thirty-Year Conflict with Iran.""__EOS__ Yes.",0
50694," But sorting through all these candidates can be tough.__EOS__ It's pretty challenging.__EOS__ Chastity Wells is on Ewing's team.__EOS__ Our interns go through a really extensive process, interviewing. The application isn't too bad.",1
50695," He said that he would have been a hero in his community for killing Al Sharpton because at that time, his community felt that they were under siege because we were fighting this race case. He ended up understanding our protest because this kid, Yusef Hawkins, a black kid, was only killed because they didn't want blacks in that neighborhood. __EOS__ And you used some language, which you later came to regret. And we actually have that on tape. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ And I'm going to play it for you. ",3
50696," I've got to say this singer, Katherine Whalen, is someone who would be probably pretty well-known to NPR listeners because we used to follow this group that she was a founding singer of, the Squirrel Nut Zippers. __EOS__ Yeah. That's where she rose to prominence, but now she's engaged on this very interesting solo career, and her own stuff, it's all over the place. It's kind of funky, it's kind of jazzy, but mostly urban-sounding, even though she's a good ol' Southern country gal, I believe. __EOS__ The thing about this song is, there's no production in it. It almost sounds like someone kind of recorded this on their back porch or something. __EOS__ Yeah. Frankly, we didn't even know - we're not sure what those instruments are. I mean, it could be a ukulele and a nylon-string guitar, but who knows? It's kind of funny. It just shows you that when you're a great singer, what do you need? You just need something to sing along with. I mean, I guess she could've sang hauntingly with a kazoo, if you've got that voice. ",3
50697, So carefully put. Yes.__EOS__ ...in rock history.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ Did you all sing the high parts in your bands before getting together?,0
50698," They know things about being that we forget. And if we could somehow recognize that their lives are valuable in and of themselves, we might be able to structure the system in a slightly less-expensive way that it's not so daunting to care for one of these kids. __EOS__ My guest is Ian Brown. His new memoir about his disabled son is called ""The Boy in the Moon."" __EOS__ My guest is Canadian journalist Ian Brown.

50699,"  I want you the right way, baby. I want you but I want you to want me too.__EOS__ A lot of songs on this album are covers of tunes. You have Marvin Gaye, Fleetwood Mac, Bob Marley. I want to talk to you about ""32 Flavors,"" though. That's an Ani DiFranco song originally. What attracted you to that tune?__EOS__ Oh, the lyric, because, you know, Ani DiFranco is such an incredible wordsmith.__EOS__  Squint your eyes and look a bit closer. I'm not between you and your ambition. I am a poster girl with no poster and I am 32 flavors and then some.",2
50700," If I may, Michel...__EOS__ Go ahead, Senator Taylor. Sure.__EOS__ ...pick up on that.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.",3
50701," Now, your son is the director, and it's interesting because the story ""Tiger Eyes"" actually mimics your lives in a way, right? At one point, you uprooted your family and went to New Mexico.__EOS__ We did. Although when I was writing the book, it had nothing to do with that, and it's so interesting to see the movie now and I feel so differently was I, you know, when you're writing, you really don't know where your ideas are coming from. I was a girl who lost her beloved father suddenly. He wasn't shot and killed; he died of a heart attack. I was with him at the time. My mother lived 30 years after that and was never able to talk about that day. I learned very quickly that I couldn't say anything about it because it would just be so hard for her.__EOS__ I'm here for you if ever you want to talk about that. But the child doesn't always take them up on it.__EOS__ And your books do a good job of sort of showing both sides of that. Even though it's from the point of view of the kid, you get that there an unreliable narrator in a way. And you were writing these as a parent, right? I mean did this kind of affect the way you thought about your kids?",1
50702," And you write he got to be the fun parent.__EOS__ And he did. He - and he's a great dad. But he did all the fun stuff, and then I was the nagger. And have you done this, and why didn't you clean up your room? And, you know, it sort of turned me into this role that I didn't like seeing myself in. So I just made this bargain. I got so angry. I was just so angry and defensive. And it really took me a long time to see how much I had been a part of creating that, because I thought I had to be this ideal mother. You know...__EOS__ What else do you feel like you did to create it?__EOS__ Well, because I didn't let Tom have time alone with the kids. I felt like - you know, when you think about it, I had the maternity leave. Tom, at the time, worked for a company that had a policy on the books that said that men could take parental leave. But everybody knew that if a man did it, it was the kiss of death. It was just not done.",0
50703," Well, in 2011 there was a slowdown; the Ethiopian government imposed a slowdown in the number of adoption cases that it was going to process of about 90 percent - down from I think 50 cases a day down to five. And that lasted for a short period of time and was extremely controversial. Here in the U.S., adoption advocates and parents were talking about it almost as a hostage situation - saying, you know, how can the Ethiopian government be doing this and, you know, responding to a few bad cases with this massive shutdown that's going to hurt so many other children. And eventually it seems that those numbers started to creep back up to a standard level, what the levels had been before. I do think, you know, it seems like Ethiopia is doing things to try to impose some more safeguards, but you know, adoptions do seem to be continuing for now as normal.__EOS__ You write in the book that one African country that took a different approach is Rwanda, which looked as if it could have been the next, you know, hotspot for adoptions and replicated the experience of Ethiopia and other places. What was it that the Rwandan government did that was different?__EOS__ That was very interesting and I have to say this was kind of my experience of, you know, having my preconceptions challenged and upended. I went to Rwanda thinking, because Rwanda has an intense culture of evangelical missionaries, especially from the U.S. and especially from some of the churches that have been on the front lines of promoting adoption and orphan care, including Rick Warren's Saddleback Church, which has an enormous presence there.__EOS__ And you've also seen some of these evangelical organizations actively involved in alternatives, right? Like in supporting, you know, programs which will assist families in staying together so the kid doesn't have to go away.",0
50704," Yes, that's very significant. The purpose of that event is to fight the spirit of Islam. In other words, to conduct spiritual warfare against the demons which they claim hold Muslims in bondage and keep them from converting. Now, of course, this is expressed in terms of love. They say we don't hate Muslims. We love Muslims but we hate that they are in spiritual bondage and don't convert to Christianity. __EOS__ So do you think that the people at the rally intend to go to mosques or directly address Muslims in any way? Like I don't know how much you know about what the plan is. __EOS__ I don't know of specific plans. I can give you examples from the past. In 2008, just before the election, they held one of The Call events in Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego. This was an event in support of Prop 8. __EOS__ Which was meant to make gay marriage illegal.

50705," Jimmy Rose sends out to the people in Oregon, Washington, Ohio, Wyoming, and Montana another great Sunshine jamboree. __EOS__ It's Saturday night, late summer 1953, and the Snake River Outlaws are onstage at the Sunshine Bar, dressed in creased gabardine slacks, embroidered Western shirts, scarves, and cowboy hats. __EOS__ Yes, this is your answer to a good time in these parts, friends. If you're riding around or just sitting at home thinking about what to do, you can stop thinking and come on down and join this huge crowd of happy people. It's music of our West for the next half hour by the four Snake River Outlaws, Jimmy Widner, Orval Fochtman, and Vern and Harold Wilburn. __EOS__ I remember my dad saying that people would park their cars all around the block, double parking, blocking the streets. People in there with their Model A jalopies, but there would also be rich people in Cadillacs with mink coats sitting in their cars listening to the radio, waiting for a chance to get into the bar to actually see the band. ",2
50706,  Mm-hmm.  So you had some amazing faith that carried you through      this. __EOS__  Yeah... __EOS__  Almost... __EOS__  ...I had some faith and I think so. ,0
50707," Kind of ironic, isn't it?__EOS__ Well, I think, you know, as an actor that's what you do. You continue to surprise your audiences, that they're not quite sure what to make of it. I hope the audience when they see it they're not going to go, come on Michelle. Just jump over the table and kick their ass.__EOS__ I hope that after a few minutes they do not see me anymore.__EOS__ May I ask, is there a dearth of good roles for Asian actresses in Western cinema?",1
50708," They were pretty surprised. They, I think, had some encounters with why didn't I know this, or why didn't I ask somebody. There was a little bit of discussion about why none of us really quizzed my grandmother enough, and some shame I think that we all feel for not having been more curious, because the story was so incredible. And then also I wonder if my grandmother even knew all of what it was that I ended up finding out. __EOS__ We spoke with Henry Louis Gates earlier and talking about his series on PBS about ancestry. And he talked about the importance of genealogy, knowing where you came from. His main focus was on Africa, for African Americans. But talk to me on how you changed your view, if at all, or perhaps seen it in a different light since doing the research and then writing the book. __EOS__ I was empowered by it the same way I've been empowered by finding my Davis family, the black family over the years I've learned more about them, which was very empowering. But I grow up with there lure. So this has given me a sense of greater belonging and a greater claim on a wider range of places, not only in America, but--because I too did my DNA, I feel some connection now to a specific spot in Africa, Sierra Leone. So it's made me feel like a much more effective person, like I'm going to be effective and more understanding. __EOS__ Finally, what do you want the reader to come away with at the end of the book? ",0
50709," No doubt.__EOS__ Well, Cee-Lo, Big Gipp, thank you guys so much for coming in and talking about this.__EOS__ Thank you.__EOS__ Oh, thank you so much, man. We really appreciate it.",2
50710," …and wanted to stick it in the show. What I love about that is that it doesn't make any sense. My character, Andy Bernard, is a preppy, Connecticut, yacht club kid. Why on Earth would he play the banjo? But for some - it's just one of those fun mysteries about Andy Bernard, I guess. __EOS__ Right. Don't think about it too much. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ We should give the audience a taste, here. And I thought we would share this moment from ""The Office"" where you're in the break room with Dwight, one of the other characters. And you're - Dwight has his guitar, you have your banjo, and you're trying to impress the new receptionist. Let's listen. ",1
50711," ...when your head hits the pillow, don't worry about what you have to do tomorrow, because it's not going to prepare you any better. Just be in the moment and be present, and things will go your way. And I feel like that was... __EOS__ That's the wisdom you've come by. __EOS__ I take tremendous solace in that, actually. __EOS__ So you've learned to accept the complete unpredictability and sometimes unreality of your lives. ",2
50712," Sure. So, how do you evaluate them? Because it appears when I listen to the finished product, that, to you, songs not only have to sound great but they have to have some kind of meaning. __EOS__ I feel a certain amount of responsibility. And I, you know, as I get older, I feel like I'm able to articulate a message a little bit better than I was when we first started. But, yeah, I mean, I guess it's because of the impact that music had on me. I feel a responsibility. But at the same time, I think music can also be very light-hearted and... __EOS__ Yeah, there are the dance songs and the kind of anthem songs -everybody up on their feet. And there's ""Magdalena,"" which is a story song. __EOS__  Please don't tell me I can't make it. It ain't gonna do me any good. And please don't offer me your modern method, by fixing the carpets out of wood. From Nogales to Magdalena, there are 60 miles of sacred road. And the promise is made to those who venture, San Francisco, lift your load... ",2
50713," No, let's not go there. You know, like you sit with these thin women that say I can't, I don't eat. You want to say, you eat two meals, one going down and one coming up.__EOS__ Right. I hear what you're saying. But you had your issues with food and dieting, didn't you?__EOS__ Always. Always. And I am a closet bulimic. Right after my husband committed suicide, all I did was throw up, and someone explained to me that was, of course, that was the only control I had over my life at the moment. Maybe. You know, I know I look good.__EOS__ Have you ever wished that you didn't care that much about how you look?",0
50714," Bye-bye. People take inspiration from all kinds of things, certainly James Brown.__EOS__ Definitely. I mean, I know that James Brown had a large influence on hip-hop, so - definitely.__EOS__ And let's talk to Joe. Joe's calling us from Jacksonville, Florida.__EOS__ Yes. I'd like to add the song ""4th Branch"" by Immortal Technique. To me, it's an inspiring song because it's about empowering the little guy and the media being a check on the other branches of government and the importance of media and the importance of educating yourself...",2
50715," OK. __EOS__ It's so interesting you say that. He was just - and this is just my, you know, reading of it. The other side of all of those problems that were going on in the '80s and the '90s is there were plenty of people who were doing what they could, rightly or wrongly, bad and good, but just trying to address the problem and looking for any solution, no matter, you know, what it would be, I mean, sending kids to Kenya to live, you know, outside, completely outside of the community.  __EOS__ Gerald, thanks very much for the call. And I just want to ask, Ta-Nehisi Coates, your father, for political reasons, didn't celebrate July 4th, which also happened to be his birthday, or Christmas. Does he celebrate Father's Day? __EOS__ No. No, I called to offer him a happy Father's Day, because my better half told me that I had to about two years ago. An, you know, while he was ready for light, I talked to him afterward, he said that felt really, really awkward. My dad, when he came to Father's Day, just believed, man, you go out and you hustle every day. Every day is Father's Day. Go out and do it. That was his thing. ",0
50716," Yeah.__EOS__ Well, I tell you what, I mean, the best thing on that interview was the comment about Liberace. How genius was that? I don't remember saying it, but I'm quite proud of that. You know, at that point in my career, I was just so out of my depth, you know. I mean, suddenly, I'm, like, on national TV in America. And when you're that age, you know, and you're being asked to explain yourself before you really even know who you are, I mean, it's taken me, like, almost 52 years to work out who I am.__EOS__ You'll forgive me after hearing Johnny Carson and you not wanting to talk about your childhood for asking you about your childhood. You grew up in an Irish-Catholic family.__EOS__ I did.",2
50717," I know among the many things that you do is you practice emergency anesthesia medicine in a helicopter trauma unit, which is where you were last week, flying around. Do you expect you'd ever need to use this emergency training?__EOS__ Well, I hope not, but you know, I think a lot of the stuff I've done has given me a fairly healthy respect for things that I guess we take for granted and certainly respect for the physical environment around us. And helicopters are amazing vehicles, but they are quite fragile, and they are prone to accident. So you can't rule out the possible that flying over water one day you might have some catastrophic failure of the vehicle. So you've got to be prepared for that, I guess.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Dr. Kevin Fong. He's the author of the new book ""Extreme Medicine.""

To that end, Alvin, people always say, you know, don't make any big decisions, you know, in a crisis. But you can't help it. I mean, you can't help it. So for example if there's a job loss or sudden job loss you don't have a choice but to make some decisions. So what's the first thing you should do when you're faced with something - particularly something unexpected?__EOS__ Try to avoid making any decisions when your emotions are very high or you feel a lot of anxiety because almost always that indicates you're going to lose your perspective on the situation. So take some time and start taking notes on things that you need to take care of, things you need to look at financially and then prioritize those things over a time as you gain a little bit more - a calm about the situation. Because I've been in that situation where you walk into an office one day and your boss says to you, this is your last day on the job. And you walk out of there almost starstruck - just dumbstruck by the situation. And so, what I tell everybody, take some time and calm down and start to prioritize those things you need to pay attention to.",3

50720," I have been working with congregations for more than 30 years as a consultant and working in the area of family ministry. My husband is a seminary dean a New Testament professor and often serves in congregations as interim pastor. And I was just tired of watching congregations torn apart by this issue and watching the lives of survivors destroyed, their communities pulled away from them and watching the ministries of leaders destroyed. __EOS__ Valencia, we appreciate your willingness to join us to tell us what happened to you. Will you briefly tell us your story? __EOS__ Well, my story is this. I was 16, and I was a senior in high school, and I had sex for the first time, and I got pregnant. And I told two people, and I ended up aborting the baby because I had a scholarship to college the following fall. And I went to school, but after the abortion, I felt depressed, and I was very despondent because I'd grown up in the church, and I knew the teachings of the church and that abortion was murder. __EOS__ Oh, my goodness. ",3
50721," So what made you realize something had to change? Do you remember?__EOS__ The first thing that triggered it is I couldn't wear any of the clothes in my closet. I was wearing pants with elastic. And I wanted to go to a concert, and there was a suit in my closet, and I couldn't wear it. That's when I realized I was larger than I thought I was 'cause I always been kind of stocky, but I didn't realize I had gained so much weight 'cause I hadn't been going to the doctor and weighing myself. And the other thing is my family has a history of chronic illness, and I was my grandmother's caregiver. She had type one and a half diabetes and I was her caregiver from a small age, so I watched her have to change everything that she did with her life around that one disease. And like I said, my father had it, and that was just not something I wanted to have to include in my life.__EOS__ How did you go about getting a hold of the situation? I mean you also mentioned that there were a lot of other underlying issues involved. I mean people call it emotional eating for a reason. You had a lot of stuff to deal with. You know, you were having panic attacks and anxiety and a number of other things that you were dealing with. So what's your word of wisdom about this? I mean, is it total focus on that issue? Like, throw everything at it - focus on everything at once, or did you do the weight first, and then the other stuff followed? What's your guidance on this?__EOS__ For my experience, I actually started volunteering for a gym, and I offered to clean the gym twice a day in exchange for the services that they offer with fitness and nutrition. And once I started to exercise, I noticed that I started to have more energy, and I was more confident. So the mental aspect was addressed with exercising. 'cause I was recluse for a long time after my father was killed. So me getting up and just getting out the house and just walking at least half a mile to get fresh air was just a little bit of a confidence boost. So when I started to lose the weight, the mental health issues were addressed. I spoke to a therapist for about six months. Now I have those tools to help with the anxiety. And if I notice anything triggering that might make me go back into emotional eating, I have tools from the therapy sessions that help me. That's one of the things I want to encourage people that share my racial and ethnic background is to seek therapy if they need it. If you need professional help, as far as getting the tools that you need to cope with whatever it may be, anxiety - it could be anxiety and depression 'cause sometimes, they go hand-in-hand, but if you need that professional help, go get it.",3

This place will eat you up. __EOS__ How important is it for you to write and develop your own projects, like ""Human Giant,"" the MTV sketch comedy? ",1
50723," Right. Yes.__EOS__ ...That held this up because they felt that it doesn't deal with the real issue, which in their opinion is the Obama Administration's deferred action policy for young migrants which they feel - for people who were brought here as children by their parent - and it's an action to kind of address what a lot of people feel was kind of an unfair situation. And they feel that this what has kind of opened the green light to this movement. And so what's your take on this? Is it obstructionism or is it principal disagreement?__EOS__ Well, can't it be both? I mean, there's a mixture there, I believe, though there are those who are clearly disagreeing in principle. But I think one of the issues here is that the timing is so horrific for this. It wasn't done two months ago, three months ago, four months ago. It's being done the day before or the week before. Those people are going to go back to their districts and face the even more conservative population that they represent. And they're going to be facing some very, very ugly public meetings and very ugly town halls if they're compromising today in a way that if this were February, maybe they could've gotten away with it and moved on and said, we've done the right thing and compromised because we had to and had some time to cool the passions the way the Senate was designed to do and go back to your home district and say, yes, I did that and you disagree with it, but here are the reasons why. If it's the day before, that's tough.__EOS__ So you're saying it's a tactical fail?",3

I reckon we could make a deal or something.__EOS__  A deal for what?__EOS__  Food, food for a boat.__EOS__ He's a bum, Ellis. Come on.",1
50727," So how do you feel about that, having portrayed now a probably much more realistic view of what it's like to encounter violence, even if you're an armed officer of the law? What do you think, looking back on movies like ""Lethal Weapon,"" where no matter what's happening, it's time for a joke?__EOS__ Right. Well, I - look, I have very fond memories. That was my very first movie, and it was a great time. And I made some good money on it. That's what turned me into an actor from being a waiter.__EOS__ But, you know, I can see the arguments against those types of movies. But I don't know. I prefer the portrayal of law enforcement that we see with Hank Schrader because of the fact that it's a clearer and a more truthful, I think, portrayal. And, you know, maybe you just chalk ""Lethal Weapon 2"" movies up to what they're supposed to be, which is fun entertainment.__EOS__ And what kind of waiter were you before becoming an actor?",3
50728," Yeah, liked to take a nip, now and then.__EOS__ Is that the sort of thing you might put in your books?__EOS__ Yeah and nobody would believe it. It's like  Oh, Judge Hill, come on.__EOS__ Yeah. Yeah.",0
50729," Yeah, I had to be 14, yeah.__EOS__ And this was, what about 1963 or '64?__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ OK. So this is the song ""Who Can I Count On?"" And it's Bobby Darin and my guest Mary Clayton.",2
50730," Solidify your base. __EOS__ You know, I just think it's hard. I mean, this is actually not a Washington problem. If you average say the last 10 or 15 polls on where the public is on this bill, it's about 55 percent against 38 percent for. So, it's just hard to pass the major transformation domestic reform of our generation when the public is not there. And so I think it's - I'd give it an 80 percent chance that we'll get nothing just because it's very hard to pass something that's unpopular in an atmosphere of incredible distrust. And that really has to be underlined. We've had a whole bunch of polls that came out this week which underline we are at historic levels of distrust of Washington, distrust of Congress, distrust of everything. __EOS__ Let's talk about those polls, there is one in particular in The New York Times today, New York Times/CBS poll speaks to this whole question of bipartisanships  62 percent of the people polled believe the president is working with Congress. About the same percentage says Republicans are not trying to work with the president. David, where does that leave Republicans, do you think? __EOS__ It sort of weird when you compare it to, say, 1994 and other big elections. On the one hand, the Republicans as the out party are not as popular as they were in '94. Both parties are now unpopular. On the other hand, the desire to change Washington is actually stronger or as strong as '94. So, people desperately want a change, they just don't see any alternative. And the level of cynicism and disgust is really at historic highs. So, the question is can the Republicans in the next six, eight months establish themselves as an alternative. They are not there yet. ",3
50731," Thank you, David.__EOS__ So, your new book, these are really sad stories, many of them and very techie stories. Does technology make us lonely in a way?__EOS__ It makes me lonely.__EOS__ I think it could make us less lonely or more lonely at the same time.",0
50732," I think that one of the reasons it works so well is it has a great emphasis on technique and posture. So I followed this young girl Shiloh from when she started playing when she was six, and she's practiced every day for the last two years. And I had her at my opening night, I had a concert here at NYU, and she closed the show, and she practiced two years, and she was brilliant. And a lot of it was just about absolutely perfect technique. You know, every finger movement was just right.__EOS__ Every finger movement was just right, that's not necessarily always musical, though.__EOS__ I mean, I think partly it depends on the genre that you're kind of trying to play, and I think, you know, rock musicians might sometimes be sloppier than classical musicians. She was playing classical music. But I think that that emphasis on good technique is really important.__EOS__ Rachel is in Houston, Texas. Let's hear from Rachel.

50734,"  `So I'm 12 years old, and I go to      my local public library to get something for school.' __EOS__  Author and now librarian Patrick Jones. __EOS__  `I wasn't a big reader or library user.  It just wasn't      something I did.  As I go to check out my books, I see the library has      this whole shelf of different magazines.  I summoned up my 12-year-old      courage and asked the librarian if the library has any wrestling      magazines.  That's what I thought I asked.  Instead, I think I asked her      to show me what her face would look like if she sucked on a lemon for a      hundred years.  She'd look like she was about to stroke out at the mere      mention of wrestling magazines in her library.  She made me feel stupid,      and I never went back.' __EOS__  So I think in part, Patrick became a librarian just to      never do that to a kid.  Like, if a kid came in interested in some      subject, he'd find that book for him or find that magazine, 'cause that      is a big piece, I think, of what's wrong with how we're promoting      literacy.  We're promoting such a narrow version of literacy that we're      not including what a lot of boys like. ",0
50735," Look up the street, or down the street, this way or that way. We saw only America. __EOS__ That was an odd way of seeing things. Mark Twain was standing in a city that had been scouted by a Neapolitan mercenary, named by a Russian empress, governed by her one-eyed secret husband, built by two exiled French noblemen, modernized by a Cambridge-educated count and celebrated by his wife's Russian lover. __EOS__ Odessa was a city that would witness both the glory and the depravity of the 20th century, a place where gangsters and shysters and revolutionaries and writers all mingled. __EOS__ Genius and Death in a City of Dreams.""

50736," In the high school, the Hispanic kids complained that they were constantly harassed. They were physically separated from the other groups. So therefore, when the kids who were not Hispanics had to walk through to the gym, for example, that's when they came in contact. And they would push them out of the way or they would say derogatory things like, you know, dumb in a can for Dominican, or go back to Mexico or es-speak, I mean, all kinds of derogatory terms, really, really ugly that made them feel bad. And apparently, even at the school level, no one knew this was going on.__EOS__ Something else that was kind of wild is that one of these teenagers involved in the attack himself was Hispanic.__EOS__ Yes. Jose Pacheco was - his mother is African-American and his father is Puerto Rican. A lot of people are thrown by that. I was not, though, because I think it is possible to assign humanity to people we know and like and not so to the rest of the people that we don't know.__EOS__ That old, like, you're one of the good ones, that thing?",0

The avenue rises in the burley districts of downtown where rage against the unbelievers is nurtured and sustained every Friday at prayers; and it ascends, mile by mile, till it reaches the heights of Jamaran, where one might think - to look at the Parisian fashions and big German cars -that the unbelievers are everywhere. But that is wrong. Nothing along this avenue is quite what it appears to be. That is the warning, and the temptation. __EOS__ David Ignatius takes on that temptation in his novel, ""The Increment."" He tells the story of Western intelligence agencies tracking an Iranian nuclear scientist.

50749," Let me quote something that - someone you described as a frustrated Obama fundraiser, something they told you. They said that creating a sense of intimacy with the president is especially important with Democratic donors. Unlike Republicans, they have no business interest being furthered by the donation. They just like to be involved. It's like if you're not going to deregulate my industry or lower my taxes, can't I at least get a picture with the president?__EOS__ Well, yes. And this issue of getting pictures with the president actually was one of the first subjects that really set the Obama White House on a rough course with the big donors. The Democratic donors want to feel involved. And one of the things that everybody loves is to have a picture of themselves in the sort of classic grip-and-grin with the president at the holiday parties at the end of the year. They have them for both Christmas and Hanukah now.__EOS__ Another thing along the kind of schmoozing line, and this is a story you tell early in your New Yorker article  It's a story about a fundraising dinner at a Four Seasons hotel. Would you tell the story?__EOS__ Well, yeah. It was a dinner where a number of Wall Street titans were coming. They were people who had supported Obama in 2008, but by 2010, they were feeling a little miffed. They felt that the Obama administration was not expressing enough admiration for Wall Street.",3
50750," Gretchen Morgenson's book with Joshua Rosner is called ""Reckless Endangerment  How Outsized Ambition, Greed and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon."" She'll be back in the second half of the show. I'm Dave Davies and this is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, back with New York Times financial writer Gretchen Morgenson. She's written a new book with Joshua Rosner about the origins of the financial crisis called ""Reckless Endangerment  How Outsized Ambition, Greed, and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon."" Much of the book focuses on the government-backed mortgage giant Fannie Mae. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration sought to expand home ownership among poor and working Americans. Morgenson writes that there was a push supported by Fannie Mae to relax lending standards so more people could get home mortgages. __EOS__ This was really the first step in subprime lending. I mean, there always had been a subprime lending category for people who didn't quite, you know, have, maybe, the documentation. Perhaps they were borrowers who had uneven income. You know, maybe they were a doctor who only, you know, earned based on surgical procedures. There were many people who had uneven income levels, and those were not what we now think of as subprime. But they were the kinds of people who had to really persuade the bank that, yes, they could afford to pay this monthly mortgage, even though their income, you know, sort of was volatile and rose at fell and wasn't sort of, you know, a constant, as is the case of most people. __EOS__ And the other thing that we saw a few years later was Wall Street firms taking a lot of these riskier loans, those more likely to default, packaging them together in securities, which they would then sell to investors. Was Fannie Mae doing that in these early days of this effort? Were they buying riskier loans from mortgage lenders and then making securities out of them? ",0
50751," Well, I think that's debatable, Neal. I don't know that the American public would accept that. And there was a complicating feature that very soon after our victory, when we were viewed as omnipotence, then all of a sudden they found out that the country that put a man on the moon couldn't get the electricity working. And so we started to show a chink in our armor. And then there was Iraqis that were sitting on the fence about what had happened, delighted Sadam Hussein was gone, but now wondering what these Americans were going to bring. And then they started to get an attitude contrary to what they considered our occupation. And we probably would've exacerbated the problem at a certain point by sending more troops there. The window of opportunity was there in those initial months, weeks, right after the fall of Sadam Hussein. __EOS__ That period of time, the war itself, the planning for the conflict, all described in a new book called COBRA II  the Inside Story of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq. Its authors are Michael Gordon and General Bernard Trainor, who were both kind enough to join us today here in Studio 3-A.

50752," One last point here, which is that when President Bush made a statement today in accepting the resignation, he talked about some of the good things that Alberto Gonzales did. And the list included participating in the writing of the Patriot Act, his handling of terrorism, stopping child pornography in the country, civil rights, aggressive pursuit of public corruption, gang violence, confirmation of two people to the Supreme Court -Roberts and Alito. Would you agree with that as a list of the good that Alberto Gonzales did? __EOS__ I think I would readily agree, and most other people in the department. Even long-term career people would readily agree that there are some good things there. But it's not even a matter of the glass being half empty versus half full. I think the glass is only partially full there because there is so many negatives associated with Attorney General Gonzales' appearance before the Congress this year and the way that he handled or mishandled so many things with contradictory statements and faulty recollections, or total inexplicable lack of recollections. __EOS__ Let's get some listeners involved in the conversation, 800-989-8255.

I think ""What Death Leaves Behind"" is intended to be a pretty euphoric song.

I've tried to make sure that when I sat down and exercise that particular craft that I served the true master, which is, of course, the audience and the audience that I grew up with, the neighborhood crowd that I grew up with who are now in my age group, my demographic, 50 to 70 years old.

So tell us a little bit about her and her eventual relationship with Yip Man.__EOS__ She's a very strong lady. You know, in the old days in China, females were not allowed to learn kung fu, but Gong Er's father taught her secretly and she became a grandmaster. Her father not only taught her physical skills, but more importantly, she learned how to be herself, know herself and do what she feels is right. So for the character, when she first time met Yip Man, I think they fall in love immediately because they had a huge fight, but that fight at the end, somehow, it becomes very romantic. I call the scene love at first fight.__EOS__ I have to say, it is a beautiful scene. The fight choreography is gorgeous. And I understand you were a ballet dancer?",1

And he was like, no, this is, like, a big deal. Like, we've got like development money to make this show, and we have to, like, change the script, so we have to, like, talk to them. It's, like, a big deal. And I just sort of laughed it off.__EOS__ But you were able to make the changes?",3
50770," Absolutely both. Both from the perspective of their parents didn't have access, or their parents didn't learn how to swim and so then they passed down those fears, and they passed down their stereotypes to their children. And so when these students were growing up, and we're talking students from all over the United States, that learning how to swim just was not a priority. __EOS__ And speaking of negative experiences, last summer, during the 2008 Olympics Games in Beijing, Cullen Jones, an African-American, won a gold medal in the 4 x 100 freestyle relay, along with of course Michael Phelps, the huge swimming star. I just want to play a short clip where he describes an experience that he had as a child. Do we have that? I'd like to play it. Here it is. __EOS__ I was five years old and we were at Donnie Park in Pennsylvania. And there was a huge inner tube ride. And at the bottom of the ride was a pool water and I ended up flipping upside down and passed out and the lifeguard and my dad had to come in and save me and give me a resuscitation. But when I woke up, I was like, yeah, all right, what's the next ride we're getting on? My mom still kind of cringes when I tell the story. __EOS__ And he goes on to say that his mother enrolled him in swimming classes the very next week. But I wanted to ask, is that a common experience? Or if maybe a kid has one bad experience and that's it. ",3
50771,"  Billy, we've already told me off. Let's move on.__EOS__  You're tacky, and I hate you.__EOS__  OK, you see me after class. You, Gordon.__EOS__  No allowance.",1
50772," Well, that's obviously from the trailer. __EOS__ So tell us a little bit more about the film. __EOS__ Absolutely. Well, ""West Is West"" is the sequel to the 1999 film ""East Is East"" and stars the legendary Om Puri. And the child in the film or the kid is played by Aqib Khan, who will be in attendance at our festival. And it's an amazing film. It's charming. What we really like about it is that it deals with a lot of issues that we deal with within our communities, which include immigration, mixed-raced families, generational issues and assimilation in different countries. __EOS__ Well, it's also kind of one of those classic coming-of-age stories... ",1
50773," Were you exposed to a lot of comics who did? __EOS__ I was exposed to a lot of comics who did. There was - you know, there's definitely a correlation between people who want to perform and people who want to meet the crowd and have sex with them. There's definitely a lot of sexual energy in the comedy clubs. Do not chat with the comedians after the show, people. You'll put yourself in a dangerous situation. __EOS__ But you seem to be fascinated by the kinds of guys who are more brazen and who talk about sex all the time and brag about it, whether they know what they're talking about or not. __EOS__ Yes. I find that endlessly funny. I don't think it's healthy. I find all sexuality really, really hilarious. You know, it always made me laugh that if you're young, and you walk up to a woman and you say hello, on some level, the code is I'm interested in you. And if she says hello and keeps talking to you, she's - in code - saying okay, we can continue to talk because there's a chance maybe I could like you at some point. ",1
50774," Well, thank you. __EOS__ No, it was a completely organic moment. I was talking to a couple of young people. And these were, you know, people in their late teens, early 20s, who were members of Eddie Long's congregation. All of them sort of alluded to what they thought was the bishop didn't look like an abuser or a pedophile or a molester. __EOS__ What happened after that? When you got off the air that day, did you say to yourself, what have I done - or what? __EOS__ Well, it was - you know how people are constantly talking in your ear, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, you know, camera two and then I'm going to turn you to three or whatever. Silence for the rest of the show. I think people were stunned. My executive producer didn't say anything. And then after the show, I walked out and everybody's, like, eh. And then he said, did you know you were going to say what's going on? I was, like, no, I didn't. And I didn't think it was going to be a big deal? ",0
50775,"  Ooh. __EOS__  ...responsibility do the parents have? __EOS__  That's a good question.  No one's asked me to look at      it from that perspective.  If I'm going to do it, I'll tell you very      honestly--and again, I can only base it off of my own personal      experience. Fifty percent of it is the parent; 50 percent of what happens      to that child's education starts in the home and ends in the home.  Let      me tell you why, because over the life of that child's education, from      pre-K through 12th grade, do you know how much time is actually spent in      the classroom?  Nine percent.  Ninety-one percent is spent in the home,      out on the street, in the neighborhood, in the community, in an      environment where parents have more sway, OK.  So you, as a parent, I      think have to step up and be a little bit more engaged because that kid      is only going to have 9 percent of that academic life touched by a      teacher. __EOS__  Well, what about the kids who are not blessed with good      parents? ",3
50776," Absolutely. This is one of the things that really probably surprised me most during the research for the book, actually, is the way that children were treated after the war. And children of Germans were treated terribly by their local communities. I mean, they were shunned. They were, you know, ridiculed in school. In some cases, there's anecdotal stories about some of these infants being killed by resistance members.__EOS__ But they were never deported.__EOS__ They were never deported, because they couldn't find any legal way of doing it, and they couldn't find anyone who was willing to take them on. But in Norway, these children were not given Norwegian citizenship until they were 18 years old. So every year, their mothers had to take them to the police station to register them as kind of like an enemy alien living in our midst. Imagine the humiliation of that every year until you're 18.__EOS__ Keith Lowe will be back in the second half of the show. He's the author of ""Savage Continent  Europe in the Aftermath of World War II."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.",0
50777," It was it great. It was inspiring, really. I mean he would get up in front of all these people and kind of just get lost in the moment as well, and I think that's where I take not that I'm saying he was really standing up there acting, but he would just really get lost into these stories. He would speak, and it was fun to watch and to hear. And, you know, I left at such a young age. I left...__EOS__ Left Idaho and left home?__EOS__ Left Idaho. Yeah, I left Idaho at 17. You know, I graduated high school a year early and just, you know, the typical story, packed up my car and moved out. Yeah.__EOS__ I wonder if there was any pressure on you to be the good kid because you were like the son of the minister. And if so, if acting was a kind of like release valve for that because you could be all the people that you weren't allowed to be.",3
50778," ""Ribbon in the Sky"" by Stevie Wonder.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__  Oh, so long for this night I prayed that a star would guide you my way...__EOS__ And you remember exactly the song that was playing as he stepped out onto the ice.",2
50779,"  Yeah, that. What you got on?__EOS__  This is a very, very, very nice suit.__EOS__  That's a very, very, very nice suit, huh?__EOS__  That's a clown suit. That's a costume...",1
50780,"  Do the answers change through the years? __EOS__  Yeah.  I'm interested in finding out if I'm evolving. I      don't want to feel the same way at 53 that I felt at 43.  I would like to      think that as a result of not just my own experiences, but at least being      empathetic and compassionate about other people's experiences and plights      and tragedies, that I am affected by it and learn from it.  Because I      would prefer to think of my life as being--I want to be worthy.  I don't      want to just do things to be gratuitous.  You know, you don't write books      just to be famous.  I mean, you can't predict that.  And if I'm going to      spend time and energy writing about people, I would prefer that they be      black and that they have problems that are real and that, instead of      running from their problems, that they try to face them.  Even if they      don't succeed.  But the fact that they have the courage to try to face      them is what to me is important. __EOS__  Give us a thumbnail sketch of the book. __EOS__  Leon, is Marilyn's husband.  I think they're both 44 or 45      years old.  The kids--they have twin sons who go to Morehouse and a      daughter who's a grad student at Cal--the story takes place in Northern      California. And I wanted her husband, to be successful, you know.  As      women would say, `a good catch.' But you know, Leon's a little boring.      And Marilyn's a little overweight and the kids are out of the house.  And      then there's the mother-in-law, Ms. Arthurine, whom I love.  Love, love,      love.  Because people are all--grandparents are always quoting from the      Bible.  And I was wondering what would happen if they get it wrong?  But      also, I was interested in having elderly people show affection for each      other. ",0
50781," I love it. Yeah, because it's a chance to play the music that you're playing in a very, very focused way. I mean, don't get me wrong, there's nothing can substitute for a live performance. And, really, in jazz, I think it's a live performance where the music really becomes complete because it's a music of improvisation, of spontaneity, you're in the moment, you're interacting with other musicians, with the audience. __EOS__ Your father, Dewey Redman, plays tenor sax with you on ""India"" on the album but he died before this album came out. He had a surprise for you, though, ""GJ."" Tell us about that tune. __EOS__ Yeah. Well, originally, dad and I were only supposed to play one tune together. And in fact, we did only play one tune together. We played ""India."" And it went pretty well, we did a few takes, and we're both were pretty happy with it. And I was, like, okay, time to move on. Thanks for coming in, dad. __EOS__ And I said how did it go? He said, great, one take. And I didn't even listened to it at that time because we were, kind of, running behind. The session had to move forward, but he said, you know, the name of the song is ""GJ."" It stands for grandson Jaden. Jaden is my son's name. And he was born in February of 2006. We recorded in May of 2006. And my father had met him one time in April, and it turned that it was the only time my father had met him. ",2
50782," Yeah. It happens and the jewelry stores led the way at this. Other retailers are doing it now, as well, but smart shoppers are going to buy jewelry in January for Valentine's Day gifts.__EOS__ One of the other surprises that I learned from your book is that January and February is a good time to buy a prom dress. Now, why would that be?__EOS__ Yeah. Who's thinking...__EOS__ I don't need one, but you know - but thank you for asking, but...",0
50783," The co-pilot, yeah, extremely competent pilots - as most airline pilots are. I mean, people  these people live and breathe airplanes year in and year out. They know the machines. They understand the sky and flying to an extent that the public cannot even imagine. So, would this accident  would this accident have been so successful had Sullenberger and Skiles been in a conventional airplane like a Boeing 737? I think so. I mean, I have no reason to believe that they would not have performed as well in a measurable sense. So, the affect of fly-by-wire on this particular story is not directly that very simple thing  oh, they didnt crash because of a fly-by-wire. __EOS__ Another paradox, you say, the air  the pilot business has become pretty difficult in the last several decades, 20 years in particular, between the deregulation of the airlines and loss of salary, cutbacks and loss of pensions and any number of other things - yet you also point out that while much of the glamour and excitement and interest has gone out of the job, theres no shortage of people lining up to do it. __EOS__ Thats right. I mean, people dont become pilots  I, maybe years past, people became pilots because they - it was  they thought it was glamorous. I mean, I think up close it never really was. I mean, I dont think many pilots have really believed that, even during the glamour days of the 50s or before. Maybe in the 20s they did and they were regularly dying for that glamour back then in 27, 28, 29, the early airmail  early airlines, but, you know, no pilots arent pursuing glamour and theyre not really pursuing money either. __EOS__ by what motivates you. Im pretty sure its not the money. So, it  you know, it is to say that  and this came up in the story. I mean, to say that because pilots are making less money now, they therefore  the public has therefore less safe is a highly questionable assertion. Of course, if it went on for long time and people were making only, sort of, poverty wages, then you would find the negative selection going on. But were not at that stage. ",0
50784," The courts have shied away from saying anything derogatory, putting any firm hand on the matter of partisan redistricting. Now what they do say is that you can't just wantonly cut up districts. You certainly can't to, in a way that's going to dilute minority voting strength, it's going to retrogress. But there other things that have been said on this as well. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor had said in a Supreme Court decision that appearances do matter in the case of the redistricting. And thus, it said that districts should have a certain is compactness, a contiguity and respect for political subdivision, that you can't just run right through precincts wantonly.__EOS__ OK. So districts need to be somewhat compact. They need to kind of keep communities whole when possible. But there's no outright stricture on using the boundaries to help a political party.__EOS__ There is not.__EOS__ Seems so strange. Because, you know, in other spheres, you know, we rely upon independent arbiter. I mean when we have a legal dispute there's a court and it sort of you don't have the parties having private conversations with the judge or changing the rules. And in athletic competitions we count on umpires to be fair. And we don't have redrawing the strike zones or the foul lines to help their side. This is a really kind of odd exception, isn't it?",0
50785, It was a hot July. The soldiers were returning from Europe and...__EOS__ Looking for jobs.__EOS__ ...a lot of the jobs had been taken by the influx of African-American workers...__EOS__ This I - we're in the middle of The Great Migration.,0
50786," That's right. And, you know, Coach Bowden is doing a good enough job of losing ground of Paterno anyway, just given the fact that his team is struggling so much right now. But, yeah, sadly enough, that has taken, you know, front and center of this case, these 14 victories that Bobby Bowden stands to lose. __EOS__ You know, we tried to get people from the university, including the president, to talk about this and they declined. Have they been tightlipped with you at the Sentinel or other reporters in Florida trying to get information from them? __EOS__ They've been extremely tightlipped, especially within the past year or so. I think there was a time early on in this case - this case broke publicly back in September of 2007 when, I think, university officials were more receptive about talking about it. I, in fact, spoke with President Wetherell for an extended amount of time in January of '08. And I think basically they're in shutdown mode right now. Really, there haven't been many interview availabilities throughout this whole deal. __EOS__ Well, Reporter Andrew Carter of the Orlando Sentinel, thanks a lot for taking with us. ",3
50787,"  No one asks about our father, sister or mother. All they ever ask is what's up with your brother?__EOS__ That's Dave Alvin's song, ""What's Up With Your Brother?"" on Dave's album, ""Eleven Eleven,"" and Phil Alvin is featured on that too. They have a new album called, ""Common Ground"", featuring them performing songs by the great blues man, Big Bill Broonzy. So Dave, what do you mean by what's up with your brother? Like, why does everybody ask you that?__EOS__ Well, they ask Phil that too. You know, it's kind of a running joke that - the song I wrote in Madison, Wisconsin. Because I was playing a great club there - I won't mention the name - but the drawback to play in that club is they don't have a bathroom backstage. So right before I went on, I went up through the crowd, into the bathroom, and I'm standing there doing my business and the guy comes stands next to me and looks over and says hey, what's up with your brother?__EOS__ .",2
50788," Thank you very much. I'm happy to be here. __EOS__ What is the single most compelling reason for a person of Evangelical faith to vote for Senator McCain over Senator Obama? __EOS__ Well, I think there are several issues, and I think there's a mistake that one issue is preeminent. But if there was going to be an issue, it'll probably be the life issue. But I think then, there's also the issue of marriage, and the definition of marriage. And Senator McCain brings some unique focus, I think, to the Evangelical community. They should - both the senator and his compassion for all people being God's children, plus the issues that he holds dear in his heart, I think, are a perfect fit not only for what I call movement conservatives, but also for the young Evangelical population, which is a kind of new in this year's election. __EOS__ Let me quote Tom Minnery. He's a senior vice president with Focus on the Family, interviewed by Christianity Today Magazine during the Republican Convention. On the question of Senator McCain as a candidate, Mr. Minnery calls him ""inconsistent on the abortion issue, given his view of the stem cell research side of it."" That's a quote. ",3
50789," When I got there for the year to do that research, he was my main collaborator and contact to meet other musicians. And I spent a lot of time with him. So we got to know each other's ways of playing music. __EOS__ And they decided to make a record together. Eagleson's partner in a band called Golden flew to Nairobi for the session. Guitarist Alex Minoff says there was no time for rehearsal. They taught the drummer the songs the night before. __EOS__ We had tracks of drums from things that Ian had recorded prior to that. So we played him these recordings of our music with his drumming on them. And he kind of listened to each song and he kind of — he had a couple of pencils and he tapped them on the table. And it was like, okay. So I'll see you guys tomorrow. __EOS__ Minoff says the studio was the nightclub where Otieno Jagwasi sang in the house band. ",2
50790," Yeah! __EOS__...to break the ice? __EOS__ Right, exactly. __EOS__  When Jesus gives my portion, My constant friend is He... ",3
50791," Because they were too direct? __EOS__ Yes, and maybe not for the public. __EOS__ One of the benefits of digital recording technology is how much you can do on your own. But this album definitely does not sound like a one-man band. With virtually unlimited tracks, you can record and record and record and then make a lot of decisions about a song's final arrangement when you're mixing down all those elements. __EOS__ I really just record everything that I could possibly think of, and then when it came to mix, I would almost treat it like a block of stone and then, you know, cut things out of it to make it what it was. ",2
50792," As hard as that may be to believe. But in fact, it did. And whats striking is that this idea that we are now living at the end of time, and that current events are showing us fulfillments of Biblical prophecy - exactly the same thing was being said 10 years ago about things happening 10 years ago -and 10 years before that, and 10 years before that, and 10 years before that. You can go all the way back in Christian history, and every decade thought that they were living at the end of time, and that the prophecies were being fulfilled in their own day. __EOS__ Bart Ehrman, speaking to Terry Gross. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ Let's get back to Terry's 2009 interview with Bible scholar Bart Ehrman. His book ""Jesus, Interrupted"" is now out in paperback. __EOS__ How did the historical approach to reading the Bible affect your faith? You know, youve told us before that you had been a devout, evangelical Christian. You studied at the Moody Bible Institute. Then you went to Princeton Theological Seminary and there, undertook a historical reading of the Bible, as opposed to a devotional one. So what impact did the historical reading of the Bible and seeing the contradictions - many more contradictions than youve been telling us about today, you know, from one Gospel to another - how did that affect your faith? ",0
50793," I had changed very much. You know, there was this little boy called Miguel who was working with his father. He was a mason. And the incredible thing was that he had not had a chance to have a library like mine. Because of the Pinochet dictatorship, his fate would be to be uneducated. He was not going to be able to grow up to have these books or the possibility of these books, you know? And in fact, I was in - at the L.A. Library last night reading, and I was thinking about all the Miguels in Los Angeles and all the Miguels in the United States who should have a chance to go to the library and have their own identity cards even if their parents are undocumented, that they know they have the desire of that and the possibility of that.  __EOS__ And then I thought to myself, he's gone, and I won't see him again, and where - what's going to happen to this boy? What happens to all the lost children? So there's a lost library and there's the lost children, and someday, I can only pray, you know, that there will be no more lost libraries and no more lost children. __EOS__ We're talking with Ariel Dorfman about the library that he left behind when he went into exile. Exiles, what did you leave behind that still calls to you? 800-989-8255, email, talk@npr.org. And Nico is on the line with us from San Francisco. __EOS__ Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my call, Neal.  ",0
50794," Just say no. People need to realize that if you have a bank account and you file your taxes electronically, the Federal government, the IRS, will rebate your money in typically 10 days. __EOS__ Ten days? __EOS__ That's all it is, 10 days. So people will file for these refund anticipation loans so they can get their money in two days. If they were willing to wait merely eight more days, then they would get that refund with no charges associated with whatsoever. __EOS__ And how typically are these loans administered? What do you do? Do you take your tax refund to like one of these payday lenders or something of that sort? Is that how it happens? ",3
50795," She opens a clinic and illegal, you know, it's a direct action, right. She's hoping to get arrested. She writes to the Brooklyn district attorney before she opens the clinic saying hey, I'm about to open a clinic, and what I'm going to do there is tell women about birth control.__EOS__ nothing.__EOS__ You know, and that judge who made it legal for her to open her clinic, who said that doctors could prescribe contraception for women, also said that no woman, quote, had the right to copulate with a feeling of security that there will be no resulting conception. How was that interpreted?__EOS__ Well, one - people ask all the time. Actually, when I've been chatting with people about, oh, I'm working on this history of contraception - people are always quite surprised at the virulence of the social disapproval of contraception itself.",3
50796," They'll come - in some instances, they come from the contractor. So, for example, if you're Northrop Grumman and you're building a secret airplane, you might make a patch for all the people who are working on that secret airplane and distribute it to them. If you are a black Air Force unit, the military's going to issue some patch, and you probably won't like that patch very much. And so the people in your unit and you will get together and create your own patch and then try to get a permission to wear it, and sometimes you'll be able to wear these things on Friday. __EOS__ You brought a couple of patches with you here to the studio. Can you decipher one or two for me? __EOS__ These are a little bit tricky. One of these is kind of fun. __EOS__ Yes, I like it. ",0
50797," I can answer that question by telling you sort of how I came to write this story. And I grew up outside of Charleston, South Carolina and we had a lot of cats and as a result, a lot of wounded animals. __EOS__  Well, dead birds. __EOS__ Mostly birds. And I'd take it upon myself to - every one I found, I would try and rescue one. I kept them all in this little rabbit hutch I had in the backyard, and it never really ended well. And I sort of came to realize that maybe they were on their own path and no matter what I did, I couldn't change it. __EOS__ Do you find that the exercise - I mean, your story had 596 words, right? Just under 600. Did you have to slash big chunks of it out? ",0
50798," Just off a little bit.__EOS__ Yeah, just enough to make it deeply unsettling, and I think that this particular piece of public art captures that really well.__EOS__  I walked over the bridge in Milwaukee past the statue of Fonz in the dark. With the wind kicking in and the sparrows around in the mud.__EOS__ I started writing about this day that we had walked around and seen the Bronz Fonz and also there was a big bronze duck, which was also bizarre...",2
50799," Unless he's at the store working. Yeah, Sparky.__EOS__ Unless he's in the store working. Right. Exactly.__EOS__ I mean, honestly, sometimes Karen will call me and say it doesn't matter if you can come in but we really need to see Sparky. A lot of people have been coming into the store. He hasn't been to work for a couple of days. And I'll drive over and drop him off and go home and go back to work.__EOS__ Ann Patchett, thank you so much for coming on FRESH AIR. It's really just been great to talk with you. I really enjoyed it.",0
50800," Not in the case of ""Pina."" Millions of people have seen the film now in 3-D. It's been very successful. Also in America, we're playing on 40 cities. And in the beginning, when we came out in Europe about a year ago, now already, we also prepared lots of mono prints, regular prints, because we were quite - not quite sure if cineplexes were going to play this movie.__EOS__ Let's play another excerpt. This is another piece you set outdoors with a hippopotamus, somebody playing a hippopotamus, in a hippopotamus suit, in the water, and the dancer, Josephine Ann Endicott.__EOS__ All of her pieces were about love and pain and beauty and sorrow and loneliness. When I had this love affair with the hippopotamus, I was about 28 when I did that piece. I even indentified her with this big sweet hippo monster. I was trying to understand her, figure out why she had to keep working, and working, and working, and working, and always working, and working...__EOS__ And we can hear - well, this - it's funny, of course, but this film is also about grief.",1
50801," They did. They sure did. Yeah - the raw immediacy of it.__EOS__ Let's close with another track from your new album, ""Musette Explosion."" And there's a song that you do on it called ""Douce Joie,"" which means sweet joy. And one of the things I really like about this track is that, you know, the trio is made up of you on accordion, Matt Munisteri on guitar and sometimes banjo, and Marcus Rojas on tuba. And I don't think you associate tuba with French musette.__EOS__ That's right. Yeah. It's not a part of the traditional style, but...__EOS__ Nor do I associate it with accordion - with any accordion style.",2
50802,"  Oh, I think it would be bad.  I mean, I think that within      the short term, it would provoke a lot of anti-American attacks and in      the longer term, it would really--I mean, he's already a pretty large      figure.  I think it would pump him up even more.  If you think about      Sayyid Qutb, who is really the ideological godfather of this movement who      was executed in 1966, it was his, quote, unquote, ""martyrdom"" that really      turned him in--as much as his writings, that turned him into a very      significant figure.  And bin Laden is a much more well-known person than      Sayyid Qutb, and I think in death, he would take on even greater presence      than in life.  And that's not just my opinion; it's the opinion of a      number of people who know him and that I interviewed in the book. __EOS__  Is there any--what about the fact that unlike Qutb, Osama bin      Laden doesn't have his body of printed work to live after him? __EOS__  Well, I mean, he's got a lot of statements.  I mean, we've      got, you know--by the way, there have been 18 videotapes and audiotapes      from bin Laden since 9/11.  And one of the questions you asked--I think      it was implicit--was, `Well, why is he even important now?'  And my      argument would be, `Look, these videotapes and audiotapes which have been      released--you know, 18 of them since 9/11--have, you know, broad,      pump-up-the-base kind of messages--kill Westerners, kill Jews'--and they      also sometimes have specific instructions.  For instance, `Attack members      of the coalition in Iraq.'  Well, we saw the attack in Spain. __EOS__  Mm-hmm. ",0
50803," So just some quick math here, translated that's about 23 years left. __EOS__ It's approximately 23 years. So the government says that I should croak when I'm 78.68 years. __EOS__ Well, 23 years, that sounds a lot longer than 8,497 days. __EOS__ I think when you translate some times into the kind of units that we're familiar with and we work with, it changes the picture. Do you realize that the Web is only about 5,000 days old? ",3
50804," Al-Qaida in Iraq as we call it, AQI. __EOS__ And what accounts for that? You said that they're basically  region. __EOS__ The biggest catalyst that occurred, which happened in the fall of last year, were the Anbaris themselves, the Sunni Iraqis of Anbar province. They basically got fed up with AQI, al-Qaida in Iraq. They saw that all al-Qaida was offering was effectively death and destruction for them. And I can understand from the Anbaris, they're saying, okay, we're not particularly thrilled with the U.S. presence per se, but what do the Americans offer? __EOS__ Mr. Ureta, the image that you painted for us of darting in and out of buildings trying to avoid the gunfire there is quite vivid. I'm wondering beyond the diplomatic corps, what life is like for average Iraqis who lived in this region? ",3
50805," Yeah, and that really brought about a little bit of a train wreck. As I say, I went in there full pheromone and... __EOS__ I really got the punishment. Yeah, I think it also showed me, again, the difference between male and female friendships and how they begin and of course how they develop over time. I think women tend to fly into new friendships. If you meet someone you like, there's no, there aren't those same barriers of communication and touch and expression. So, you know, I was treating this friendship the way I would as a woman. And he of course was seeing me as a man and that signal, I was not giving him the appropriate signals, and he just cut me off after a couple of days, he just, he wouldn't talk to me anymore. __EOS__ And... __EOS__ And it became very clear that he just said, this is not appropriate. And of course I discussed it with him later and I think he thought that I was gay and that I was falling in love with him when in fact I just had a sort of a girlish friend crush on him. ",0
50806,  What?__EOS__  I love you.__EOS__  How do you expect me to respond to this?__EOS__  How about you love me too?,1
50807," Wouldn't it be good? ""Room With a View 2."" Both of us are talking down here. Hello.__EOS__ Hello, Cecil.__EOS__ So apart from speaking deeper now...__EOS__ Yes.",1
50808, ...for spending so much time with us. __EOS__ You got enough? __EOS__ I have. __EOS__ I'm enjoying this. ,1
50809," The sermon on the day of the blast, as I understand, was entitled, ""The Love that Forgives."" __EOS__ Yeah, I heard that, even though there wasn't a sermon that day. __EOS__ There wasn't a sermon? __EOS__ No, it was in - the bombing happened between Sunday school and sermon time. ",3
50810," That's for sure. You know, as the baby boomers hit their 60s, social service agencies are being stretched to their limits to help such a large and growing group of people. Does the foundation feel some of that pinch, trying to help these folks too?  __EOS__ Well, absolutely. You know, there is never enough to make up for all of the injustices that have happened to a lot of these artists. Some of it self-inflicted, but a great deal of it, inflicted just by virtue of - here's one of my favorite stories, is a lady by the name of LaVerne Baker, who wrote a song called Roll with me Henry, all right baby.  Roll with me Henry.  __EOS__ Now how is the foundation able to help them? What do you do for them? __EOS__ Well, what we do most of all is to get them to come to our event. They are just so glad that somebody remembers them, somebody cared about them. Then we have been able to get them medical services when they have run out of funds, and that takes us to a political thing. Now we start talking about universal health care, we could go on that for a long, long time.  ",2
50811,"  And I'm still dipping on it. See, I'm not walking on it, or trying to run around it. This ain't no acrobatics. You either follow or you lead. Yeah, I'm talking... __EOS__ Janelle Monae, all the best to you. Thanks so much for coming in. __EOS__ Thank you, Michele. It was my pleasure. __EOS__  I can't complain about it. I got to keep my balance and just keep dancing on it. We're getting funky on the scene. And you know about it. Like a star on the screen. Watch me tip all on it... ",2
50812," Of course, you include a song from ""Porgy and Bess,"" 1935. I have to ask first, I was expecting it to be ""Summertime.""__EOS__ Yes. ""Summertime"" is so well documented and covered, and so I really wanted to explore something else from ""Porgy and Bess."" And it wasn't easy to choose one piece because it is truly Gershwin's masterwork, something that he claimed that he would be remembered for, even though ""Porgy and Bess"" was a failure in his own lifetime. So, I chose ""I Got Plenty of Nothing.""__EOS__  I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me.__EOS__  ...as the things that I prize like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I got plenty of nothing...",0
50813," And I don't know if anyone else will get this, but it's kind of, you know, when all else fails, you can always, you know, go somewhere else and start anew. __EOS__  Heading westwards toward the sun Situations from the last come undone. We were lost from the start. We won't be here when the rest falls apart Oh, I can tell your words, so well... __EOS__ It can be refreshing to talk to a young artist that hasn't done dozens of interviews and refined his bio-patter. Nathan was almost shamefaced when talking about his own abilities as a lyricist. __EOS__ I don't usually try to write too specific. I mean, I'd love to be Bruce Springsteen or Bob Dylan, but I'm kind of a bit more ambiguous. ",2
50814," You know, I stumbled into it a bit. I was a foreign correspondent in Berlin in the mid-'90s. I was born in Munich; my father was an army officer. So I always had an interest in both the war and in European politics and European warfare. I found that it got into my imagination in a way. The characters are fantastic. The stresses of war reveal character. You can see what they're made of. You can test their mettle because their mettle's being tested under the most adverse stresses of combat.__EOS__ Were you daunted at all by the immense pile of books that had been written before yours about every phase of this war?__EOS__ Of course it's daunting. I think Amazon.com lists 60,000 hardcovers on World War II. So that is a daunting thing. On the other hand, I think the greatest events in human history are really bottomless. So for World War II, the archive is stupendous. The U.S. Army records alone for World War II weigh 17,000 tons, and even the best historians have not done more than just scratch the surface. The story is such that 500 years from now people will be writing and reading about it.__EOS__ Is there a way in which this story feels like it's still with us? I mean, it's a lifetime away from us now and yet it still feels very present.",0
50815," The BBC Archives,"" that includes transcriptions of their BBC radio and TV interviews, as well as fascinating BBC internal memos about The Beatles and their music.__EOS__ Live at the BBC.""__EOS__ It's The Beatles.__EOS__  If there's anything that you want, if there's anything we can do, just call on us, and we'll send it along with love from us to you, to you, to you, to you.",2
50816," And I had never heard music like that. I was very, very young, maybe five or six years old. But the sound of it it was just mesmerizing to me. There were groups before that, namely The Boswell Sisters, who really sort of set the bar for girl groups. And The Andrews Sisters followed the Boswell's. The Chordettes followed The Andrews Sisters.__EOS__  I'm going to walk right up to him, give him a great big kiss, tell him that I love him, tell him that I care, tell him that I'll always be there. Well, what color are his eyes? I don't know. He's always wearing shades. Is he tall? Well, I've got to look up. Yeah? Well, I hear he's bad. Oh, he's good bad but he's not evil. Tell me more.__EOS__ You know, it's funny. I was listening to those and I kept saying they remind me of something. They remind me of something. What is it? What is it? And then I realized it's got the same kind of upbeat, fun vibe to it that ""Hairspray"" did. And then I realized that your musical collaborator is Marc Shaiman, who worked on ""Hairspray.""__EOS__ Yes, he wrote ""Hairspray"" with his partner, Scott Wittman. And he's an old friend of mine. He came to me when he was 16 years old. He knocked on my door and he said you don't know me, but I'm a musical prodigy, or words to that affect.",2
50817," But the - it comes in stages many times, and I describe later, later in the book, I go to ""Tapestry,"" and I actually sort of share some what I call memory snapshots of what it was like to record ""Tapestry."" And one of the things that I do back in the songwriting day and later when I was an artist is things do come to me, and often I don't know what the next thing is going to be until I lay down the first thing.__EOS__ Why don't you layer your voice?__EOS__ So I want to play a demo that I think is particularly interesting, and so I'm going to play ""Take Good Care of My Baby"" and then play the hit version by Bobby Vee. So the hit version was from 1961, and you demoed it just before that. So here's Carole King, followed by Bobby Vee.__EOS__  My tears are falling because you're taken her away, and though it really hurts me so, there's something that I've gotta say. Take good care of my baby. Please don't ever make her blue. Just tell her that you love her, make sure you're thinking of her in everything you say and do....",2
50818," Let me ask you something to follow up on this. It strikes me that one of the more interesting kind of news developments in the past couple years around corruption on the continent has been the role of Swiss bankers in shielding these assets, and now they're trying to create some transparency in their own banking system. What needs to happen--do you have any theories about what needs to happen in terms of places to hide the money?  If there's all this money being skimmed from various governments, there's got to be places to hide it. Will there eventually be some ways to prevent this kind of large scale corruption from being feasible in a banking system? __EOS__ That's a very good question. I think that the experience of the Swiss banking sector, as a result of the manner in which the resources of the Holocaust victims were used by the Swiss banking system, had a huge reverberating effect throughout that system, which is, I think, a positive effect. I think with regard to Africa, what I have to say, that especially in grand corruption--the corruption that sees the misappropriation of hundreds of millions of dollars, especially from countries that have serious extractive industries like oil and gold, et cetera--the serious grand corruption in those countries can not take place without the facilitation of key players in the West in the service sector—bankers, lawyers, accountants, et cetera--in the West, who are very integral to architecture of the corporate entities that are created to facilitate this looting. __EOS__ You're just 40 years old. You have any number of paths ahead of you that you could take in life, but reporters are starting to ask if you have designs on the Kenyan presidency yourself. Do you? __EOS__ No, no. Farai, I am currently a senior associate member at Oxford University. I'm very comfortable. It's a quiet existence, much more quiet than I had before. And you know, I've seen politicians close up, and what I saw wasn't very edifying. I will spend a bit more time thinking about them and writing about them, before thinking of taking the plunge into such a murky pool. ",3
50819," Would you explain the - describe the experience of shooting that?__EOS__ It was really odd. The captain, who was in the front passenger seat, said to me, you know, we're getting into kind of a tricky area. If we're going to get attacked, and I think we will, it'll probably be RPGs, and it'll be in the next, you know, half mile or so. And so, you know, I just - you know, I had the camera rolling, right, because I was shooting a lot of stuff. I was in the back seat.__EOS__ No kidding, wow.__EOS__ Yeah, it was a pressure-cooker bomb, that's right. And in Boston, you know, I was right down the street on Commonwealth Ave. at B.U., waiting to premiere my film about Tim at the JFK Library. You know, here's this horrible situation in Boston, several people killed, multiple amputations, many, many injuries from an explosion. It's exactly the kind of attack that Tim died in, except with Tim it was in a warzone, and it was an 81-millimeter mortar.",1
50820," Well, I was - you see, published so many of these articles for us and he - and it was of something of a plot, what would he do? What work of art and what exhibition and what painter would he like to write on. And we would talk about that, and then he would pick something, often in New York. And that meant coming down to New York for the day, arriving in the morning, and intensely looking at the picture. And sometimes, I would go to the gallery to see the event showing myself. And I would walk around it with him. And he was very, very silent and intense about it, and often rather funny in a quick little comment. And then he would go back in the afternoon, and look at it once more. And then he would go back to Massachusetts that very day. But within three or four days at most, we would have an extremely elegantly written and finely observed and very knowledgeable essay about that exhibition or that work of art. So that was - to see him work in that way, which I must tell you, in contest there are great many other writers but it was a - one had a sense of a marvelously controlled performance. __EOS__ Very disciplined he must have been, to be so prolific - more than 50 novels, and everything else that he wrote. What do you think... __EOS__ Thousand, thousands of pages of literary criticism in the New Yorker. Over 70 or 75 articles on art for us, dozens of novels -there's no other writer of our time who has been, at the same time, so prolific and so fine. __EOS__ Robert Silvers is editor and co-founder of the New York Review of Books. And we've been talking about the author John Updike. He died today at the age of 76. Mr. Silvers, thank you very much. ",0
50821," Yeah.__EOS__ Guy's psyched. I walk back to my office, pat myself on the back for being a charismatic leader. And so these if-then rewards are really easy. And so I think for those reasons, we get seduced and, again, use them for everything rather than where they work.__EOS__ Can I still get the $10,000?__EOS__ No.",3
50822," And right now, are you in any risk of being indicted?__EOS__ No. I believe that risk is long over. The statute of limitations and the case went inactive in 2003.__EOS__ You're still painting today.__EOS__ Oh, yes.",0
50823," But in the meantime, what Antigua is asking for is to be able to break copyright protection on things like Microsoft, for example. __EOS__ Well, it wouldn't be, you know, it wouldn't be breaking property right protection because we would have the authority of the WTO to do it. __EOS__ So you'd be legal but effectively, Microsoft would be in trouble, or other agencies, other people who distribute, what, software programs, movies of videos? __EOS__ Yes, all kinds of things and effectively, we're looking to waive those kinds of intellectual property rights for goods and services that we can sell from Antigua. ",3
50824," Yeah, it could be. It was not our intention to do this in the midst of an economic crisis. But, you know, we'll see how well it flies. We're also... __EOS__ Well, maybe you can try to sell it on the grounds of  in these hard times, why go buy five new electric guitars when you can buy one that does all... __EOS__ Oh, I like that. Can we use that? __EOS__ Yeah. ",2
50825," Here's an email from Peggy in Valentine, Nebraska  My mother scolded me regularly for practicing my Tarzan yell inside the house. She refused the argument when I told her I'd never get as famous as Carol Burnett without a decent Tarzan yell. __EOS__ Oh, that's adorable. __EOS__ And this from Kevin  Can Carol still do the Tarzan yell? __EOS__ Oh? You want it, huh? ",0
50826," Mm-hm. __EOS__ And one of the things that I've seen is that when I interview young people, they're like, yeah, whatever, you know, it's like that's who they love, that's what the deal is. __EOS__ Brian, that jibes with your numbers, doesn't it? And you also found that women are more open as well. __EOS__ Absolutely. The age difference is really dramatic. If you talk to someone over the age of 65, the definitions that they give are much more limited. One word that was used often when people are talking about co-habiting couples, whether straight or gay, was the idea that they were shacking up together. And I kept on hearing that phrase over and over. ",3
50827," Well, when I started taking it around, people were, you know, I think they were not expecting music that had so much rock and roll in it. They were expecting hip-hop. __EOS__ Was that because of racial pigeonholing? __EOS__ Yeah, of course. I mean, you know, everybody likes to put things in a box. And in 1988, '89, when I was putting it together, if you were black, that's what you were supposed to be doing, you know? Yeah. __EOS__ Is that part of the reason you spent a lot of your time in Paris? You relocated to Paris. There seems to be a long history of American artists who Americans try to pigeonhole, moving to Europe and finding that they're not pigeonholed easily when they go over there. ",2
50828," What's the lesson in that for you? I mean to watch them become the icon that they are?__EOS__ I think it's a style of acting that you trust. You trust the instincts. Meryl Streep's brilliant, just brilliant. I've been fortunate to do two movies with Meryl. And for an actor to go moment to moment like she does, there's no one better. And she dances between moments. Each take is different because she's riding instincts, she's riding impulses. And she trusts that.__EOS__ So a question about ""Dumb and Dumber.""

50831," You spent months institutionalized in a TB hospital. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And for someone at that age, you suddenly see the possibility of your own death. __EOS__ Yes. Yes, I was in the hospital for 20 months. We were in a general ward and I'd observed in the ward that almost all of the patients who coughed up blood ended up going to the - you call it a morgue, where we call it a mortuary. And one day, this thing happened to me. I coughed, and the blood just came gushing out of my mouth. And I sat and I still can't believe that that happened. But I sat there and I said to God, well, if it means I'm going to die, that's OK. I don't think I've ever felt that same kind of peace, the kind of serenity that I felt after acknowledging that maybe I was going to die of this TB. ",0
50832," Finally we are going to visit today with someone whose voice many people will know instantly because he is one of the pioneering voices on public radio. At one point he simultaneously hosted daily talk shows on both public radio and public television. He was the first person to do that. He is the author of 14 books, including several New York Times bestsellers and his high profile activism, particularly on issue of concern to African-Americans, caused Time magazine to name him to their list of the World's 100 Most Influential People in 2009. __EOS__ Michel Martin, always an honor to be on with you. __EOS__ Now, you know, I have to tell you, I've known you for years and I had no idea some of these things were part of your life. And as I understand it, even your parents did not know some of these things. Like the fact that you did not actually get your degree when you marched at graduation with your class. You didn't get your degree for another 16 years. And the fact that you were arrested for passing bad checks while in college. This is painful stuff. __EOS__ I couldn't have written this book 10 or 15 years ago. But 2011 is my 20th anniversary in the broadcast business and as I look back on what this two-decade journey has been, it is essentially a series of failing up. And moreover, all of the persons over these 20 years, Michel, I've gotten a chance to know and respect and revere, if they're being honest, and they had been with me in many conversations, they will tell you that they have failed their way up too.

Christianity has been very resilient and it's been very resilient I mean, obviously as a Christian I think it's been very resilient because it's true. But also think it's been resilient because there have been figures - whether it's a, you know, a Francis of Assisi in the Middle Ages or both sort of Protestants and Catholics during the Reformation and Counter-Reformation and so on, who were willing to sort of sit in the rubble of an institutional failure and start working again. And where those people come from I'm not sure, but they have appeared in the Christian past and it's reasonable for Christians to hope they might appear in the future as well.__EOS__ Ross Douthat's new book is called ""Bad Religion  How We Became a Nation of Heretics.""

So, you know, if people--they've seen me as Andre      3000, you know--this wild and crazy type of character.  I guess it's hard      for some casting directors or, you know, filmmakers to see that I may      have something, you know, else to offer.  That's why I felt like the      ""Four Brothers"" role was, you know, key to the beginning of my career,      just to show, you know, that I could do a little bit more. __EOS__  I understand--I read somewhere that when you read the script you      immediately fell in love with it.  Is that true? __EOS__  Yeah.  I thought the story was great.  I thought the story      of the four brothers, you know, being that two of them were black, two of      them were white--I thought it was kind of strange at first and I thought      it was kind of kooky, and that kind of attracted me in a certain sense. __EOS__  Andre, if you would, give me the plot for ""Four Brothers.""

I mean that was I wouldnt say a hobby but it was one of the things I would try to do. Of course, you know, you didn't have the lenses to get the shot quite right and you didn't have slow motion so, you know, when you watched the movie it was always over in like four milliseconds. Like you're like what? __EOS__ You know, you spent hours doing this whole thing and you get back and youre like... __EOS__ And youre watching it. And its like its always over instantly. And you just that think that was the biggest waste of an afternoon. So these kids, you know, directing these kids in that experience, all I cared about was obviously that they were safe.

Now, when you experience fear, your sympathetic nervous system kicks in so you have a rush of adrenaline, your heart rate increases, your breathing gets faster. Next, your nonessential systems start shut down, like digestion.__EOS__ So your mouth gets dry and blood is routed away from your extremities, so your fingers don't work anymore.

And the other quick question I wanted to ask Mr.      Miller is   I've noticed that, like--and I have yet to see ""Batman      Begins,"" but in reading The Dark Knight Returns and some of these other      comics that you've written, I'm finding a fascination--and I think that      the comic books like that that show actual reality with heroism in the      comics will be more truly presented in movies, rather than the campy, you      know, earlier ""Batman"" pictures and such.  I'd also like to see that in      other movies like, you know, ""Superman"" and that type thing, and I don't      know if there's kind of a push to maybe make that happen. __EOS__  What I think has happened, really, is that a generation of      people who read comic books have come up and taken over certain aspects      of entertainment.  In other words, the inmates have taken over the asylum      and you're all in trouble. ",0
50843," I know everyone wants to know what lixiviation means.__EOS__ Well, that was a term that we came up with. It was a film project that I did with the sculptor Ronald Mallory. He worked in mercury. And so the film was really a visualization of the movements of mercury and had to do with light, really, the abstraction of light. And so we actually coined this word, although maybe it does exist, and it has to do with light.__EOS__ Suzanne, I want to take you back, if you'll bear with me, a few decades, and ask you about being the young Suzanne who's the pioneer, who's the young woman who graduates from Berkeley and goes out and starts to score films and make commercials.__EOS__ I was in the right place at the right time because I had arrived already on the West Coast with this notion of computer music, having run into it for a moment at MIT. So when I arrived in Berkeley, and of course it wasn't - it was a very amazing time because it was - you know, there was tear gas coming through the window and riots and nothing was normal.",2
50844,"  Like father, like son. __EOS__  I'm afraid so.  It's a little scary.  It is.  It's a      little scary because--I mean, I believe one thing I learned from being my      father's son, and I think our generation learned from being the sons of      those hard fathers, is that it's not good for you or your children to be      a closed book, that people need to talk and to tell each other the truth      about each other so that they can have a relationship.  And so I      definitely try to be open and to tell the truth in an unrestrained way      without worrying about whether it's going to embarrass me or whatever.      And then I embarrass myself.  So you can't win. __EOS__  John Richardson is author of ""My Father the Spy   An      Investigative Memoir."" __EOS__  Thank you. ",0
50845," Yeah. But… __EOS__ Do you think the album will be releases in Brazil? __EOS__ Oh, yeah. For sure. Definitely. We just going to have to find, you know, the right way to do it. You know, we don't want to go to any major or anything like this. You know, we want to do with something that has more to do with our underground past and the way that we are. We're more like Grateful Dead, you know, or like - we like to put it out for free or something like this. __EOS__ Well, congratulations on Brazil winning the Olympics. ",2
50846," The Alaska plan ran into both local opposition - Alaskan Chambers of Commerce objecting to bringing in immigrants and Jews. Also, the appointed governor for Alaska, a man by the name of Earnest Gruening, was opposed to it. He happened to be an opponent of secretary of the interior, Ickes. They did not get along well. __EOS__ Wasn't - I have to ask. Wasn't Earnest Gruening Jewish? __EOS__ He was of Jewish descent. So the fact that Ickes wanted something along these lines and that his department signed off an a report called the Slattery Report, advocating this plan didn't cut any ice with Gruening. __EOS__ Professor, I'm just guessing that over the years that you've studied this, you've let your mind play over how the world might be different today if this plan had come about.

50847,"  Who is that, Monkey? __EOS__  Is somebody there? __EOS__  Are you drunk? __EOS__  I have needs. ",1
50848," What was the song? Why did you want it so badly? And how is it used in the movie? And then we'll hear it.__EOS__ The first Rolling Stones song that I cleared for Wes - in ""Rushmore,"" the Rolling Stones' ""I Am Waiting"" plays and it's a point where Max Fischer is in transition and is sort of at his lowest moment. It's just so...__EOS__ Max Fischer is the high school kid.__EOS__ Right.",2
50849," Oh, yeah. I went to a - a middle school in Queens and the students were doing little graphic novels, little tiny, little graphic short stories really about the diary. And every time I've talked to students or brought the diary to students and heard what they had to say, I've been incredibly moved by how current it is for them and how much it still affects them all these years later. __EOS__ Well, part of that is - is the theme of estrangement from your parents. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, you know, I remember when I was trying to figure out how old I was when I first read the diary. And I realized that I had seen the play when it opened on Broadway, which was in 1955. So I had - and I had read the book beforehand. So I read it sometime between '52 and '55, which meant I was about eight years old. But already I was kind of a precocious teen and the things that Anne was writing about, I mean this was before there were many young adult novels and that sort of writing. __EOS__ I want to get you to talk about perhaps the best known passage in the diary. And I will explain to our listeners that we're going to replay something from a story we did on the anniversary of Anne Frank's death back in 1995. And we have a - a succession of voices of teenage girls. Then Francine, I want to get you to talk about some of the varied reaction it sets off. ",0
50850," And just give us a sense of scale, just how many children are affected by this. Because rheumatic heart disease, this was a disease that in America, you know, we were dealing with 100 years ago.__EOS__ Yeah, a hundred years ago it was the number one killer of children in the United States. Now it's virtually zero. It's estimated in Africa that there's 18 million people that are suffering from this disease.__EOS__ There're so many characters in this film that I wanted to kind of follow off, you know, out of the frame and find out what happens to them, especially the children. There's about eight of them. Describe what these children are facing with this heart illness.__EOS__ Well, it's different for different cases. The disease sometimes attacks very aggressively and very quickly. But in other cases, it takes many, many years before they come to sort of an end of term. What I have found, these particular children - if they did not get surgery right away, they would die. And one of the most difficult things for me was meeting some of these kids that Dr. Emmanuel said, well, they can't go to Sudan because it's too late for them.",1
50851, So...__EOS__ .__EOS__ .__EOS__ Recognize that?,1
50852," Oh, so much. He  just standing next to him, singing ""Jumping At the Woodside"" my first week with him, my job was just to go... __EOS__ What does that mean? __EOS__ Well, when John sings his... __EOS__ There's all these like bends, as you were saying with Billie Holiday, you know. It's not... ",2
50853," Not in Dutch or Chinese or any other language? __EOS__ No. We didn't get that far. We would have loved that but it was just German and Italian. __EOS__ Otis, when you went into the studio to record these songs, did you have to do it again and again? Like, describe the process. __EOS__ Well, actually, it didn't take us long to really learn it. You know, we rehearsed it before we went into the studio just to get the gist of it and what have you. But once we got in there, we did not spend too much time in the studio. You know, we knocked it out rather quickly. So, no, we didn't spend, like, at the beginning of Motown when we would record our own songs in English. Sometimes we'd be up to 40 and 50 takes. But, no, it never got to that amount of takes. ",2
50854," Yeah. Interesting, as you say, that self-interested media moguls may be as much a part of the problem here as a repressive regime.__EOS__ Absolutely. Because, you know, self-censorship can be very bad. I mean, people want to get in the government's favor, they want to get contracts. A lot of these big media people own other things, other than newspapers, and the papers really become a kind of mouthpiece of the government, so they can flatter the Erdogan regime and thereby get the other deals that they want. So, this has become a huge tipping point for the press in Turkey. And I'd like to feel that - I think all of us would like to feel that this is a sign of the future, that actually the press will start to protect democracy instead of become a tool of totalitarianism.__EOS__ Let's talk about another regime that's certainly been acting under pressure for months and months now  the conflict in Syria. You were struck by an article by Robert Worth in the New York Times Magazine. The headline  The Price of Loyalty in Syria.__EOS__ Yeah. This is a wonderful piece of writing by Robert Worth, who's such a gifted writer, I must say. Because he's gone into Syria and talked about something that very few people have talked about, which is the other side, the Alawite side.",3
50855," Well, I was really lucky. I think I really fed a lot off of Mark Andrews, the director, who is the loudest, most exuberant man I've ever met. And he would set the scene for me. And then it would be a couple of minutes of silence, I think, in front of the mic while I just sort of assimilated all the information in my head.__EOS__ Kelly Macdonald, I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but one of the themes of ""Brave"" is Merida versus her mother the Queen and the tension between them.__EOS__ Yeah. Because, really, the thing about this story is it could actually have been set anywhere at any time. You know, it's about that mother-daughter dynamic and the trouble teenage girls can find themselves in when they start battling their mother. So I loved all that. I'm sort of nervous for my mother to see the film, to be honest, because I spend the whole film going, Mom! I think she's going to be a nervous wreck.__EOS__  And there is my mother. She's in charge of every single day of my life.",1
50856," So do they consult with you, the writers who are working on ""Everybody Loves Kostya,"" do they contact you? __EOS__ No. __EOS__ No. That's it. It's - you're done. __EOS__ I like to think I had a great influence on them and that they saw things my way. What I think happened was they said  Oh, you're very smart, thank you for coming, goodbye, and then did whatever the hell they wanted. ",1
50857," Really?__EOS__ Yeah. Yeah. Otherwise I might go crazy.__EOS__ And the character in the song, in ""Salford Sunday,"" how do you picture him?__EOS__ You know, that's really me. I mean, he is very close to me and the story is quite close to real events.",2
50858," Now, Democratic Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa wants to change the filibuster rules. How does he want to change them? __EOS__ What he wants to do is enact a new rule that the threshold for cloture decreases by three votes every time you vote on a particular proposal. __EOS__ So the logic of this is that eventually, over time, if there's 51 votes, if there's just, like, a majority of votes, then you can actually vote on the bill. __EOS__ That is the intent of the rule. I mean, my personal opinion is it's a really misguided proposal because it doesn't take seriously how senators will behave if the rule is adopted. ",0
50859," Yeah, its a pretty powerful song. It was written by Steven Dale Jones and Philip White, and I could definitely relate to it. As a father and as a parent to a child, you have to be, you have to wear so many hats, and you have to be so many different things. And they depend on you for so many different things. And so I feel like that song really kind of expressed that message and that concept in a great way. __EOS__ Do you ever ask yourself what you hope your sons might eventually take away from watching you on stage, night after night? __EOS__ Thats a great question. And this is actually the first time I've thought about this. You just brought it to my mind. But I got to thinking about Granny and her just trying to nurture me and be a good influence, and be a good example to me, and just take care of me and just love on me. And thats kind of what Im doing for my sons. But I may not ever know, you know, what kind of effect I might have on my sons, you know, in the same way that Granny probably never knew what kind effect she was having on me. __EOS__ Mr. Turner, thanks for wonderful Valentines Day visit - almost Valentine's Day visit. Thanks so much. ",2

You know, you go talk to him and he will make you feel whatever he wants you to feel, just by what he says or how he says it or how he looks at you - I can't figure that out, but he just does it.__EOS__ Hmm.__EOS__ And, yeah. I mean there was also Peter, when I, he tried to keep me in a certain amount of isolation so that I would get into that state of mind. I would, you know, we did a lot of yoga and meditation, which also helps. And, yeah, he made me listen to a lot of spiritual or a certain kind of music. It's like very deep and very, it really affects you mentally. And you just use all of that and you kind of just do it.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News.

The lead character of Pi stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger and a complicated story.",1
50862," Sure. __EOS__ When I was about 14 living in Chicago, growing up in Chicago, me and my twin brother, my mom and her boyfriend used to take us to Chinatown about once every two months. And we would go specifically to learn the different foods and enjoy the food, but we got to learn to eat with chopsticks very perfectly. And when the great Chairman Nixon okayed us to have relations with China in about 19 - was it - 87, I had the pleasure of going down to Chinatown on a very snowy - the very first day it was okay to talk to China and hear Studs Terkel and some Chinese dignitaries toast our new relation with China and America. __EOS__ That's great.

50866," ""Safe Haven"" is a thriller as well as a romance. And at the heart of that premise is a man who's abused his wife. You have often, I think, notably used real-life events for people as inspirations in your novels. Tell us about this and if there was any of that in ""Safe Haven.""__EOS__ Not so much in ""Safe Haven."" ""Safe Haven"" was among the most fictional novels I've written. But certainly a lot of my early work were inspired by events in my own family. ""The Notebook"" was inspired by the story of my wife's grandparents, for instance. ""Message in a Bottle"" was really inspired by my father after the death of my mom and the struggles that he had to move on and find happiness again. ""A Walk to Remember"" was inspired by my sister's battle with cancer. So, as I've moved forward, sometimes that comes back and sometimes it doesn't. But ""Safe Haven"" was largely a fictional novel.__EOS__ Did it entail you to do research in things like abusive relationships or talk to people to try and understand the emotional terrain there?__EOS__ Yeah, of course. I mean, there was a lot of research. And at the same time, it's something that most people, they're familiar with the theme. And the question then becomes how do you make the story feel fresh. And, for me, what I tried to concentrate on primarily was the aftermath of such an event, the healing process, so to speak, after someone goes through a very traumatic event, what is their life like? So, when I was working to create Katie, the character in the novel, there was a mystery to her past. She was very guarded. She was closed off. And it took the intervention of a small community, so to speak - friends and she meets the storeowner, Alex. And little by little, it's as if she gradually begins to accept the fact that she can move on from this point. So, the novel is really about - and the film, of course - it's really about second chances. It's about healing. It's about moving forward, so to speak.",1
50867," The problem is big and growing. Right now, two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese, and one-third of American children. And the numbers in children are particularly alarming because they seem to be growing, and those children tend to track into their adult life with weight problems in those years, as well.__EOS__ So when did the obesity problem really blossom in America, and what's changed? What's been driving it?__EOS__ Rates of obesity began to increase significantly in the 1970s but really went through the roof in the '80s and the '90s. In fact, at first glance it's simple to explain. People are eating more, and they're exercising less. But beyond that, it gets to be pretty complicated because there are a lot of ways people are doing those two things.__EOS__ What are some of the health consequences of all this extra weight people are carrying?",3
50868," ""Nigunim."" And it features a string quartet on. Tell us about this song.__EOS__ Well, first of all, ""Nigunim,"" it was arranged by Omer Avital. It has a string quartet in it, and it's a very traditional song. It has a little bit of the Klezmer, the crying clarinet sound that I definitely connect with. And when I was doing this album, I was looking for sounds that the clarinet, you know, music, melodies that I feel comfortable expressing, that I grew up with, that are just a part of me that I don't have to try and understand, that I can just be and live inside them. And ""Nigunim"" is just one of those melodies. It's just, you know, you will hear it.__EOS__ Well, it's beautiful. So this is ""Nigunim"" from Anat Cohen's album ""Poetica,"" with Anat Cohen featured on clarinet and a string quartet with an arrangement by the bass player, Omer Avital.__EOS__ That's my guest clarinetist Anat Cohen from her album ""Poetica,"" a traditional Israeli song called ""Nigunim."" Anat Cohen is from Israel. She grew up and Tel Aviv, and has lived in the U.S. since 1996, when she first started attending the Berklee School of Music.",2

50871," If you get more and more of these individuals saying that, what are we saying about our future? __EOS__ Absolutely, and if I'd - like to add, I haven't got a chance to the read the story of the book yet, but you know, the institution of marriage, as far as towards guys, with the way that, you know, child support and alimony is paid out, that there's really no benefit right now as far as just the contract terms of marriage for men. __EOS__ Yeah, well, I hear from a lot of men who are upset about the way that the divorce culture has worked out for them. I mean, they have seen uncles or fathers or brothers or friends who have been kicked out of the house, lost contact with their children, and lost a lot of money because of having gotten married. __EOS__ Understandable.

I saw the movie about Margaret Thatcher. And Meryl Streep, for me, is one of the greatest actress in the world. But when you watch that movie, you think I'm watching Meryl Streep playing Margaret Thatcher. You don't get lost for one second because you know Margaret Thatcher. You can have - Anthony Hopkins who is one of the greatest actors ever playing Picasso. I will never, one frame, one second of the movie, thought I'm watching Picasso.__EOS__ You know, I had the same feeling watching the film. There are scenes in New York where, you know, at this club, it's like Thelonious Monk is at the piano, Charlie Parker's playing - the scene with, like, Ben Webster playing saxophone.",3
50873," I feel for you. I just think that must have been so hard to have the pull of your family and the desire for the life of a young person.__EOS__ Yeah, but you know, in retrospect, it's probably the single biggest thing that made me what I am today. There's no question that you're either going to fold in a situation like that, or you're going to develop reservoirs of strength you didn't even know you had.__EOS__ But you always have to ask yourself, am I being selfish, you know, to want my life?__EOS__ Yeah, but I fled.",3
50874," Well, Michel, the problem really is that it is an irrepressible personal loss. Susan and I traveled a very tough journey together for almost 31 years of marriage. We had gone through all trials and tribulations but we also had our moments of triumphs. It is unfortunate that at the dawn of trying to see a new Zimbabwe she passed away. In her own opinion, bless her soul, I am sure she would be the first one to say don't retreat. And I say so with the full conviction of her determination to see a new Zimbabwe. It is unfortunate but my family would not have accepted me to retreat, my party would not have, even the people of Zimbabwe. The outpouring of grief was a demonstration of how profound they were touched by these accidents and my loss because to them, my loss is their loss. And perhaps there was even a fear that I might give up. So what will replaced that? So I'm really touched by that and I think it makes our grief less. __EOS__ I did want to ask you, what is the source of your strength and stamina? I had the opportunity to speak with you on an earlier visit to the United States. And I was just still interested to know, how do you maintain your stamina and your optimism? __EOS__ Well, my motivation is really the people. You know, when people place faith in you, you actually have a burden of responsibility to ensure that you fulfill their expectation and hope. Because if you are the only hope available, it is very disappointing then to disappoint them on the question of what they are expecting their lives to be. So perhaps I represent that hope and because of that I also have to owe them, the people who support me and who have supported me through thick and thin. __EOS__ What is your most pressing request of the international community at this time? ",3
50875," And I remember seeing the Modern Jazz Quartet on there. And I also remember seeing Dizzy Gillespie on ""Sesame Street"" when I was really little. I remember seeing John Blake, the violinist, on ""Mr. Rogers"" when I was a kid.__EOS__ Well, and that made an impression on you? That made you think wow, this is interesting?__EOS__ I think, you know, it was, and especially because I remember seeing John Blake playing violin and I was playing violin and so I remember thinking wow, you can do that on violin too? And, of course, the whole soundtrack to a lot of those shows like you know, Toots Thielemans played the theme to ""Sesame Street"" and, you know, Roger Callaway was the pianist on ""Mr. Rogers."" So like there were gigs for pretty serious jazz artists on TV.__EOS__ But then also, I have to say that when I was in junior high and high school, that was around the time of Herbie Hancock's ""Rockit."" Okay.",3
50876," So you stood there and you basically said I'm not going to worry about what Strom Thurmond says in a speech somewhere. I'm going to relate to him as a person, and he related to you as a person. __EOS__ That's right. Fulbright voted against the civil rights bill. __EOS__ Senator Fulbright. Yeah. __EOS__ And never - nobody never asked me about Fulbright. I mean, you know, I liked Fulbright just like I liked Thurmond. We were friends. ",0
50877," I've read that you admit to, in normal, every day life not having a very good memory. How is that possible?__EOS__ Yeah. So, I never had a good memory. It was something that was always an annoyance to me. I always had trouble remembering things and things would fly into my head and then out right the other side. And my grandmother actually suffered from Alzheimer's disease and she passed away in 2009 from it and that was the turning point.__EOS__ Are there any everyday tasks that go more easily that you're better at for having mastered this kind of memory?__EOS__ Yeah, definitely. So names and faces. I'm very good at remembering just lists of things that I have to do. It's very useful. And when I got out into, say, a meeting or an interview or a social setting, I know that you can give me information and I can spew it back to you, if need be. And that's a really comforting feeling and allows me to be a little more confident.",3
50878," I mean, apparently so... __EOS__ ...because it keeps popping up in my movies. So there's something about it. I don't know what that is - something about the other. I don't know what it is, but I'm very - I always am interested in how ordinary people's lives are affected when change - and that change can be as subtle as someone coming into their lives or meeting someone -one person, one choice, one decision, one interaction - and the impact that can have and how it can push us off to a completely different direction. And maybe because as a young person, I felt like that happened to me a lot. __EOS__ Have you ever thought about acting or - and I was like no. It seemed like crazy, but she was right, you know? She got me to try out for something, and I never would have -probably never would have done it on my own. We don't keep in touch. I probably haven't seen her in 25 years and... __EOS__ But if she's listening right now, she's responsible for your career. ",1
50879," You mean as a man? __EOS__ Well, married with kids. And one of the reasons we're particularly interested in talking with you is that African-American marriages seem to be under particular stress. The rates of divorce are higher. What's interesting is that it used to be that more African-Americans statistically were married than whites as a percentage of the population. That has changed dramatically since the 1960s. __EOS__ Sure. __EOS__ And the percentage of black children living in homes without two parents is higher than for any other part of the population. So one of the reasons we're interested in talking to you is what  just to get your take on this as a person who's not only in the trenches, but is also writing about it. ",3
50880," So you could have copyrighted your version.__EOS__ Well, no I couldn't. But I've gotten his words wrong before, and he got mad at me. One time we did a song, a country song called ""You Ain't Going Nowhere,"" and I reversed the order, I said pack up your money and pick up your tent. And about six months later he recorded it, and it came out pick up your money and pack up your tent, McGuinn.__EOS__ That's from a wonderful record, ""Sweetheart of the Rodeo.""__EOS__ ""The Sweetheart of the Rodeo,"" and Gram Parsons was a catalyst for that. Chris Hillman had grown up in bluegrass music and loved country, and he invited Gram to come over, who basically replaced David Crosby when he left. So I wanted somebody to play McCoy Tyner-style piano, and I tested Gram. I said  Can you play any jazz piano?",2
50881," That's right, the so-called PayPal Mafia.__EOS__ Describe it.__EOS__ PayPal was a really intense company founded by Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, and later added on by Elon Musk with the acquisition of X.com. What it was is all a bunch of young folks who built what's now become a global payments, you know, OS, a global payments service - operating system for OS, sorry, Silicon Valley speak. And what happened is the whole company kind of grew into this global phenomenon in a three-year basis, and was purchased by eBay.__EOS__ And so, have you ended up having alliances with these people of the sort you've been describing?",0
50882," Hmm. The idea of excavating, that's a very curious way to think about what goes on between a husband and a wife.__EOS__ I think that probably the work of a writer in many ways could be described as excavating. I'm interested in moments, very fragile and quite difficult moments, I suppose, in my characters' lives. I'm interested in the struggles that they have because I feel like in those struggles, in their sort of weakest moments when they are sort of faced with who they really are and the kind of depths of themselves, that is the moment not only for revelation but for, I suppose, transformation, for some kind of transcendence of the conditions that they've always felt locked in. And so, I suppose, that sense of digging down through the self, into others, into our own selves is somehow, to me, work I'm familiar and quite comfortable with, really.__EOS__ That idea of loneliness that she describes and that shot throughout the book, that theme of loneliness. I mean, all of your characters at a certain level are profoundly sad. Do you worry about writing a book like that?__EOS__ No. I mean, I don't - I think the characters in this book are struggling, but I think to me that's the place where I feel and where I think my characters feel most alive, frankly. And I think somehow the solitude of my characters is not something that any of them happily accept. All of them are dissatisfied with that alienation or that isolation that they feel. They all quite desperately would like to be known, would like to be seen and understood, would like to communicate themselves. I feel the sort of liveness and the exhilaration of the effort, the effort to be known and to sort of to go beyond solitude.",0
50883,"  Potholder?__EOS__  Ready for that?__EOS__ The script for ""Bad Words"" was once on The Black List. That's a survey of Hollywood movie executives who list the best scripts they've read that haven't been made. We asked Bateman why no one had taken a chance on this one.__EOS__ The scripts that are on that list are great scripts, but there's something about them that keeps them from getting produced. And in this case, I think it was because it seemed very challenging to the reader to have anybody sort of like this guy, this central character that I ended up playing. He is a guy who's had his feelings hurt. He elects to try to fix his problem by crashing a kids' spelling bee. That has some relevance in his revenge scenario.",1
50884," Right. You're either a Chinese cook or a gangster or a Kung Fu master who could kick butt, but can't speak English...__EOS__ But can't speak English.__EOS__ ...or a geek who can't get a date. And so, over time, I think I just internalized a lot of these images and I became that quintessential Asian nerd.__EOS__ Well, you know, you obviously did very well. I mean, you graduated from Stanford and then Yale Law School and, you know, started doing kind of the traditional route, so I think, for a lot of people, it will be very surprising that you then decided to go on a reality program. And, as I understand it, though, your earlier history actually played some role in your wanting to do that.",3
50885," Well, most people have their coverage through their jobs and most insurers, about 87 percent of insurers according to the Guttmacher Institute do cover abortion. And the Kaiser Family Foundation did a survey of employers back in 2003 and found that about 46 percent of workers have abortion coverage. So for most of them who have job-based coverage, they probably cover abortion. __EOS__ Do we have any sense of how many people this would affect? How many people  how many women would likely be covered by either the public option plan or would be using a government subsidy to purchase coverage, and so therefore would be affected by this restriction if it goes into effect? __EOS__ It could be quite a few because the exchanges are going to be open to the uninsured and theres 46, 47 million folks who are uninsured. It will be open to people who buy their own insurance right now, theres about 18 million of those. And it would be open to certain small businesses initially. And over time, theyre talking about expanding it to larger businesses. So were talking about a lot of folks would be in these exchanges. __EOS__ Can you  and I dont know if you feel comfortable answering this - but Ill ask this in case. Those who support this amendment say this is merely a logical extension of existing federal policy which bans the use of federal funds to pay for abortions and they say all this does is extend this language this existing policy to a new context. And, of course, the opponents of this measure say that this is not true, that this extends this ban to whole other range of circumstances. Can you weigh in on that? ",3
50886," Absolutely, it's the new 30. And it's coming up to be the new 20, actually, really soon.__EOS__ .__EOS__ So watch that space. But, you know, I was born in 1954. I've lived through all these decades and seen all the changes being witnessed to the collective thing that's gone on in the planet, and there's a part of me kind of sometimes wants to slow it down and go back. And the one thing you cannot do - and this is inherent, this sort of irony of the title - you cannot go back. There's no turning back of the clock. You'll never do that. So ""Nostalgia"" is a dip into an imaginary space, really.__EOS__ Annie Lennox, thanks very much.",2

It's one of the few that I like better now than at the time that I did it - a picture called ""The Hill"" with Sean Connery. __EOS__ Right. ",1

Needless to say, Phoenix had a very good 2009, but the band earned a dubious reputation even before that album. They're really slow to record new music.

How old were you when you first started singing and when you first started writing like this?__EOS__ When I first started singing, I was very young. My parents took us to church every Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday evening, and that was for 18 years of my life. And the congregations that we went to were maybe about 400 people every Sunday, and everybody were just lifting their voice. And so I found that if I sat beside different people, then I just started to mimic what they would do with their voices. And it was just a silly, playful way to learn how to use my voice as an instrument.",2
50891," But getting back to them hiring you, you know, before the book existed. They were okay with it? Like, you told them your story, and they had faith that you would remain sober and do a good job. __EOS__ Yeah. It's not something that we committed to directly. I mean, I didn't, in fact, remain sober. So - and I don't think that that's part of the contract. I did try drinking again. It didn't go very well. My work never suffered, per se. My work rarely did. It's always the last thing to go. But if you took all of the functioning alcoholics and addicts out of the American economy, you'd be taking out a lot of firepower and a lot of talent. __EOS__ So this question is probably way too personal, so just... __EOS__ I bet not.

50892," Well, he overdosed on - probably on prescription drugs. Lay down. I -we'll never know whether it was an accident or a suicide. __EOS__ Was he lost to you already? __EOS__ No. He was quite present to me and he had just - my younger brother was - had cerebral palsy and had other physical problems, and by the - he was in his early 50s, I guess, late 40s, early - how old was he anyway? He could not walk anymore, though he'd just been in a therapeutic situation in which he was trying to get back some ability to walk. He was a street person. He was kind of a scoundrel in the way that you are. __EOS__ When you say a street person, do you mean he lived on the street? ",0

Kitt died in 2008. She continued to perform well into her 70s. That's when an inspiring jazz singer named Rene Marie got to see her on stage for the first time.__EOS__ My mouth was hanging open like everybody else's. I was drooling.

50894," Hawking himself is strongly atheist. He's a rationalist, quite an unsentimental person in his public appearances, but in this film, you seem to be reaching for a way to demonstrate that he is an inspiring person. Did you talk about that - the difference between the man and the way you made the movie?__EOS__ No, I mean, I think that for me, in my mind, there's no question that Stephen is an inspirational figure. This man was given two years to live and rather than go into a sort of deep melancholy, which he did for a moment or two, he's chosen to - he says that everyday beyond those two years has been a great gift.__EOS__ Eddie Redmayne - he plays Stephen Hawking in the new film ""The Theory Of Everything.""

50895," Well, this is the rectum chapter and I wanted to provide a narrative that would be appropriate and interesting setting for the reader. And I thought well, what is the rectum? Well, it's a storage facility. The rectum enables us to hold on to waste and that means we don't need to stop what we're doing and find a bathroom. We can hold it. I mean we have a little closet, we have a little suitcase - if you will - and we can hold it there. And that, you know, it's a force for civilized behavior and again, thank you to the rectum well. OK, so I thought all right, well, who would be someone who'll would be interesting to talk to. And people who smuggle contraband. For people who smuggle contraband, the human body, the human alimentary system, is a handy pocket - if you will - particularly the rectum. In prisons, there's a, I was at Avenel State Prison where they have a problem with cell phone smuggling, people smuggling cell phones in and conducting drug deals and hits and things like that that they shouldn't be doing. And so I spent some time with a man who is - it's called hooping - as in through the hoop. And hooping is a way of life in prison. It's not - 'cause I thought well, this would be a little strange to sit down with the man and talk about the things that he puts in his rectum. But, in fact, he was just like yeah, well, what do you want to know? So it was an interesting afternoon.__EOS__ So what are some of the things that he's put there?__EOS__ The most common thing is bindles of tobacco, because you're not supposed to have tobacco. And so people put these plugs of tobacco wrapped in a condom or a piece of latex and that's often - he said if you're going into solitary confinement, you're going into the hole, the other hole, you want to bring in your smoking material. So they'll put up the tobacco and the lighter and so they'll smuggle it into solitary because you're not allowed to have it there.__EOS__ So was the person who you interviewed in prison there because he had smuggled things this way? Like how did you know to talk with him?",3

We started by talking about what kind of preparation she did to play someone suffering from debilitating pain.__EOS__ It was a lot of studying the back, the leg, the neck. Pretty much every single part of her body hurt. And you really do start to manifest odd little, you know, cricks and pinches in your neck. And every week, I would have some form of bodywork just to sort of make sure my body didn't kind of lock into any of that permanently.",1

And they're giving you these, like, one-word - reluctant one-word, you know, answers. I think they're in, like, their young teens at this point. And you're trying to get them to actually, like, talk to you, so here's a scene from ""Boyhood,"" featuring my guest, Ethan Hawke.__EOS__  Talk to me. Samantha, how was your week? Oh, I don't know, dad. It was kind of tough. Billy and Ellen broke up, and Ellen's kind of mad at me because she saw me talking to Billy in the cafeteria. And you remember that sculpture I was working on? It was a unicorn and the horn broke off, so now it's zebra, OK? But I still think I'm going to get an A, all right? Mason, how was your week? Well, dad, you know, it was kind of tough. Joe, he's kind of a jerk. Actually, he stole some cigarettes from his mom, and he wanted me to smoke them, but I said no because I knew what a hard time you had quitting smoking, dad. How about that?

50899,"  And that this gave you the grounding that you later needed when you were called upon to be well - when you're the president of the Urban League you've got to speak a lot. __EOS__  Yeah. The Easter speech programs, these programs on Easter Sunday afternoon, while they were not competitive, the appreciation as expressed in the applause was such that you knew who was more appreciated as the kids came up, and I always did well in that. And because of that, I was put into a declamation contest where you actually say - you speak from First Corinthians or the 23rd Psalm. You memorize it and you go up and you speak, and I was very successful at that. __EOS__  And this has undoubtedly benefited you your entire career. __EOS__  Yes. There's no question about it. ",0
50900," No, no, I didn't. Partly I'm always impatient in science fiction movies or books where there's this explanation, well, there was a temporary disturbance in the Earth's magnetic field or...__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ Or, you know, tons of industrial waste were dumped into the river, and that's why this monster was created. Yeah, I understand that there may be social criticism embedded in those sort of explanations, but they always seem kind of cheap and easy.

50903," Thank you, Farai. __EOS__ So take me back to that moment when you first learned that you had cancer. __EOS__ Well, like you said I was 16 years old, a sophomore in high school, preparing for my junior year. And basically while everyone else was thinking about turnabout dances and proms, I've discovered a lump while in the shower one morning getting ready for school. But Farai, I have no family history of breast cancer. No one in my community, my church or school obviously had breast cancer and so I really thought not much about it. After a few weeks, however, I went to the doctor for a routine physical and the doctor confirmed that lump. She said, do you feel that? And I said, yes. And she told me I'm sure it's nothing because girls are developing at a rapid pace at your age, but we need to get a biopsy just in case. And at 16 years old, those results came back, malignant and I had a rare and very aggressive form of cancer and the doctors just couldn't believe it. __EOS__ So before we talk a little bit about your treatment, who were you? You know, what kind of girl were you at 16 before the diagnosis? ",3
50904," That's good. So - but it didn't get traction, is what you're saying.__EOS__ No, it didn't get traction, and to be honest, you know, I thought it was actually really well-executed. So it's not like it failed because it wasn't well-done. I think it failed because people lacked the motivation to contribute.__EOS__ Well, one of the major obstacles to open science, you say, is scientists being rewarded for publishing scientific papers. How do you change that culture?__EOS__ Yeah, so, I mean, I should say first of all that it's a terrific thing that they get rewarded. If you go back to the 17th century, scientists generally weren't rewarded much at all for sharing discoveries, and as a result, they conducted a lot of their research very, very secretively indeed.",0

50908," My impression from your book is what he agreed with, with the Germans was that white Europeans were superior in every way to anyone else.__EOS__ Oh absolutely, you're absolutely right, which was not an unpopular view back then. But he certainly was a racist, in the sense that he thought people of Northern European descent, i.e., whites, were inherently superior in every possible way to people who were not white. And, you know, the Germans obviously shared that view.__EOS__ So why did he think that America should not intervene in World War II?__EOS__ He basically thought that the Germans were too strong and that the rest of Europe should make peace with Germany, should basically come to a negotiated peace with them, that the U.S. should stay out of any European entanglements. It went along somewhat with that racist white ideology belief that he had that America should, if it got into war, should side with European countries, the white countries. It should not enter into a war in which European countries were fighting each other. It should stay out. It should defend itself, it should arm enough so that we can defend ourselves against any invader, but we should definitely stay out of the war that was raging in Europe.",0

I know I can speak sort of for my brother's experiences. They live in the D.C. area and have two young kids. And his wife had chosen to stay at home and to leave her career and raise the kids at home.

50910," No criminal charges in this case. __EOS__ Not those individuals. No. We basically we could not prove that anyone had any criminal liability at that point, because they didn't know what they had. They didn't even know what the crystal ball was. __EOS__ So as you imagine how they might have gotten there, what do you figure? __EOS__ You know, my thought of it is that it might've been a frat prank, you know, by some of the kids at the University of Pennsylvania. Maybe they went in, grabbed these pieces knowing that they were very, very popular and very high profile, took them out and basically didn't want them and left them in the mud room when they couldn't carry them, and that was it, just didn't want to be caught.

And we were satisfied that he didn't, and we moved on. I think I was probably - maybe 10 or so, at the time. And I really didn't think much more about it until I was in college; and I read his book, his memoir, which is called ""My Life with Charles Manson.""

Tell me one of the things that first you remember about her. __EOS__ Oh gosh. There's no - I mean, there's just just so many words I can describe her. But ultimately, she's a beautiful spirit, very strong spiritual woman, someone who has always worked very, very hard throughout her life. And I think it's kind of difficult, and it has been challenging for her at this age now, she's kind of still resenting it, you know. And she's still mobile, she still weaves rugs, but one of the things that she's always emphasized and stressed to me was to maintain the language.  __EOS__ What was the first time that you realized that it made a difference to other people, if not to you, that you have both African-American and Native American heritage?

The song is called ""Struggle,"" and it's from Chopteeth's self-titled debut CD.  __EOS__ Hello. __EOS__ And Robert Fox is also here, bass player, founding member. And welcome to you. __EOS__ Thank you for having us, David. ",2

50923," Jackie, so sorry for your loss. __EOS__ Oh, thank you. __EOS__ Oh, well, I think that happens all too often - is people being strung out to more and more chemotherapy, which may extend their lives marginally, but it also is, you know, it's a terrible life being on chemo. So I would not wish that on anybody. __EOS__ Right, well, this was as recent as a year ago. So anyway, I wish she were around to hear this because I remember driving back with her from chemo and her, you know, just questioning herself and what she knew about her body and how the doctors and nurses were insisting that no, she was getting better when, in fact, she was right that she was getting worse. So anyway… ",0
50924," Within about two years, I think he became very depressed. He ended up changing his name. He legally changed his name twice and rejoined the British army, specifically as a private. By the time of the end of the war he was a lieutenant colonel. And, again, because he was now a national figure, if he had wanted to return to the military, he certainly could've gone as a full colonel, if not even higher.__EOS__ And did he ever return to the Middle East?__EOS__ He did come back to the Middle East a couple years later but he never went back to Syria. He never went back to Damascus and he'd used Damascus as a battle cry. It's like, you know, on to Damascus. He'd used that for two years with the Arab rebels. Two days after it fell, he got in a car and left and never came back.__EOS__ And did he maintain any contact with, you know, the tribes that he'd spent, you know, endured such hardship with?",0
50925," Right. I thought we'd listen to a scene here. I mean, this is at a point a little farther into the film, where some of your character's reluctance to deal with the robot has been overcome because the robot is, after all, a home health care aid and has, you know, gotten you on a regular diet and some healthier food and exercise. And so your character's mental acuity is beginning to come back, and he gets interested in resuming his old career, which as you say it's stealing.__EOS__ And he gives me enemas, and that'll always bring back your mental acuity.__EOS__ I trust that was not re-enacted on the set?__EOS__ No, it was not, mercifully.",1
50926," Hemingway created it very much and has made it something intoxicating and addictive in itself, I think. We still, in many ways, are in love with it. I grew up in an alcoholic family myself, and I really wanted to sort of pull that apart, see what was behind it, see what was going on with it.__EOS__ How many of these greats were writing while under the influence?__EOS__ Well, that's an interesting question, because they tended not to actually write drunk, which I think is something that when we think about writing drinking, we're assuming that they're getting drunk and getting to the typewriter and, you know, writing in these states of intoxication. And that tends not to happen.__EOS__ I bitterly regret doing that. You can tell when I did. So think it's more that it runs contemporaneously through their lives. So you see them, like Hemingway, say, working very hard in the mornings - Tennessee Williams did this too - with the black coffee but later on in the day as a sort of change of tune, change of channel, they start really hitting it hard and the next morning get up and do the whole thing over again.",0
50927," It's very painful in the book to read about these two glittering people having to contend with what they did in the last year of their lives. __EOS__ Yeah. He had emphysema and diabetes and sleep apnea, and a host of sort of other things. And mom, she just kind of gave up. She kept falling and breaking things. She was very tall and - and anyway she - and she just sort of gave up. And in the fashion of Victorian ladies, just, after she broke whatever bone it was, she just took to her bed and stayed there. You know, she took to her bed to die. And it was, you know, it is sad to see, well, anyone deteriorate like that. Old age ain't for sissies. And when - she died first, two years ago, on this day. And that was, you know, kind of a blessing, really. __EOS__ I have to ask about the last words to your mother. __EOS__ Well, I raced to her bedside; she was in a coma. She was past hearing. And I held her hand and I said, you know, I forgive you, which was, you know, mom had - mom could be very naughty and to, you know, hurtful. I said it to her on her deathbed, I think, more for my peace of mind than for hers, because she was a proud woman, she never would have, you know, she was not a woman who said I'm sorry for having, you know, caused a scene or whatever. She just - she just couldn't bring herself to do that. So, and she was not a religious woman so she wouldn't have asked a priest for absolution. So, anyway I just found myself saying that to her. And I hope, when I'm on my deathbed, people forgive me... ",0
50928," Your description of our retired life is accurate. We did have a good time and we enjoyed it. In 2007, it became apparent that Sara was having a problem, asking the same question over and over again, and so we started down the road with the doctors and the hospitals and all of the tests and the very frustrating thing was that all of the doctors had no answers for us.__EOS__ I can't - I don't want to skip past the emotional side of it. I know our focus is the financial side of it, but I can't skip past the emotional side of it. I mean, this is a person who has been at your side for 50 years and, you know, that can't be easy to see that person slipping away in front of you. I wanted to ask, what was the hardest decision that you had to make in all this so far?__EOS__ The very hardest decision, the most emotional decision was, once we had decided that Sara could not stay at home because she needed 24-hour care, to find a place where she could get that care. There's lots of places available and there are lots of conditions, lots of different prices and different services. But how do you know which one place is going to take care of your loved one in an appropriate way?__EOS__ Talk about, if you would - how much does this cost for somebody who requires that level of care?",3
50929," That's also a modified version of something that he said to Congress. And it was turned into a formal prayer by somebody, we don't know exactly who. __EOS__ And there's a whole range of stories. There's a story about his late-in-life total immersion baptism. There's a story about his comforting a Jewish soldier on Hanukkah at Valley Forge. There's no end to stories about what a prayerful man he was. __EOS__ Yeah. I think this is a reflection of something that many Americans feel this need to be close to Washington and feel this need to feel like he's one of us. __EOS__ What about the argument one can hear at the other end of the spectrum that while he may not have been an atheist, Washington was a deist, and that indeed, his views of God might be closer to today's secularists than today's evangelicals? ",0
50930," We're speaking with William McGee. His new book is called ""Attention All Passengers."" We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, we're speaking with William McGee. He spent many years working in the airline industry. He now writes about it and was the consumer representative to the Future of Aviation Advisory Committee for the federal government. He has a new book about cost-cutting in airlines and its effects. It's called ""Attention All Passengers  The Airlines' Dangerous Descent and How to Reclaim Our Skies.""__EOS__ Yes, this is an issue I've been following for several years now. I worked in the airline industry for seven years before I started writing about it, and quite frankly, I always felt that I had a pretty good handle on the industry. And it wasn't until about 2006, when Consumer Reports asked me to launch an investigation into this topic, that I realized just how much had changed so quickly.__EOS__ Of course the Federal Aviation Administration, the FAA, does have safety regulations for airlines, and there are maintenance rules they are supposed to follow. And I gather they've historically had FAA offices near the airlines, where they could kind of keep an eye on their shops and how they were maintaining planes. How has outsourcing affected the FAA's ability to keep track of what's going on?",0

50932," Right. That's good enough.__EOS__ Close enough.__EOS__ Give us a taste of the basic sound of the Theremin. Our listeners will recognize it from lots of science-fiction movies.__EOS__ OK, let me describe what I'm doing. I'm not touching the instrument when I'm playing it now. I'm moving my hands around it to control the volume and the pitch of the sound. I'll just make a very quick sound, and then maybe later I can actually try and play a melody.",2
50933," Had you read the original Darwin before you jumped into this project? __EOS__ In large bits and pieces. Its interesting. My background in undergrad - I was in ecology. And it was something that we used pretty constantly, but just as a basic principle. It was not something that we needed to go back and study his actual words, which was actually a shame. But, you know, every text that you would deal with  whether youre talking population genetics or, you know, evolution or embryology - is going to - or even ornithology or anything like that - is going to key off of the basic principles that he set forth. But you dont have to go back to 1859 to read it. __EOS__ Lets go to the phones - Matt in Minneapolis. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. __EOS__ Thank you very much. I was just interested in asking the author - first of all, I think its a brilliant idea to do an illustrated graphic novel of The Origin of Species and how Darwin created and wrote it. I was wondering what other graphic novels have inspired, if any, that inspired your work. Were you inspired by Art Spiegelmans Maus, which, you know, won the Pulitzer Prize or R. Crumbs recent illustrated Bible? He did all of Genesis, that just came out recently. There have been a lot of great, like, you know, graphic novels in the non-superhero style written over the last, like, 10 years. And I was wondering if you looked to any of those to help inspire how you told the story and the illustration. ",0
50934," And you actually visited a real psychiatric ward to do some research before playing a suicidal man in his 30s. __EOS__ I visited two before even hearing about the movie. No, I did. I was in New Mexico, and I went to a couple of facilities there and just kind of asked questions and listened. And in some cases, it's hard to tell from the people that are working there, that are - people that are patients, which I thought was interesting. There was this one woman, a young woman, I was convinced was a patient. She said, oh, you know - after talking to her, she's like, you want to step in my office and talk about some more things? It's like, oh, my gosh, she's an administrator. But lovely, lovely people. And it is a little bit of a serious - obviously - topic where people are struggling and have some chemical problems going on. And I've never been into a mental facility, so it was interesting to watch. __EOS__ You've done the - sort of the movie festival scene for this new film, ""It's Kind of a Funny Story."" Are people accepting you as a serious actor? Are you still getting ""The Hangover"" jokes when you wander the halls? __EOS__ People aren't accepting me, period, about anything. I mean, I had a hard enough time getting into the parties. ",1
50935," So right now as we're speaking, you are consciously... __EOS__ I'm trying to keep it soft. Yeah. __EOS__ Passable, as they say. Sometimes when I'm comfortable, I'm talking for a long time, I want to have to raise my volume. That's - I lapse back into boy mode with the voice more than I'd like to. __EOS__ And will you have the sex change operation or is this it? ",3
50936,"  Such as what? __EOS__  Mortar perhaps. Gibraltar. Perhaps Uganda. __EOS__ Winston? __EOS__  My dear Edward, if I thought we could get out of our present difficulties by giving up Malta, or Gibraltar or a view of the African colonies, I'd jump at it. But Hitler cannot be trusted. No point in talking with the . ",1
50937,"  These are monthly, but for Eastern Europe these are      pretty high salaries.  And... __EOS__  Now what do you do with the 30,000 cops you fired?  Are they      barred forever from becoming police officers?  Are they barred from      public employment?  What happens to them? __EOS__  No.  First of all, most of them did have savings      because they were corrupt and they had money.  You know, in the beginning      we had trouble recruiting people because many people would not take jobs      that had such a bad reputation.  Now there is a long line of applicants. __EOS__  Is the crime rate in Tbilisi lower today than it was three years      ago, say? ",3
50938," Yeah. __EOS__ ...telling stories. __EOS__ Well, no. I mean, I probably couldn't possibly have lived all the things that Ice-T and the records have lived. I did what I called faction. It was like factual situations, not always for me, but put into fictional settings. And that way I could create, you know, these great adventures and these great stories and all these things. So it had to happen to somebody. And, like, you would tell me a story about a brush with the law or something like that, and I would get all the details. And I would mix them with things that have happened to me, and that's what I would use for my material. But no, no, come on, I mean, I wouldn't be standing here today. I mean, Ice-T, in the music, has done some outrageous things. __EOS__ But it's interesting, some of the most compelling parts of your book, I thought, were the stories of going first to middle school then later high school in Los Angeles as this sort of wide-eyed kid from the suburbs of New Jersey... ",0
50939," Well, he did wear a sort of modified tuxedo at one point in his career. He did. __EOS__ Yeah, but it wasn't the singer, it's the song - your criteria for this arrangement. What was that criteria? __EOS__ We chose songs that had a certain lyrical elegance to them and a certain structural formality that is most beautifully revealed when you strip it down to its very basic elements. And there's no hiding behind a string quartet. And when you do something with chamber music instruments, the basic materials of the song are revealed. And when it's an astounding song, like this song, in which Marvin Gaye saw it all coming with the environmental crisis, the song has as much power and maybe even a little more power than the original just in that we hear something new in something we already thought we already knew everything about. __EOS__ You chose songwriters who were serious because you want the music to be taken seriously. ",2
50940," I don't know how unpleasant it was. You have to understand Beethoven's ever-progressing deafness that had manifested itself already around the age of 30. And deafness is the worst thing that could ever happen to a musician. __EOS__ Beethoven the heroic composer, Beethoven the dramatist, the fighter, the Michelangelo of music who wrote pieces like this… __EOS__ Or you know… __EOS__ The fifth symphony or the ""Eroica."" This is what people love about Beethoven, and they think all the works are like that, and nothing could be further from the truth. He was really capable of great lyricism, of tenderness. If you listen to the beginning of the sonata - Opus 101... ",2
50941," So is the Puente Hills model, the waste-to-energy model where waste is, you know, the methane gas is captured from the waste, and the gas is used to create electricity to power homes, is that a model that other landfills around the United States are picking up on?__EOS__ Yeah, there's - a number of privately run landfills have adopted some of these methods and are either making fuel or generating power with it. And it's a way of - once you have this landfill, and it's pumping out this methane, it's a way of sort of recapturing some of the value of the material in it. It's just not a particularly - an efficient way to make energy.__EOS__ Well, if you're just joining us, my guest is writer Edward Humes, and the author of the new book ""Garbology  Our Dirty Love Affair With Trash."" Let's take a short break here; then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Edward Humes. His new book is called ""Garbology  Our Dirty Love Affair With Trash.""",0
50942," Right. __EOS__ …is the gist of what you're saying. So if it's not a historical reference, what is it exactly? What is the book? __EOS__ On one hand, I think it's a look into the culture. What does this black world look like? But I also think of it as an art book. And I think these are really interesting artistic creations, which are posing very, very old aesthetic questions, which is about how does one represent that which cannot be represented? That's traditionally a question for mystical or religious art. But it's funny to see in this day and age those kind of artistic strategies being applied to classified military activities. __EOS__ Have you been contacted by any branch of the military about this book and about anything you've written in the book in a formal way? ",0
50943," So, yeah, we said okay, this is great. Call your housekeeper. Find out if she still has it. Turns out she lived up in Trenton, New Jersey. So at that point, my partner and I, we ran up to Trenton, New Jersey and we knocked on the door, and she still had the piece. And we went in and she said oh, yeah, we have it upstairs. So she takes us upstairs into her bedroom, and there's a young lady with blonde hair, very pretty, and she said, and here it is. And right on her dresser, the crystal ball was sitting on a little stand with a baseball cap on it. __EOS__ She had no clue, you know, what it was. __EOS__ And so in that case, no reason to doubt the good faith of anybody you talked to, right? __EOS__ Not those individuals. ",0
50944," Hey. I'm 23 years old. I've been a drummer for the past 15 years of my life. And, you know, it's the one thing I'm just never going to let go. __EOS__ I think, Robb, you might have some empathy for Riley? __EOS__ Absolutely. Riley, you know, if you believe in yourself and you really believe that you have what it takes, then just stick to it, man. It doesn't matter what anybody says. Just keep pounding, man. __EOS__ Keep pounding. What style do you play, Riley? ",2
50945,"  Oklahoma City? Damn. __EOS__  Yeah, right. He'll be back though, get tired of eating that food. __EOS__  You hear from him, tell him his chief is looking for him. __EOS__  Big Chief Lambreaux, huh? I heard George talk about you. ",2
50946,"  You're an accidental cocktail pianist. __EOS__  I'm an accidental cocktail pianist, exactly.  I started      when I was 17 years old, and I never intended to go into a bar and try to      get a job playing the piano.  I was on Nantucket Island for the summer.      I wanted to be a waitress.  I thought that was the ultimate in cool.  And      I was a waitress for two or three days and then I decided that I missed      the piano, that I needed to practice, and I went into a little place      called the Club Car on Main Street and I asked if I could practice there      in the mornings, just so my piano teacher didn't kill me when I got back      to school in the fall.  And there was a somewhat lecherous old Italian      man there named Lino Cappellino, member of the My-Name-is-a-Poem      Club, and he said, `Yeah, sure, you can practice here, honey.  Yeah, go      ahead.  Why don't you go play now?'  So I went to the back of the bar,      and there's this old beat-up upright piano with coffee stains and water      marks all over it and cigarette burns in the wood.  And I sat down, I      started to play, and he came back to the piano and said he would pay me      50 bucks a night to play there, starting that week. __EOS__  Oh, funny. __EOS__  That's why they're called fake books.  Yeah.  So he sent me      those and my mother threw in a couple of old prom gowns so that I had      something to wear, and off I went.  You know, when you're that age, you      sort of think you can do anything. ",2
50947," A Sports Agent Comes Clean on the Dirty Business of College Football."" Josh Luchs spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies.__EOS__ You know, much like it said on the cover of SI in October of 2010, I'll never forget the first time I paid a player. I had flown to Colorado to recruit a star defensive end pass rusher. You know, to give you some context, I had a hard time renting a car when I flew to Colorado, I was only 19 years old.__EOS__ And so what did you do?__EOS__ I told him I needed to think about it. This was the very first time that I'd even thought about doing something like that. So I left, and I made my list of pros and cons as to, you know, right and wrong and the benefit and the exposure and the issues. And at the end of the day, I decided that I'd go ahead, and I'd give him what he needed.",0
50948,"  Clean the suit anyway. I'm afraid he's mistaken.__EOS__ Kelly Macdonald got a role in the Danny Boyle film ""Trainspotting"" at the age of 19 with virtually no acting experience and launched a successful career in television and movies.

And the reason why I remember that one so well, it was the time of the year when you have to spend $300 to get your free turkey, and I still got my free turkey, only though I only spent 52 cents. __EOS__ How is that possible? __EOS__ Because coupons are money. So when you present them to the cashier, it's as if you're giving them your money. __EOS__ And how do you get these coupons? Do you mainly go online now? Or do you still use the circulars or the coupons that they give you at checkout, which sort of keeps track of what you buy? What do you primarily do now? ",3

50954," Right, so...__EOS__ ...Can, what? Stay for the weekend? How does it work?__EOS__ Each state has a slightly different arrangement, but basically these could be trailers or they could be small apartments. But, again, we need to understand that this is something that's given to people who are in medium to minimum-security facilities, with the idea being that it's very important for people to see their families because there's just so much evidence that shows that this is good for society in general.__EOS__ Well, is there any data to show that it, in fact, has this benefit?",3
50955," 1925, yeah. __EOS__ By Sergei Eisenstein, the famous Soviet filmmaker. And there's that scene, of course, with the baby carriage going down those steps in Odessa. How important was that film in sort of shaping the identity of the city? __EOS__ Well, I think Eisenstein's ""Battleship Potemkin"" is the film that really creates a modern image of what the city is, even though the film itself is a total imagination of... __EOS__ Fiction.

50956," Hi. Thanks very much.__EOS__ So Dexter, long before the report, we all knew that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was water boarded, but there's of course been a huge debate about whether or not these techniques got useful intelligence. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed probably had more important information in his head than just about any other captive I could think about. From what you've seen in the report, can you say if the torture got anything useful out of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?__EOS__ It looks like they got some useful information from him. But I think what's interesting about the Senate report, just to backup for second, is it's based on the CIA's internal communications. So it's basically quotations from emails and memos and cables of the CIA talking to itself. And in the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, they are talking about the interrogation as it's going on. And you can see what happens. To answer your question, there's a growing realization as the water boarding - 183 water boarding sessions - there's a growing realization that they're not really getting very much. I mean, they finally give up. The CIA is basically concluding that whatever it is that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has that's really valuable, they never got.__EOS__ And can you talk about some of the false information that came out of the water torture sessions?",3

He'll eat cow head tacos and just about anything else, and then he'll write about it on his blog. ""Man Bites World"" is his online chronicle of this culinary journey around the world. I joined him on day 70 at Azin's Afghani Restaurant in Pasedena. __EOS__ That's not going to be very indicative of the cuisine, you know, stealing someone else's recipe online and doing a bad dropped recreating it.

He would read, Glenn play solo , and then he'd start doing it. It was awesome.__EOS__ I'll play one now.",2
50962," Well, the idea of  - the whole idea of people coping with infertility comes not from my own experience as a father, but I have so many friends who've struggled with that, and I watched them go through so many procedures. And the pathos and the difficulty of that, and the toll that it took on their personal lives, the toll that it took on their marriage - it stuck with me forever. And the second place that it comes from is my own childhood fears that I just wasn't safe in my own house.__EOS__ Oh, can we follow up on that? What happened at home?__EOS__ Well, I mean, I hate to say it because my parents were completely blameless. They were just as sweet as can be and they did love me. But there's a time in a child's life, and I don't think I'm the only one, I know I'm not the only one who felt this, when you realize that, you know, A, they're separate people, and, B, that they have a life that doesn't include you, and C, they're very strict about your bedtime, and why are they so interested in getting you out of there? And my imagination just started to spin and spin and spin and the only thing I could come up with was that they were planning to do me in, in some way.__EOS__ And I did get past this, but it wasn't easy. And it lasted for a long time. And it was an idea that remained compelling to me because what could be more destabilizing than to feel that the only people who you really must trust in the world are not trustworthy?",0
50963,"  Number one, there must be an actual date to      properly begin a relationship and set the correct precedent. __EOS__  Number two, on this date, he must pay.      No exceptions.  If he doesn't have a lot of money, he needs to get      creative, but I'm not even going to front and reach for my wallet during      the initial six-week probationary period.  Most men who like to act      foolish can't hide it for more than six weeks.  Also, keep in mind that      stingy with the tip equals stingy with the gifts. __EOS__  That was Adrienne Carter and Tracy Richelle High.  They're two      of the four co-authors of ""FAB"" with Kieran Bats Morrow and Tiffany      Anderson.  Carter says like the characters in the novel, she and her      colleagues have managed to stay close across miles and years. __EOS__  It was sort of like through the miracle of the Internet we      were able to get this thing written and compiled.  Everybody was sort of      in a different place, and each person would write a chapter and then      e-mail it to the other three to get feedback.  You know, you'd sort of      write your comments on it and that's how things sort of worked out. ",0
50964," The Ike Turner scene was not a good scene for Andre Williams because everything was available, and Im the kind of guy that Ill overdo it, so when I went downhill with Ike, he just made everything available for me and it just got me in trouble, period. __EOS__ Williams kept writing songs for Parliament Funkadelic and others, but like lots of musicians, his compositions never made him rich, and his addictions made him homeless. He begged for change on a Chicago bridge for two years. __EOS__ I always had a, quote/unquote, ""white following,"" so I just decided to develop my stories and zero in on the kids because I dont have a, quote/unquote, ""black following."" All my following were foreign kids and Caucasians, which is great with me. You know, I dont have to play them ghetto joints. __EOS__ A full-length documentary about Andre Williams screened at the South by Southwest film festival last week. It can be tough to watch; Williams is jailed for drug possession and evicted from his tiny apartment. Even when hes touring, he looks spent and he drinks constantly. ",2
50965," Well, there are nerves which used to supply the fingers and hand which now supply the stump. But those nerves get irritated and misinform the brain that the hand is still there and surviving, and the nerves are painful. You get pain referred to the missing phantom hand. And based on this, therapies were devised where you remove the nerves or the terminals of the nerves which are curled up and painful. This often provides partial relief, but is usually notoriously ineffective. __EOS__ Right. So this person might feel an itch in his palm which he could scratch by touching the right spot on his face. And I guess one of the things this tells us is that the brain is growing new tissue as even - it doesn't just happen in embryo. I mean, it's - new things are happening, the brain is sort of remapping itself a bit as we grow older? __EOS__ Yes. I mean, what we were all taught as medical students say a decade or two ago was that connections in the fetal brain, or an infant brain, are fixed during infancy or fetal life by the genome - by genes. And then as you grow into adulthood, the maps crystallize and are there permanently. And you can't do anything but change these - alter these maps. And if there's injury to the brain, the injury is permanent and there's very little recovery or function after tissue damage to the brain. __EOS__ OK. Let's talk about this remarkable treatment that you developed for people who have had amputations and may have terrible pain in their phantom limb, and a treatment that you did with a simple mirror. Explain what you had your subject do. ",0
50966," Laswell has a gift for appealing melodies that float and meander, never quite cementing into consistent, repetitive lines. And since he plays almost all the instruments on the album himself, he had full control of exactly how his songs were presented. __EOS__  Your love.  all of your story... __EOS__ One of his decisions was to present the new songs without revealing too much personal detail. __EOS__ And there's a bunch of songs that, you know, I listened them to later and I'm like well, it's just too sensational and it's too selfish of me to put this on a record, you know. ",2
50967," Well, so the point is it doesn't do any good to throw it all into this big benevolence vat and make all religions and all beliefs and so forth the same. So I'm not trying to do that at all. At the same time, Christopher and I get on very well on a personal level. But both - part of it, I think, it's because good fences make good neighbors. And we both understand that the other person really believes what they believe. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. At the end of this documentary, or around the end of it, Christopher Hitchens says something that was very interesting. You were asked whether - if you had the opportunity to eliminate the last religious person on earth, you wouldn't do it… __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ …you wouldn't pull the trigger. ",1
50968," No. Nope. It's still the good, old Edmund Pettus Bridge. He was a Confederate general and, yes, KKK Grand Dragon of the time around when it was built. And so regrettably, that is still the name, that bridge.__EOS__ Ava DuVernay, we'll talk more about directing the film ""Selma"" in the second half of the show. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Ava DuVernay, the director of the new film, ""Selma,"" that dramatizes a turning point in civil rights history when Martin Luther King came to Selma, Alabama to lead a series of voting rights marches that collided with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. When DuVernay came on as the film's director, she re-wrote the screenplay. When we left off, we were talking about filming what's known as Bloody Sunday, when demonstrators in a peaceful voting rights march were attacked and chased by police.__EOS__ So young, so young.",1
50969," Well, you'd have to see it in context, but, in fact, so many of my books either have to do with war or have characters who have been through war, that I guess it goes back to the mindset. __EOS__ And that basic theme, in your case, goes back to that year in Vietnam. __EOS__ Yeah, that's correct. I was sort of an unwilling soldier, but once you're there, of course, what you do is fight. __EOS__ And your experience in that conflict, you had written a couple of stories before you went to war. What were they about? ",0
50970," Loriene, this is a good time to bring you in. I think a lot of people might be listening to this conversation saying well, that's fine, you know, if you've got 300 bucks to enroll your kid in a program at the local university, which is what they cost in this area - there are summer reading programs that are great, but they are pricey. So what about the libraries?__EOS__ Well, this is a really fortuitous time to talk about the impact of summer reading. And one reason is that last week, the final study of a three- year research project on the impact of summer reading programs on student achievement was released. And this is called the Dominican Study. It was coordinated by Dominican University's Graduate School of Library and Information Science. So for the past three years they've been watching, interviewing students, teachers, parents and looking at what has happened as an impact of kids involved in summer reading program. And they have more evidence now that it resolves in children's scores and standardized testing increasing, teachers reporting kids' increased confidence in reading, participating in classroom activities. So it extends beyond the summer into the school year.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, you're listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm speaking with Jolene Ivey, Dani Tucker, Loriene Roy and Ron Fairchild. We're talking about the summer brain drain, where the kids have a drop off in achievement over the summer and what we can do that.__EOS__ I use my, what I always talk about, my family, friends and network - the moms who don't work or who do, who Imani rides to - happen to the library and the activities with the mom that doesn't work during the day. And then, you know, we help out where we can when I'm not working. But just with DeVaughn, he can do his own. But with her, exactly, just put her in with other people who are going that way. Or she rides the bus. You know, she rides the bus right now.",3
50971," …ends up hanging out with the townies, the people live in town, either go to school or they don't, but a different class of people than you imagine the upper-class kids from out of town. __EOS__  When there weren't any parties, she parked by the quarry, walked into the woods until she came to a clearing where townies would gather and drink until blackout, smoke cigs till they're sick,  and then pass out. __EOS__ This song does make me think of class differences. You've got this woman who is doing pretty well. She's in college. She's got a good future. She can go drink and mess around, and it's okay. She's going to be fine. But she's hanging out with these people for whom this is the high point of life, and that's about all there is. __EOS__ Yeah. And I think there's also that age there, too, where you realize you might be fooling around or thinking something as low stakes. But in an instant, things can get sort of strange and really make a big impact on the rest of your life. ",2
50972," And we're joined now by the actor who plays that noble and brave Ernest Hemingway, Corey Stoll, to be exact. Welcome to the program.__EOS__ Thanks. Good to be here.__EOS__ Tell me about playing Ernest Hemingway for Woody Allen.__EOS__ Well, I mean, just that phrase itself sends chills down my spine. It was a complete joy. And I had a couple months to prepare for the role. So I just gorged myself on pretty much everything I could get. I just read his whole oeuvre.",1
50973,"  He wants me to fix it. He wants me to fix it like one of my hair dryers. __EOS__  And did you? __EOS__  I tried. I tried. I called. She wouldn't take my call. I go over there. I try to talk to her. She's crying. __EOS__  Why is she crying? She's scared, somebody's after her? ",1
50974," He was our hero long before anyone knew who we were, simply because when we first signed with Crouch Productions, and we were a part of Crouch Productions - well, we could never get a date as to when we would go into the studio to record. And so Dad just couldn't take it no more and he said we're going to California. And they'll have to record when we're on the doorstep. And when we showed up, then they said well okay, and we got into the studio and that's how ""The Question Is"" came. __EOS__  Now, the question is, will I do his will? And it's yes, yes, yes, whoa, yes… __EOS__ After launching their careers, Pop watched as his sons went on to win six Grammy awards as the Winans and became one of the most popular gospel quartets of all time. And other Winans groups followed  BB & CC, Angie & Debbie, even the grandkids started a singing group. But as a preacher and singer in his own right, it also brought David Winans joy to share the mic with his children. Here's Pop Winans singing ""If I Labor"" with the Winans. __EOS__  If I labor, God is gonna give me a crown, yes he will, a crown. If I labor, God is gonna give me a crown, yes he will, a crown. No. I believe I'll work in the vineyard. Sun is going down. ",2
50975," Oh yeah, and they have been documented in places like Massachusetts and Chicago. So, yeah, they have been  not that the large majority because of the dates where this was going on, that has been reported, but, yes, it has affected Latino communities. __EOS__ Michael, I wonder if  has Catholicism been on the decline in the U.S.? And is  and are these allegations and scandals partly to blame? __EOS__ Actually, it's still one of the few congregations that continues to grow. I think a lot of it has to do with immigration. But you  and these are damning allegations. Of course they hurt the church and most especially because it's self-inflicted. You know, there's  I was thinking this morning, you know, Richard Nixon kept an enemy's list. And it turns out none of his enemies did as much damage to that man as his staff. __EOS__ Professor, you said that this was making it uncomfortable for the Latinos in the church, are many of them leaving it? ",3
50976," Well, they are worried. And I think Greenspan's comments from two days ago didn't help where he talked about the possibility of a recession. __EOS__ This is the former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, of course. __EOS__ And not that it was a great surprise. Almost all of us thought there is a possibility of a recession late this year. But, you know, when he says it, people notice. __EOS__ Were there are other factors here? There was talk about a computer glitch in the middle of the day that made it appear that stocks had suddenly plunged another 100 points in the middle of the day. ",3
50977," Gockley says a local Catholic radio show did cancel an interview with Adamo. But there were no protests when he conferred with local priests and rabbis.__EOS__ I'm kind of waiting for some kind of kerfuffle to happen around this, but yet the natives are quiet.__EOS__ The theater is a safe place to talk about risky things.__EOS__ Composer Mark Adamo and Gockley expect a good number of journalists and many an opera director to be in the audience opening night. And Adamo hopes audiences will see that he's not trying to scorn the tradition.",2
50978," The tradition started in 1991 and you know, holidays are a great time to get together with family and friends, but they can also be really stressful. So a friend of mine was looking for - kind of a release after one of the more stressful family events, and we went to the local White Castle and had a contest to see who could eat as many sliders as we could. __EOS__ And the record is? __EOS__ The record is 17 cheeseburgers, not just regular hamburgers. __EOS__ And that has not been topped? ",3
50979," I don't know. I don't think that that's fairly true. I think it is fair to say that ""The Iliad"" has always been to me, very relevant and very personal. And once we entered a war period, in our own historic times, I saw as I've always seen resonances between certain events that I was reading about and things that I knew from ""The Iliad."" __EOS__ This is a few years ago. __EOS__ This is a few years ago. And there's a wonderful scene in ""The Iliad,"" towards the end, when Hector's widow says, something has happened. May what I say never come close to my ear. In other words, if I can not say the word, maybe it won't happen. But terribly, I fear that my bold Hector has been cut off on his own on the plain. And then she goes... __EOS__ And, Hector, of course, is killed by Achilles outside... ",0
50980," Roll with me, Henry.__EOS__ Any old time.__EOS__ Roll with me, Henry.__EOS__ Won't change my mind.",2
50981," Yeah, I'm going to let you mash. __EOS__ I love mashing. __EOS__ Our sweet potato pound cake batter is thick, a pretty, pale orange. __EOS__ This is the one-hour-and-15-minute one that I got. ",0
50982," Well, she definitely touched a nerve.__EOS__ Yes. Yes.__EOS__ Something tells me we'll be talking about this again.__EOS__ Oh yes.",3
50983," I think because it kind of refers to a more kind of black entertainment head space, kind of like almost a ""Five Guys Named Moe,"" type of ""Straighten Up and Fly Right,"" Slim and Slim. That's the music that my parents grew up with. It gives me that feeling, and it's fun, you know. __EOS__ And before we hear it, why don't you just take a second to introduce all the members of the band? __EOS__ All right, solid. On piano, Uri Caine. Our vocalist is Dean Bowman. Steve Alcott on bass. Richie Schwarz on drums. Bob DeBellis is playing alto and tenor saxophones. And Charlie Lewis is playing trumpet. All right. __EOS__  One, two, one, two, uh-uh-uh. ",2
50984,"  Long as you got a little gravy on your rice you figure everything gonna wind up real nice. As long as you got a little watermelon hanging on the vine you figure everything gonna turning out real fine. Lazy bones, sleepin' in the sun. How you expect to get your day's work done? __EOS__ Now, I noticed you didn't hesitate to add some of your own lyrics here and there. __EOS__ Hey, that's what I think - I do that with anything. I've been shucking my way through people's stuff for years. And pray that when I do throw something in the game that I - it was 'cause I meant it. And I don't they would've objected. __EOS__ Tell me about your song on here, I Ain't No Johnny Mercer. It's the song that you wrote as a tribute. ",2
50985," But you're going to try to influence that choice by penalizing people if they don't have health insurance. There would be, I gather, a two and a half percent tax effectively… __EOS__ Well, look, everybody needs to have health insurance. It's sort of like everybody has to have automobile insurance. And the reason for that is that we know accidents are inevitable, and we know as well that illness is inevitable - not for everybody all the time. But at some point in time in our lives, we're going to need health care. And if they can't afford the full boat, then they'll get some help. But we believe, not only do we need to bring cost down, but one way to do it is to have everybody participate and share the burden more broadly. __EOS__ Yours is a huge bill in the House. A Senate health subcommittee - or committee has reported out a bill. The Senate Finance Committee has not yet chimed in on how the Senate would want to fund their bill. Can all of this actually get done by September or October? Or is this going to leak well into the end of this year? __EOS__ No, I think the answer to that question is a very definite yes, it can be done. And not only can it be done, it's our, certainly, intention to get it done within that time frame. This issue has been, frankly, six decades in the making. And it's an issue on which President Obama made certain pledges, and the Democrats made certain pledges - but the Republicans also said was necessary to pursue. Obviously, there are differences on how you get to where we need to get. But I think certainly, we can do so in the time frame of this year. And that's our intention. ",3
50986," I mean, that actually is not bad advice.__EOS__ Yeah, actually, there's a lot of common sense, good advice wrapped up in a bunch of silly things in this book that a lot of people are loving, and they love, this book is a fun read and, but there are so many nuggets buried in it.__EOS__ But, so do you think that, what do you think is driving the popularity of Madea as a character, both in the plays and in the movie? I mean, do you think that in this era of anything goes that in a way people are secretly looking for somebody to tell them what to do, to kind of put the, you know, put your skirt down.__EOS__ Yeah, and again, and put your skirt down.",0
50987," ...and the people who dealt with the fishes and the people on the ships. And I'm thinking like...__EOS__ I know.__EOS__ ...this is like huge group of people working on the film, and you're like the only person ever on camera. And that must have been such an odd position.__EOS__ When we - when I saw that, you know, I've only seen the film once. I was at the Cannes...",3
50988," My hope is that they bring their own lives to it; that they're not just hung up on the back story of the deaths of these people, because it's not a tribute record. But it is about the terrain of lost grief. And loss is not just one thing. I mean, it's also anger, and it's also liberation and the renegotiation of these relationships. You know, because I don't think that a relationship between parent and child ends when one person leaves the body. It goes on but you've got to find the new terms. __EOS__ And you supply both ends of the tangible conversation. __EOS__ Yes, so I'm more in control. I like that. __EOS__ Black Cadillac came before you were kind of pitched into this experience, and tell us what was in your mind at first. ",2
50989," That is so Rich Phillips.__EOS__ Yes, just for our audience, we just heard Captain Richard Phillips. He is the real Merchant Marine captain who was kidnapped by Somali pirates in 2009. His story is the basis of the film ""Captain Phillips,"" and we're speaking with Tom Hanks, who stars in the film as Captain Phillips, and Paul Greengrass, its director. So Tom Hanks, tell us about this guy and how you got a fix on him.__EOS__ Well, he's actually a very happy-go-lucky, funny, goofy guy, and even that recollection of the clip is almost like he has a humorous pragmatism about everything that he's been through and that he went through. You find out, like for example from Andrea, his wife, there was a time that she would go visit him when he was working, and she stopped doing it long ago because as soon as he steps onboard the ship as the captain, he becomes just the opposite. He is no-nonsense, he is a stickler for detail, he is a pain in the neck to almost everybody that he comes in contact with.__EOS__ Yeah, so you saw him in conversation. How did you get the Richie Phillips that's the captain, who's on deck, in command?",3
50990," So, I'm going to ask you all to do a song that Bill Monroe wrote but that was also recorded by Elvis. And I think this is a song that bridges all of your - the music that you liked when you were a teenager because you loved bluegrass, you loved Elvis. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ So you must've known both of these versions - both of their versions. __EOS__ Well, I heard Elvis's version first, you know. And while I was playing with Bill Monroe, an interviewer asked him if, you know, bluegrass is always held to be like this sacred purity of, you know, country music and roots and it is for sure. But Bill fielded the question of whether he thought Elvis had ruined his, you know, bluegrass. This was from a journalist who was holding Bill in very high esteem. And he said Mr. Monroe, do you think Elvis ruined your song ""Blue Moon of Kentucky""? And Bill said, no sir, them are powerful checks. ",2
50991," Is this something of a turning point for Muslim leaders in the U.S.? Because right after 9/11, Muslim leaders protested against attitudes in the U.S. __EOS__ I do believe that still there's a lot to be done in this country regarding backlash, and Muslims, and some laws, and other things like that. And American experience, it shows that some people before us have went through hard times in America, but they overcome through means of dialogue, participating in the political process, being able to create an alliances with other people, reaching out to other people, and that's what we are doing here in the United States. __EOS__ Imam Magid, thank you for speaking with us. __EOS__ It's my pleasure. ",3
50992," Right, right, and there's a question about whether even the cap and trade part of this would be stripped out and maybe just a kind of, you know, green jobs legislation be pushed through, which would include subsidies for clean energy technology and things like that and various other  perhaps a renewable portfolio standard which would mandate a certain amount of clean energy from various sources on a timetable. __EOS__ Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, has offered a measure to strip the EPA of its power to regulate carbon emissions. What would this measure do? __EOS__ Well, this is really an important move on her part because the finding from the Supreme Court that greenhouse gases are actually a dangerous pollutant and that the EPA has the authority to regulate this pollutant is really important, and that decision came last year, and it was really the stick that got a lot of the energy industry to the table on cap and trade and got them engaged, because if there's one thing that the fossil fuel industry does not want, is the EPA in their lives. __EOS__ You know, so we've been talking about legislation that has stalled in the Senate that is focused around cap and trade, but it's not just the energy industry. It's not just Republican opponents and Democrats from energy states who oppose cap and trade. There are some environmentalists that think cap and trade really isn't going to be a very effective system. What's the environmentalist argument against cap and trade? ",0
50993," Yeah?__EOS__ Basically, I don't know how to reconcile this job I have as a musician with this desire to be a guy who stays at home. I even tattooed it on my arms - Home Life - as some sort of like, thug life alternative tattoo.__EOS__ There's a song on this album that, to me, sort of speaks to that tension; called  ""Dear Marie.""__EOS__ Yeah.",2
50994," The producers, I think, were very sensitive, Timberland, Rodney Jerkins, were very sensitive to the history of Michael Jackson. And that's really what this is in some ways, is it's not a historical document but it is enrichment of our sense of his history.__EOS__ And what do we know about these discoveries? Were these just lying around in a studio somewhere?__EOS__ Michael Jackson made many, many demos. He was always working. I think that's part of his tragedy, really. He worked himself to the end of his life. After he died, the Jackson estate made a deal with Sony to recreate some of those demos as fresh music, and that's what we're hearing. Now, this was not the first. There was another album like this in 2010 and I have a feeling it won't be the last.__EOS__ One of the most fascinating aspects of this release is that you can hear both what he did originally and then contrast that with what the producers did with the original material. You can get this on the deluxe version and also on Spotify. And, you know, the originals almost seem like pencil sketches rather than full portraits. Let's listen to a clip of ""Love Never Felt So Good."" This is the produced version.",2
50995,"  Thing you don't drudge, thing you don't rub, thing you don't kill, thing you don't kill, thing you don't mix and  and crack, thing you don't smoke, man, crack no, no. Who dem, who dem,  Rastaman...__EOS__ Reggae runs deep in South Africa. During the 1970s, songs by Peter Tosh and Burning Spear were gospel to the anti-apartheid movement. James Mange, a reggae artist and former resistance leader was the first Rastafarian prisoner on Robben Island, alongside such anti-apartheid activists as Walter Sisulu and Nelson Mandela. Mange says they were huge reggae fans.__EOS__ Walter Sisulu even asked for certain albums in particular - say, that one by that boy, what is his name? We'd say Bob Marley. Say which one? We've got about three. ""Exodus,"" give me that one.__EOS__  Wipe away transgressions,  free. Exodus...",2
50996," And... __EOS__ I'm sorry. I'm trying to hold myself back from laughing because I want the record to show I'm appalled by all of this, but the guacamole just - the guacamole line gets me. __EOS__ Obviously, it was not politically correct, but everyone took part in it, and we were just enjoying doing what we were doing. We were in advertising and it was fun, and we thought the music would never end. __EOS__ How's the rise of women in the workplace - not just the ad business -changed advertising? ",0
50997," Thanks having me on.__EOS__ Go ahead.__EOS__ I would highly recommend ""The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress"" by Robert Heinlein.__EOS__ Oh, that's interesting. You're a science fiction geek. Max Brooks, would you endorse that one? Or I think most people would fight over ""Stranger in a Strange Land.""",0
50998," Could you envision a world in which English and Spanish disappear and blend into some form of Spanglish? Some… __EOS__ Hopefully not. Hopefully not. It's, linguists would kill us for saying that Spanglish should be the official of the United States. But no, what I envision is a country… __EOS__ But, hold on, hold on. What's wrong with that, if that's what the people want? Why is it so awful? __EOS__ No, I mean, linguistically and grammatically, it just is so difficult. No, I wouldn't say it sounds awful, but it's what people are speaking so I'm all for it, of course. ",3

Andrew with us from Cleveland in Ohio. __EOS__  Yes. Hi, Neal. Thanks for taking my call. __EOS__  Go ahead please. __EOS__  Yes, just this past Democratic convention Bill Clinton's speech to the Democratic Convention this year I thought was simply amazing. They laid out everything he had to do before it all the pundits like he was an Olympic gymnast, you know, this is his routine, this is what he had to accomplish, and especially the line that I'll take from it was that America must lead by the power of example not the example of its power.

And we acted it out in front of the class. Yeah, and right then we kind of figured that we'd be pals. You know, we were into acting out war scenes, and...__EOS__ We used to meet downtown. We lived in a town where they had a farmer's market and the shoeshine stands and Mennonite farmers selling their wares and sidewalk preachers and things that were trappings of an older time. And even back then, it seemed like everything that we did together had a song to it. And that was even before we started making music together.__EOS__ You guys come together, you and Critter, and you're busking in Boone, North Carolina as I understand it. That's where you were really discovered for the first time.__EOS__ Oh, it must have been 12 or 13 years since we met Doc on the fifth of July in Boone, North Carolina.",2
51001," Isn't it amazing how the period of being mute probably in its own way helped you to become the writer that you are?__EOS__ Absolutely.__EOS__ How did you start to speak again after you stopped?__EOS__ Well Mrs. Flowers, a lady in it in my town, a black lady, had started me to reading when I was about eight. Really reading. I was already reading but she started me to reading in the black school and I read all the books in the black school library. And she had some contact with the white school and she would bring books to me and I would just eat them up.",0
51002," You know, my job is not to justify Winnie, only Winnie can do that herself. And that was never my aim in taking on this role. But my aim is to really document and show her arc, her journey, the truth of that, as faithfully as I possibly can, and the emotional reality behind that. She made certain choices. She did certain things, and, you know, some of them seem, on the face of it, really awful things to have done. But when you really show her journey and how she reached those decisions, then I think they become more understandable. They may not become ever palatable, but at least understandable. And that's what I wanted to do in playing this role. I wanted to just really give her an opportunity to have a fair hearing in a way.__EOS__ So what's next for you? Going to be kind of tough to go back to being a Bond girl after being Winnie Mandela.__EOS__ Well, that is what's next. Yes, I go back to playing Moneypenney in the next Bond.__EOS__ Really? Well, a heroine of a different order.",1
51003," Yes. And one of the things about this new plane, the 787, you say in the film - there's an awful of lot engineering that goes on in this film. It's not just about the romance of flying, but a lot of engineering and how the revolutions in computers and, course, in the construction of carbon fiber, which is talking over from aluminum. These are big revolutions in airplane design. But nevertheless, they make it possible to have a better experience for the passenger. How so? __EOS__ Well, we think so. So when you take the material properties of the carbon fiber, you can do different things with the wings. You can make active control systems that help reduce the weight. If you reduce the weight of the airplane, you reduce the amount of fuel burned to move the airplane around. With the fatigue life of carbon structures, you can pressurize the airplane to higher pressure so the passengers have more oxygen. Because the carbon doesn't corrode, you can retain more humidity inside the airplane so that people don't get sort of dried out. __EOS__ Well, having more oxygen in the plane means you won't go to sleep quite so quickly either. __EOS__ Yeah. Well, one of the airplanes I got to fly for the Seattle Museum of Flight was the 1933 Boeing 247. And I got to speak to a captain  it was in his logbook, he had flown it for a Pennsylvania airline in 1940. He says, yeah, we used to love it because we climb up about 14,000 feet and just put all the passengers to sleep. ",1
51004," Yeah. __EOS__ ...when you come right down to it. __EOS__ But nevertheless, there's a lot of the book that spends its time attacking the current system - current 18, excuse me, 1760 or so - mercantilism. __EOS__ Yes. I mean, one of the - there are five books. ""Wealth of Nations"" is actually five books. And one whole book of that is devoted essentially to attacking mercantilism. And it would be nice to say this was beating a dead horse, but in point of fact, the idea of mercantilism - the idea that you should import more than you export, and that the way a country gets rich is by importing, excuse me, is by exporting everything and importing money - it's an idea that animates the entire government of China. It's an idea that panics and terrifies all of the good-great-gray thinkers about economics in the United States.  ",0
51005," change and experience. You may not get both in the candidates, but you do in Safire's Political Dictionary. This guide to the uses and abuses of political language in America has gotten its first update in 15 years. __EOS__ Greetings, Renee. __EOS__ Now, let me put you on the spot. What is the best new word or phrase? __EOS__ Well, the trouble with that is that it takes a couple of months to get a book out. And as soon as you get a dictionary out, wham, new words come flying in. And I'm sitting here making notes already for the next edition. ",0
51006," Well, he used to describe it to me as being like a small town, and I really didn't understand this growing up in Los Angeles, but, you know, it is true. It was really isolated. You know, at a time before commercial jet travel, when you were - would have to take a train to the East Coast and a journey of at least five days. And, you know, there was also just a feeling - it had always been called the movie colony, you know, when actors in the silent era first started coming out there.__EOS__ So one of your favorite films that your father was in from that period is the 1932 movie ""Three on a Match,"" and this featured Bette Davis, Joan Blondell and Ann Dvorak. And they played, like, three young women who light their cigarettes using the same match, three on a match, and they discuss the superstition that this is going to bring them bad luck, which it does.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ So here's the scene where Ann Dvorak and your father meet.",3
51007," Well, the numbers will, the numbers are going to tell you essentially what you paid for your ticket. Not exactly, but they'll give the crew and everybody else a pretty good sense of whether you're a full-paying first-class or coach flyer, which is a very high priority for the airlines, or whether you are an award ticket holder, as used to say, a free ticket, although they're not really free anymore because you're paying fees for those free tickets, or whether you're a discount flyer who's on a low-fare, long in advance purchased ticket.__EOS__ But once I get onto the plane, no one ever looks at my ticket, so how do they know what my number is?__EOS__ Well, there's a manifest that, it's usually a printed-out piece of paper that is handed by the gate agent to the flight attendant on most airlines, showing each of the passengers by name, certainly in the premium classes anyway, the first and business classes, and showing whether they paid full fare, how elite they are and some other information about them.__EOS__ My guest is Mark Gerchick, author of the new book ""Full Upright and Locked Position  Not-So-Comfortable Truths About Air Travel Today."" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.",0
51008," You can't be judging something as you do it. You have to have judged it before; maybe you can judge it after, but not during. During it youre just committed. Youre doing something. Youre not thinking. __EOS__ So getting back to when you switched roles with Raul Julia as you were making ""Kiss of the Spider Woman,"" and you became the... __EOS__ You are insistent. __EOS__ Well, I just want to know what you got from it. You became the political prisoner and he became... ",1
51009," Why? __EOS__ I just think it's - I just have a different pace to my life now than I did then. It was much more go, go, you know, turning on all cylinders. It's much easier for me to kick back now, and I think what really makes a great parent, especially now that I am a parent, is the ability to kick back and be with it and enjoy it because I think it's all - that's what a kid is all about. __EOS__ Let's get back to telling jokes. __EOS__ Okay. ",0
51010," Do you feel like a hero? __EOS__ Not really, because I always protect my sisters and I have brothers, too, so I protect them too. I'm the oldest of six. So it's pretty much a daily job for me. __EOS__ Big brother in the house. How do you feel, by the way, about the video  The Gregory Brothers who produced that music video of you and your sister's words? __EOS__ Well, you know, the guy hasn't been caught yet, but us hearing that video, it had gave us some type of happiness. It gave us some type of comfort, because out of this all  that video, we really liked it. Like, it was really cool, especially to hear our voice on the track. And, you know, it's on iTunes and everything. That was really cool and it did bring some happiness. ",3
51011,"  Or he doesn't want you to see his face.__EOS__  Because he's  ugly.__EOS__  OK, what's his story?__EOS__  Oh, that's Lurch.",1
51012," Jeff, youve been reporting on this Ugandan anti-homosexual bill from the United States. But recently you actually went to Uganda. What did you hope to learn there? __EOS__ Well, I went, really, to meet with David Bahati, the author of the bill. Because I'd been reporting on it, we ended up speaking. And he invited me to Uganda. He said, look, if you come here, you'll see yourself whats really going on. For instance, you'll see that homosexuals from Europe and America are luring our children into homosexuality by distributing cell phones and iPods and things like this - that no Ugandan on his or her own would ever become gay, but they're sort of bribed into it. __EOS__ How did he know your work? __EOS__ FRESH AIR, actually. ",3
51013," I'm not a good writer. I do not find words very easy. I love melodies and I can sing with passion but words don't come that easy to me. And so that's why I kind of - I didn't want to be a journalist - because I just didn't think I was a very good writer. And ironically now, I am a songwriter.__EOS__  Say you love me to my face. I need you more than your embrace.__EOS__ On the song ""Say You Love Me,"" the writing is very lovely and very straightforward.__EOS__ Yeah.",2
51014," There are several ways to approach the making of a gospel album. One way would be to lay on the fire, brimstone, and damnation. Another would be to rely on the positive Christian message of salvation. For this album, Del and his son Rob McCoury say that they made a clear choice as to the kind of gospel they wanted to do. __EOS__ It's more uplifting than anything, you know? __EOS__ Yeah, there's no sense scaring people with the record. __EOS__ The music on this album is far from scary. Their sound resonates all over the social spectrum, from suspendered to good old boys, to button down yuppies, to tie-dyed neo-hippy dead heads. I wondered if they ever worried about alienating some of their fans with the strong Christian message. ",2

51016," Yes, yes, and I was inundated with students and visitors and all of that because there's a fascination to this, and they all - well, they're all happy to be - to see something like this and realize that when I started and where I started is where they are and that they can do something. And that ought to be the goal  school, learn and then use your own abilities to go further.__EOS__ Do they realize that? Do they understand that?__EOS__ I know some did. Now others I think are still thinking I'm going to quickly grab a degree and get a fantastic job and get rich, but I don't think they're thinking beyond getting rich. Now I don't know if that's a good life.__EOS__ Well, congratulations to you, Nick.",3
51017," I'm almost positive she's listening right now. __EOS__ She's very proud. But I would chalk that up to an amazing mother. She's, you know, my biological parents divorced when I was right - I think right around the time I turned one and my mother remarried my stepdad when I was five and - right after I turned five. And so, you know, there was a period of time where I had to get used to sort of a man that wasnt related to me by blood. And you know, she always made everything so comfortable for me and she always spoke to me like I was her peer. __EOS__ Well, Justin Timberlake, it's been great to talk with you. Thank you so much for being on our show. __EOS__ Thank you. I'm such a fan and I... ",1

51019," You're welcome.__EOS__ I - when I was about four or five years old, I developed the mumps and - in my left ear. I wound up with a 55, 60 percent hearing loss that was diagnosed at the time as what they would call a nerve deafness. Now, I'm just curious - it's gotten worse over the years. And I just would like to know from your guest if there have been any advances, they even still use that term, nerve deafness, and if there have been any other advances other than a cochlear implant that are kind of hanging out there.__EOS__ Let me see if I can...__EOS__ I did hear that.",0

I don't have any real memories from that time besides hallucinations.__EOS__ Right. So what were your sources when you decided to piece this back together? Because, you know, you had a loving family that were really invested in your care.__EOS__ Luckily I did, and, you know, they were extremely valuable to being able to re-create this time. You know, I started with the objective evidence, which was the medical records. And I had thousands of pages of medical records to work with. And then from there I also had video of myself in the hospital. I mean, video of myself having a hallucination.",0

51023," What's today? __EOS__ …the answer I have at the moment is my parents were playing a cruel joke on me. In Australia, we don't say counterclockwise, we say anticlockwise. So if you say Andy Clockwise, it's kind of a play on words, if you look at it like that. __EOS__ Oh, okay. So that's an Australian joke we wouldn't really get here. __EOS__ Kind of, yeah. It's lost in translation, if you know what I mean. ",2
51024,"  I want to get back to mortality.  How much time would you say, in your typical day, you spend thinking about death? __EOS__  At this point, Terry, I probably spend almost no time thinking about death.  For the first time in my life, I am living completely in the present.  I have, as I said about a terminal illness where you have time, in a sense, it allows you to sort of co-script your final act.  To be able to write ""Love and Death"" was to be able to put a code on my life.  I have been able to conclude my active life,  as opposed to it just ending.   __EOS__  Reverend Church, thank you so much for talking with us, and I wish you the best. __EOS__  Well, thank you, Terry.  It's been a great pleasure to be on your show. ",0
51025," Laurel Masse, how did you come across Killian and his mother, Barbara Mansfield, the Mansfield family? __EOS__ I'm one of the instructors at Jay Ungar and Molly Mason's Swing Music Camp. And Killian first showed up three years ago. I mean, he was clearly already ill, and he was not stopped by that at all. And because he was not stopped by that at all, the people around him were not stopped by that at all. __EOS__ Tell me about where the idea for this record, ""Somewhere Else,"" came from. How did it come about? __EOS__ Killian had spent a horrendous hospitalization, during which time we thought that he would not be coming home from the hospital. ",2
51026," And then, another thing is I have some Grana Padano in the freezer that was old. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ But I'm going to take it out again pretty soon and use it but it's kind of slimy. __EOS__ Ooh. ",0
51027," Yeah, really.__EOS__ So let's hear ""Young and Lovely"" from Jherek Bischoff's new album ""Composed.""__EOS__  I lost a little weight and might have lied about my age, and nine months to the day my name escapes you. And you seem so surprised, and I've seen neither hair nor hide, a sight for sunken eyes. It's nice to see you. What, what's the rush? You've said too much. Unsure of what's stirred such a fuss. You've heard enough from those of us no longer young nor lovely enough for love. Try not to scream, as strange as that must seem. It's best not to breathe, I know that's hard to believe. Just don't make a scene, at least until she leaves.__EOS__ That's ""Young and Lovely"" from Jherek Bischoff's album ""Composed,"" and we heard Zac Pennington and Soko singing. Jherek Bischoff sings on one track but not that one.",2
51028," …my peers who grew up in that same, you know, community. There is some sense of, you know, like, oh, well I'm supposed to do well because of this or that. You got to earn it, you know? I think that's sort of - that period really helped me lose any sense of entitlement I might have had. __EOS__ Can I ask what kind of work your parents did? __EOS__ Yeah, my father is a lawyer and my mom, my mom raised us. __EOS__ Mm hmm. So, when, how old were you when you knew you wanted to be an actor and how did you know?

51030," I once did a story about a six-year-old boy in Utah who was about to embark on a remarkable journey. Here's how that story began  __EOS__ Among the rows of small cornsilk-blond and haystack-brown heads squirming through reading lessons in Mrs. Bigler's first-grade class at the Oak Hills Elementary School in Bountiful, Utah, one small boy stands out among all the Ashleys, Cassies, Laurens and Chrises. __EOS__  If you were an animal, what would you be? Where would you go and what would you see? __EOS__ Tenzin Dhongha's hair is as black as coal. His eyes are Asian. But in all important respects, he is one with his classmates, fidgeting if the classroom clock ticks too slowly towards recess. But Tenzin Dhongha, this six-year-old boy, draws occasional visitors to Bountiful because he has been proclaimed by Tibet's spiritual and temporal leader, the Dalai Lama himself as a tulku, a miracle being, the reincarnation of his grandfather, the high Tibetan Buddhist lama Goma Rimpoche. ",2
51031," Well, the thing about that is that it sounds like Pythagoras' theorem. So he gets it all wrong. It sounds right, but it's wrong. And he's actually quoting the scarecrow from ""The Wizard of Oz"" - because when the scarecrow gets his diploma, he reels off exactly the same equation. It sounds impressive, but it's actually all wrong.__EOS__ And you say in the book that your judgment is, it was calculatedly wrong because of the way Ray Bolger must have had to rehearse to be able to make that recitation.__EOS__ Yes. If it got one word wrong, then you would think it's just a slip-up. But the fact that he got so many different elements wrong makes me think that the writers did it deliberately, to give a sense of the fact that OK, the scarecrow had a diploma. So he didn't really become suddenly, overnight, smarter. But he had the confidence to think he was going to be smarter, and so that was the big change in him.__EOS__ Do you sense, when you were speaking to the company of writers, that they ever feel anything - despite their success - resembling pressure to, you know, just do the jokes?",0
51032," I don't care. It's all right. It's all right. Whatever's, you know, everyone, we're not making a big deal out of it. I don't want to be like harping on about we're so angry at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. If we don't care, then we don't care. You know what I mean? I shouldn't even be talking to you right now telling you that we don't care, because it's kind of contradictory. __EOS__ Hmm. __EOS__ You know what I mean? There's the statement, and that's it, right there. __EOS__ Steve Jones, thank you so much. ",2
51033," And you write that it was great to write and not be that invested.

51035," Oh, what? So they just, what, run around spending your budget without recourse?__EOS__ Seniors do. I know. I don't like it. I'd rather be a dictator but no one would work for me.__EOS__ One of my officers was murdered. Don't piss me about. Now Della Smith warned Stuart Brown that the patient he was guarding was a potential target for reprisals. Now where did she get the authority to present that theory?__EOS__ I could've. My mother could've given you that from the TV reports. A gunman tries to kill a witness but not quite. It stands to reason the motive for shooting the guy's still valid.",1
51036," Oh. __EOS__ Michel... __EOS__ But do you... __EOS__ Seeing these experts, these puppeteers and see how they bring those characters to life, I love them all. ",3
51037," We'd take a biopsy and work on it. __EOS__ But now that was the early days. The way we work these days, when we work, I usually have a fix on a lyric, and I'll bring in eight or 10 or 12 lines, and I'll give it to Mike. And he'll go home and work on it because this way, we can have some time alone. __EOS__ Which is a delight. And - or I will write a melody or half a melody and lay it on Jerry and say, listen, what can you do with this? And then we'll get back together and tear it apart and start over. __EOS__ I want to thank you both very much for talking with us. ",2
51038," Mm-hmm.__EOS__ It's probably stretching...__EOS__ Carrying it over to another phrase or another sentence, you mean?__EOS__ Yeah. And also just - especially in, like, on the higher notes, I think you tend to hold certain notes and bend certain notes and change certain notes in a way that is distinctively Barbra Streisand.",1
51039," Yeah, yeah, I do. But in the '60s - and I was a young singer who had too much money, and I started a foundation called the Nihewan Foundation for Native American Education. Because if I had a concert in New York, I'd be out on the reservation  or you know, somewhere in U.S. or Canada. In Australia, you know, I do the concert in Sydney. Then I'd be out in the bush with aboriginal people. It pointed out to me that Native American people wanted to be understood, because Native American people suffer from being misperceived all of our lives, because there's just nothing out there in the mainstream curriculum. So in the '70s, when I finished with ""Sesame Street""… __EOS__ We should explain. You were on ""Sesame Street"" for like five or six years, right? __EOS__ Yeah. Yeah. __EOS__ You will forgive me. You showed Big Bird how to nourish an infant. ",2
51040," Very hectic. __EOS__ It was a very busy life. Very interesting because in the '80s, all these new financial products were very new in Europe. So it was not just, you know, trading money. It was also explaining how these things worked to customers, and so it was also very challenging intellectually. __EOS__ Wait. Wait. Wait. When you say ""these things,"" are you talking about all the things that created the housing bubble? __EOS__ Like the securitization of mortgages and... ",1
51041," I certainly recognize that. I still get the same chill that I felt as a very young child sort of sitting on the floor of our next-door neighbor playing a '78 of the great Marian Anderson singing the ""Alto Rhapsody"" of Brahms. I remember what the living room looked like and where the stereo system was. I guess one called it a phonograph at the time. And listening to that voice for the first time was incredible.__EOS__ .__EOS__ Jessye Norman said that Marian Anderson was something of a beacon in her career. She told the story of how they eventually met and became good friends. Another one of her favorites, one she never got to meet, was Duke Ellington...__EOS__ ...And his great band, including the likes of alto saxophonist Johnny Hodges.",2
51042,"  I'm not saying you have to play...__EOS__  You know, it's not about style, you know, it's - I want my music to go inside the soul of a person. You know, it's - for me its colors. I want people to feel the same way I see it. You know, it's just colors - that's it. And the rest is just painted with a little science fiction here and there. I don't want to freak you out- this early.__EOS__  I've got to get you over to London.__EOS__  That's a clip from ""Jimi  All Is By My Side."" John Ridley, Andre Benjamin welcome to FRESH AIR.

51044," If you hear African pop music in the U.S., you can in part thank King Sunny Ade. Back in the 1980s, the Nigerian musician toured across the country, bringing his traditional vocals and percussion, blended with electric guitars and keyboards, a type of music called juju. __EOS__ . __EOS__ King Sunny Ade was back on U.S. stages this summer, and our music reviewer Banning Eyre, the editor of afropop.org, met up with him as he recorded a new CD in a studio outside Philadelphia. __EOS__ It's been nearly a decade since King Sunny Ade released new music outside Nigeria. His touring band is a little smaller and younger, but based on what I heard in the studio, the music hasn't changed. ",2

I think he's a great actor, obviously, and...__EOS__ No, and I probably never will because my impression is - and you can tell me that I'm wrong. My impression is that he doesn't enjoy being interviewed, and also that he's not - he never strikes me, on those rare occasions when I see him interviewed, as somebody who's a particularly verbal person, at least not in an interview situation.__EOS__ It's interesting. And then you see that man, you know, on a houseboat in what looks like a sort of tsunami-like situation going on a dissertation, almost biblical, in ""Cape Fear."" And you think, wow. That's the same guy? You know, it's - as Max Cady.

51047," The civil rights movement was something that evolved along with me. I didn't enter the civil rights movement formally until the '60s, actually. So those 20 years between the time of the Second World War and the civil rights movement of the '60s was something - was a period of great confusion for people like me. It was formalized during the '60s when we actually had devices. We had systems with which to become involved with that civil rights union.__EOS__ What do you mean by a period of great confusion for you?__EOS__ Because I grew up in California. I grew up from the age of 6 through my - through the time and I became a union clerk in that hall - union hall at 20. So that I pretty much grew up as the second-generation Californian. Not having grown up under racial segregation - under a system that was formally racial segregation - though, of course, racial prejudice existed, it was by gentlemen's agreement. It was not encoded into the laws, as it was in the South. So that I was spared that kind of experience growing up. And was introduced to it formally only after the black migration into the defense zones, under Roosevelt's arsenal of democracy.__EOS__ Well, explain to be then what brought you to the civil rights movement. For a person - I mean, this confusion eventually led to you deciding to get involved. What was it? Was it then participating in a segregated union? Or was it something that you saw in your personal life?",3
51048,"  It works. Oh, this is amazing.__EOS__ But Tadashi dies in an accident. For the rest of the move, Baymax is the steady, reliable caregiver for Tadashi's younger brother, Hiro.__EOS__  It is all right to cry.__EOS__  No. No, no, no, no.",1
51049," Thank you very much, I'm thrilled to be here.__EOS__ So let's start with a reading from ""What Happened to Sophie Wilder,"" and this is from the middle of the book, and it has to do with religion. Would you introduce the reading for us?__EOS__ Sure, the speaker in this passage is a young writer named Charlie Blakeman, and he is talking about the title character, Sophie Wilder, who was his love in college and he fell out with, and she subsequently converted to Catholicism, which is a decision that he's trying to make some sense of.__EOS__ Thank you for reading that. Why did you want to write about the inability to imagine someone you know turning to God in their time of need? Why did you want that to be a central part of the novel?",0
51050," He did. My father, he was the kind of guy that, you know, he's always, throw out any subject, and I got a joke on it. And he really - one of the high points of his life was my mom is a Ph.D. in psychology, and she went to one of her psychology conventions, and the scheduled entertainment for that night had cancelled. And the psychologists, knowing that my father was a big joke-teller, asked if he would mind stepping in and telling some jokes. __EOS__ Now the essay that was the biggest surprise to me in your book is the one in which you explain that although you'd been married, although you'd always liked boys, you wanted to have a lesbian fling. And the woman you had that fling with more than 12 years ago has become your partner. You've since adopted a son. You have seven rescue dogs together. __EOS__ I don't know what came over me, Terry. It just became this obsession. I just remember I really wanted to have an affair with a woman. I remember this movie ""Bound"" was out at the time. __EOS__ Oh, Gina Gershon, is that the...? ",0
51051," Well, the, I mean the responses were basically across the spectrum, as you might imagine. Some were unrepentant. I got in touch with a man who had confessed to carrying out acts of torture on enemy prisoners and civilian detainees, and he told me that if he was faced with a Vietnam type situation again he would do the exact same thing. He was proud of his service. There were other people, you know, who had very, very different response. One veteran who sticks out in my mind, I remember talking to him, he's very jovial, had an infectious laugh and he got, kind of, quiet as we were talking, and he told me about going into a village one time and he told me about a member of his unit.__EOS__ There were a lot of American reporters in Vietnam when the American military was there. Did they miss this story?__EOS__ Well, if you do read the press reports at the time, there are a lot of reporters, a lot of them foreign - or I should say, not American reporters there, who talked about the carnage in some detail. But American reporters, you know, were I think less apt talk about this darker side of the war and it wasn't popular among editors stateside. I think there was a fair amount of self-censorship going on. There were reporters who say that, you know, if they came in with a story that said like, you know, my god civilians are being killed in the countryside, they wouldn't be taken seriously. I think that one of the most telling aspects of the war is the fact that the one atrocity, the one massacre that people know about, My Lai, was committed when there were hundreds, maybe 500 American reporters in the country at the time. But it took a stateside reporter, Seymour Hersh, to eventually blow the lid off My Lai. When My Lai was reported, just afterwards, it was a major U.S. victory, 128 enemy killed at the cost of no American lives. And no one thought to look into this extremely lopsided body count and ask why no weapons were recovered, why fighting this hardcore enemy force no Americans were killed. It was just reported as another American victory.__EOS__ And remind us how many civilians were killed at My Lai?",0

51053," I think the weight of history has already been shouldered by Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters and all the recording music that was back during the time that was the real thing. You know, it's hard for this time period to make that kind of guy, you know. But I don't think that this day and age can make a Sonny Boy Williamson because of where we are in society right now. __EOS__ Keb Mo visited our studios this week to talk about his eighth album. It's called Suitcase. __EOS__  I've got a suitcase. I take it everywhere I go. I got a suitcase, baby. I take it everywhere I go. It's just a big old bag of trouble. Trouble's all I know. __EOS__ It's about life. It's like you're dragging this bunch of experiences around that are some time, if you let them, they're controlling you now. You know, you're letting your past, you know, that someone at school that hurt you and said something, you can't let it go. It's still governing your choices. ",2
51054," Yes. __EOS__ This $700 billion pool that the government put together to address this problem with the banks, and the president said in his speech on Wall Street, you know, they're beginning to pay this money back with interest. We're making money. If that's okay, I mean why hasn't that cured the problem of troubled assets? __EOS__ Well, because obviously if they're paying back the money that the government gave them they're not using it to shore-up their capital. They're not using it to shore up their balance sheet. I think that a lot of banks are in a hurry to pay back these monies that the government extended to them to sort of show that things are okay. It almost sort of feels to me like a sort of flexing of the muscle of yes, we survived. We are out of our hole. We're finally digging out. We can pay the government back and, you know, kind of hope that that'll get us over the, you know, rest of the bumpy periods here. But, you know, I don't think that just paying back the government is any indication that we are out of the woods. __EOS__ We've been hearing about a lot of bank failures. I mean not the big mega-banks but just smaller banks, 91, I think, this year. What does that tell us? ",3
51055," Mm-hmm. __EOS__ Make no mistake about it - being crazy is painful. And being crazy is hell, whether you get it from taking a drug or whether it happens because youre just trying to lead the American way of life and it keeps kicking your legs out from under you. One way or another, it's hell on you. And it's nothing that's fun about it, and I am certainly not recommending it. It is a lens through which I looked at stuff, but its hard on the eyes. But I think I had a very valid viewpoint, and much closer than a lot of the doctors were having. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ It gave me an empathy that I could never have come up with. A better example is, those first three pages of Cuckoos Nest were written on peyote. And I dont know any Indians; I dont know where that Indian came from. Ive always felt humbled by that character. Without the character of that Indian, the book is melodrama. You know, its a straight battle between McMurphy and the big nurse. With that Indian's consciousness to filter that through, that makes it exceptional. ",0
51056,"  You don't know how to drink, your whole generation. You drink for the wrong reasons. My generation, we drink because it's good, because it feels better than unbuttoning your collar, because we deserve it. We drink because it's what men do.__EOS__ Is there something really delicious about slipping into that role and just knowing the things that Roger will do that you get to do as an actor?__EOS__ It really is. I mean, to be that facile, to be able to turn a phrase like that in the moment and have the courage to say what you and maybe everyone else in the room is thinking, it's been very enjoyable.__EOS__ Do you think it's going to be a hard character for you to shake when the show is over or is it in some way maybe a relief to think, Roger Sterling is behind me now, I'm moving on?",1
51057," How were you questioned when you were interrogated? __EOS__ It varied from place to place, and I think Guantanamo was certainly not the worst of it. The worst of it was in Kandahar and Bagram. And I think that that certainly constitutes not only psychological and physical torture, but also cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment, which included being hog-tied, being shackled to the ground, being kicked and punched and beaten, having my clothes ripped off with a knife, having the sounds of a woman screaming, which I was led to believe was my wife, and being threatened with even further torture by being sent, tentatively, to Egypt, to be raped and electrocuted, were the types of threats that I was facing. __EOS__ The woman screaming - what did they do? __EOS__ Well, of course at this point, this was in Bagram. Um, I had had no contact... ",0

Acting funny, but I don't know why.  Excuse      me, while I kiss the sky. __EOS__  In London, Hendrix formed his first trio, the Jimi Hendrix      Experience.  Thirty-nine years ago today, that band played its first show      as a headliner.  It was Munich.  The show was alive with all the electric      energy, guitar-smashing and powerful rock that's made Hendrix shows true      experiences. Charles Cross is author of ""Roomful of Mirrors   A Biography      of Jimi Hendrix."" In that book, he describes the founding of the Jimi      Hendrix Experience. __EOS__  Thank you. ",2
51059," Oscar nominations are out this week. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ Two African-Americans are nominated for Best Actor, two for Best Supporting Actor, one African-American woman for Best Supporting Actress. Do you think that this means that there's finally a level playing field for African-Americans in Hollywood, or is it still feast or famine? __EOS__ This means that we're winning more awards. That's what this means. It does not mean that - I mean when you, you go and ask the average African-American actor, you know, in Hollywood, they would tell you they don't work. I think what this does show is that better material is getting through. I think 10 years ago, you would've seen a ""Hotel Rwanda"" or ""Blood Diamond"" or any of those kinds of films being made.

51065," Yeah, I can't deal with what didn't happen long ago. I can only deal with the situation we have today and we're working very hard to address all of these issues we've put forward. I think some strong recommendations the President's Working Group on Financial Markets we have all the top regulators in the U.S. that come together with one voice that's very powerful. They have strong powers to the extent they need additional authority. They'll ask for it so we're going to deal with these problems but we need to do it in a balanced way because we don't want to hurt those consumers who are going to continue to need credit and are going to continue to benefit from our capital markets. __EOS__ You mentioned additional authority, do anticipate that there might be more specific regulations down the road, things maybe that would require stronger laws, for example? __EOS__ Well, first of all, there are plenty of things being done like, for instance, right now, the Fed has promulgated some new rules that will have to do with unfair and deceptive lending practices, have to do with disclosures. We're going to need a stronger licensing standards and standards to be enforced at the state level for monitoring brokers and insuring appropriate behavior and that kind of thing. So there's going to be some instances where we need more regulation, some instances where we may need legislation. There's a big focus also on the rating agencies and over-reliance that rating. __EOS__ Sec.

51067," Yes. At the beginning, I didn't understand why they were reacting to me with such an aggressive, you know, attitude. But my fellow hostages, like me, we were in a very deprived situation where everything was being denied from us. And the only thing we could cling to was our name to just prove our existence. __EOS__ I can't imagine what it would be like to be a prisoner for a week, let alone six years. How did you just get through the day? I mean, at a certain point, you must have thought, I'm going to be here forever. __EOS__ Yeah, I thought that. The relationship with time changes when you're captive. In the free world, your days pass very quickly because you have so many things to do and you're in control of your life. In our case, when we were abducted, it was exactly the opposite. The days were eternal. We didn't know how to fill those days with things because we were always into two extremes; boredom and the anxiety of what could happen. __EOS__ You write about at times you had a Harry Potter book between you and then at one time you had a dictionary that you carried with you.

51069," It's fairly fortuitous that that should be the case that this book, which is set in 1960, should in some ways mimic, at least in terms of what happens to the Parsons family, the lives and situations of a lot of Americans and a lot of Europeans and a lot of people all over the world in which they are threatened with the loss of their house, the loss of an income, the loss of a sense of being able to anticipate a hopeful future...__EOS__ Yeah, in this Western expanse. And, in fact, what little I know about bank robberies is they're not so uncommon, as we might think.__EOS__ Well, they're not uncommon in the West, anyway, because there is a thought of deceptive quality to the West, which is to say that if I can do this and just get out of town, I'll be OK.

There's quite a range; it takes real understanding of who's who, and it takes some deftness to apply. But I would say the very first thing that the United States government needs to do is improve its intelligence and information gathering around this problem. The United States government has a tendency to assume that its counterpart government is functioning as a government. And so what U.S. officials tend to know about are the official functions of different, you know, government officials in a foreign country. U.S. officials have not done a systematic analysis in countries like Uzbekistan or Nigeria or Cameroon or - or Bulgaria of how this government is actually functioning as a very effective criminal organization.__EOS__ So they have a flow chart that says what everyone should be doing...__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ ...But they don't have an accurate picture of what everyone's actually up to.",0

It's a very important and seminal book in the women's rights movement. It deserves the attention that it's gotten. It deserves the accolades. It is disappointing that it doesn't include more things that would resonate with working class women and black women, but it's one of those things you have to - it's of its time in that case where people just didn't consider those points of views. I mean Betty Friedan was writing from her own reality and that just happens sometimes. Like, I'm not going to read Sojourner Truth and wonder why she didn't write more about rich white women.

His book is called ""Lawrence in Arabia  War, Deceit, Imperial Folly And The Making Of The Modern Middle East.""__EOS__ Yeah, he didn't, in a word. He was openly contemptuous of the whole regimentation and the climate of puffery. And it wasn't just the British army. I think it was all armies at that time. I think he felt he knew the region better than almost everybody else and just saw how wrongheaded approaches were. And the military hierarchy also didn't like him. He was upbraided a number of times for - his uniform was always a mess. He would forget to salute. He would forget his belt. And it was a pretty antagonistic relationship in both directions.__EOS__ And he actually wasn't ever trained as a soldier, right?__EOS__ No. He had never had a single day of military training. And there's a great story of that, of how he became a military officer. Before he came out to Cairo for the British military intelligence, he was working for the mapping room of the British military headquarters in London. And the mapping office, so many men had gone to the Western Front in France and Belgium, that it basically consisted of Lawrence and one other man. And a general who was about to go off to fight in France came to the mapping room to see the maps of the front, the battle front that he was going to be going to. And he was so incensed at being briefed by a civilian, Lawrence, that he demanded - that he demanded that he be briefed by an officer.

They didn't have any rights. And Anthony, of course, turns her - the primary effort for the rest of her very long life towards suffrage. But as late as the late 1890s, she is appealing to the leaders of the Prohibition movement to make it clear that they should be supporting the suffrage movement because women will vote for Prohibition. And in fact, the only other political movement that the Anti-Saloon League, which was the primary organizing group behind the Prohibition amendment, the only other political movement they supported was the women's suffrage movement. __EOS__ Because they knew that a lot of women would vote for Prohibition. __EOS__ They knew that women would vote for Prohibition, and in fact they did. The biggest opponents of the women's suffrage movement in the first two decades of the century were the brewers. The brewers financed anti-suffrage campaigns in many, many states because they, too, feared that vote. ",3
51085," Were the scripts and the storylines at all like your high-school experiences growing up in Palo Alto? __EOS__ Yeah, to a certain extent. I got in a lot of trouble. I mean, it was silly trouble, I guess as much trouble as you get in in Palo Alto. __EOS__ For what? __EOS__ I got arrested for graffiti. I got arrested - a lot of, like, underage drinking, drunk in public, shoplifting, you know, your various, like, suburban arrests, I guess. ",3
51086," Yeah?__EOS__ Yeah, yeah.__EOS__ Were you singing words?__EOS__ Well, no, I wasn't. I was just going, you know, ooh, and just using my falsetto voice to sort of - to sing. And also earlier in ""Dance of Lilies,"" during the storm, I actually sing with a full chest voice, as they say, and sort of belt out some ahs over the whole thing. Early on, I know J.C. said he wanted to hear my voice. I wasn't so sure about that. But I was able to find some places where it made sense.",2
51087," You taste all of these things, this sort of onion-lemon thing, and then you taste a tomato-chili thing, and they were all things that were sort of not quite what I knew but very familiar. __EOS__ Harris has spent years tracing those flavors from Africa all the way across the Atlantic, where they became the building blocks of American cooking, cooking traditions that were imported to the new world primarily by enslaved Africans. __EOS__ A Culinary Journey from Africa to America."" And I asked her to meet me in the kitchen, where we made Brazilian style collard greens, a new twist on a classic African-American dish. And the first thing she told me came as a surprise. __EOS__ Collard greens are actually not African. They're not an African ingredient at all. They're a northern European green. Collard is a corruption of colewort. Colewort is any non-heading cabbage. The Africanism, if you will, in them is the Southern traditional way of cooking them, which we don't have time for, unfortunately  long, low and slow. ",0

Today, he's at YouTube full time. And each year, the vast majority of new graduate hires at Google come directly from the internship program.

51090," For the umpteenth time, Art, how did ""Maus"" come about?__EOS__ Ha. By accident, as almost everything I end up getting obsessed with happens. I'd been invited into an underground comic called ""Funny Aminals,"" and after a couple of really bum starts - and then actually sitting in on Ken Jacobs's film classes one day, while this was churning around in my head - he showed some very old Mickey Mouse cartoons, when Mickey was still kind of jazzy, and he said, look at this guy. He's actually Al Jolson with big round ears. And then all of a sudden, this kind of epiphany of, that's it - I'll do a strip about race in America with black mice and Ku Klux Kats or something, and it took me 24 hours to realize I knew bupkis about being black in America.__EOS__ And, at some level, obviously, in many ways reflects your family history. How painful was it for you to live with that for 13 years?__EOS__ You know, it was painful but I think everything one does it to avoid something more painful, and so this was less painful than not doing it, ultimately.",0

51093," Now, I was going to ask you how Disney has dealt not with the specific examples where they actually went in and changed the films digitally but overall how they dealt with these complaints? __EOS__ Well, I think one of the way that they dealt with it is sort of by case by case trying to do something as an amends. In the case of ""Princess and the Frog,"" they're giving us their first African-American princess. In the case of ""Aladdin,"" they were giving us the first Arabian princess. In the case of ""Pocahontas,"" they were giving us the first Native American princess. In ""Mulan,"" we had the Chinese princess. __EOS__ As we talk about ""The Princess and the Frog,"" is it possible that we are debating issues that just don't carry the same weight with the target audience for this film? __EOS__ Well, I think that that's true to a certain extent. I mean I think a lot of people can go see this film and they'll probably enjoy it and their kids will enjoy it and they won't really think twice about it. But I think that, you know, it's the role of criticism to talk about how films function in a broader cultural context. So, you know, I may have my own objections about the movie, the music, the acting these kind of criteria. But what we're talking about here is something that goes beyond, I think, the artistic merits of the film. ",1

51096," Before the stroke you did research at Harvard. And one of the things you were very active in, I think you are still active in, this is trying to convince people to donate their brains after their death to the Harvard Brain Bank because you need brain tissue to continue the kind of research that's being done at Harvard. So you did a lot of lecture tours before your stroke, convincing people to donate their brains and you became known as the singing scientist in part because you wrote this little tissue bank jingle and with singers on your tours. __EOS__ I do still sing. It was actually quite the gift, because before the stroke, I really could not sing in tune. And oddly, after the stroke I managed to actually be able to sing in tune. But I do still sing for brains and because there is this shortage of tissue available for us to better understand, at a biological level, what is going on in the brains of individuals who would have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective or bipolar or anxiety or OCD, what is different at the cellular level. __EOS__ Those of us who were close to someone who had a stroke have so many questions about what goes on. And I think most people who have had strokes, can't summon up the memories of it nearly as well as you can. A lot of people don't remember what happened at all, or remember very little. What are some of the questions people who've had strokes, or people who've had close friends or family who've suffered strokes - what are some of the questions that they ask you to try to explain what happened or what the experience was like, what lay behind the most confusing behavior? __EOS__ You know, I think that everyone who has a stroke has, of course, their own unique experience. But to be able to give language to the experience has been what many people have said to me. Another thing is, you know, I think it's really important that those of us with left hemispheres, who would project drama and trauma onto the experience of stroke, we would project our own fears onto the experience that this person is having and that person may not be having as terrible a time as we are projecting onto them. ",0
51097," Yeah, well, this is actually reflective not only of the media, but also, you know, it's reflective on all of us as a society and how we do in fact move toward stories which are sensational. And when you watch it unfolding, it's - the bizarreness of it really gets to you and it's very funny as you watch it. But the sad fact is that it's actually not really far from the truth. __EOS__ The film's Director, Anusha Rizvi, wanted to use music that would be decidedly different from songs that Bollywood fans are used too. The subject of this song scarcely calls to mind romantic images. It's about inflation. __EOS__ It wasnt in the film when the script was written. It was when she was actually in Budwal, the village that she was shooting in. She heard the local, you know, band of musicians one night singing the song. So this is a song that they had written for themselves, all the villagers, and they were singing it. And she really loved it. __EOS__ And who were having the experience, presumably. ",1
51098," Well, you know, you mentioned ""Taxi Driver,"" and you know, ""Taxi Driver,"" that movie can almost be watched in a loop because the very last image is of the empty rear-view mirror, which is also the very first image. We've just come full-circle, that this guy is going to ride around in this cab until the rage builds up, and he's going to explode again. And it's just going to happen in this endless cycle. __EOS__ Oh my God, I didn't even realize that. It was my... __EOS__ ...must've been my subconscious. __EOS__ Yeah, I figured that wasn't intentional, but... ",1
51099," Yeah. __EOS__ But he also stood up for the discipline of music and learning it. And as you pointed out, the music had to be tight as well as their sort of performance. Let's hear short clip. __EOS__ Do you think that kids do understand the importance of the discipline, that people, communities understand the importance of the discipline that you learn from music and all that it brings? __EOS__ Yeah. I mean the first thing that I learned was that it actually helps a kid learn how to read faster, because once you're learning how to read notes you start developing that muscle of recognition and execution. You never know what a kid may pick up. Now not every kid is going to go away and be, you know, Miles Davis or be a Chopin or Mozart, but it gives them something to work towards and it gives them, you know, inspiration... ",1

51102," Well, I want to play another track from your new CD, ""Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!,"" and this one also has a Jesus reference to it. It's called ""Jesus of the Moon."" It's a beautiful song. I mean it's a love song. Would you talk a little bit about writing this song? __EOS__ Well, you know, I mean I think that this particular record, ""Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!,"" despite the title is it's probably the least obsessed or religiously obsessed record I've made in years. It's really not about that. And there is a song called ""Jesus of the Moon,"" really, but I just felt it was a kind of nifty way of describing a sleeping woman and a sleeping woman that I was kind of departing from. It just felt good to describe her in that way. __EOS__ Oh, I think it's a great song. Let's hear it. This is ""Jesus of the Moon"" from Nick Cave's new CD, which is called ""Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!"" __EOS__  I stepped out of the St. James Hotel, I'd left you behind curled up like a child. A change is gonna come, and as the door whispered shut I walked on down the high-windowed hall. You lay sleeping on the unmade bed, the weatherman on the television in the St. James Hotel said that the rains are gonna come. And I stepped out on the street all sparkling clean with the early morning dew. Maybe it was you or maybe it was me?  You came on like a punch in the heart. You're lying there with the light on your hair like a Jesus of the moon. A Jesus of the planets and the stars. ",2
51103," And... __EOS__ It's got some good fish-out-of-water elements, always a crowd pleaser. __EOS__ Absolutely, and it's just really funny, and original, and different, very different from the other books that we've read. __EOS__ Would you care to read us a passage? ",0
51104," Absolutely not. In fact, it's quite the other way around. The other dynamic that I was mentioning at the outset was the change within the Cuban vote itself, what used to be a monolithically Republican Cuban vote is now splitting Cuban immigrants that have arrived since 1990 and Cuban-Americans, the sons, daughters and grandsons and granddaughters of the older wave of Cuban exiles that came in the '50s and '60s and '70s, who are entering the electorate themselves are not registering as monolithically Republican as their grandparents and parents. __EOS__ So can you give us a sense of how the Hispanic vote in all its various forms and complexity now is breaking, within the Republican primary and potentially for the Democratic nominee Kendrick Meek. __EOS__ Well, if you look at the recent polling, amongst Hispanics, it's really a vote that's up for grabs. Neither Charlie Crist, Kendrick Meek or Marco Rubio, the likely candidates, have been able to really mount a significant share of that vote overall. __EOS__ And finally, what issues are Latino voters pushing to the forefront? Or are they divided on these issues as well? ",3

So... __EOS__  Yeah. __EOS__  Yeah, that's a fair question and people often raise it.      There are two answers to that question.  One is that all the important      innovations underlying European society were not made in Europe itself,      but were made further south, especially in the Fertile Crescent and      what's now Turkey. That's where agriculture developed, where metal tools,      where writing, where empires developed.  All of those things were      imported into Europe and Europe didn't start making its own contributions      until about a thousand years ago with the development of windmills and      water powered technology.

51108," I like a baseball cap. But when you think back historically, people wore around the world a lot more fantastical headgear than many people wear today. I sometimes wonder why.__EOS__ You know, hats have changed meaning. At one time, hats were a conformist accessory when you conformed, and now, they're an accessory of rebellion. So that's why young people are attracted to the quirkiness of a hat because they like to be interested in something or wear something that their parents aren't interested in. I mean, if you look on TV, you know, all those kids on MTV, they've got, you know, hats with some description on, or ethnic communities in America, they wear hats.

51109," And we need - it may sound rather shallow but it's not - those have to be embraced, they can't be denied, and that's what happens to Emma. I don't want to give away the arc, but let me just say that by the end she couldn't be more different than when we meet her at the beginning. __EOS__ Well, this is the story we wanted to tell. I was talking to somebody the other day who was pointing out his opinion that, you know, how tragic it is that Emma starts off so beautiful, you know, with a lot of mascara on, long hair, and by the end of the film she's, you know, such a mess. And I was very intrigued by this, because so many of my friends believe that, you know, at the beginning of the film Emma is a doll, and by the end she actually feels real. You know, it's such a relief that she's washed her face at last. __EOS__ Tilda Swinton, do you think of this as an Italian film, or is it a European film, or - how would you characterize ""I Am Love""? __EOS__ I think both Luca and I would really like to think of it as an intergalactic film. I mean, we like - we've been very gratified by the fact that very little has been made in these Anglophone places or the fact that it's in Italian at all. I mean, it is, in a way, Jacki, a fairy story. You know, it's not a documentary and it's not some social study really. It, of course, occupies a semi-realistic space and it does talk about a kind of milieu that really does exist or really did exist. But it's really something other. It's supposed to be able to touch people from everywhere. ",1
51110," Well, I thought it was a great opportunity to give back to an organization that really changed my life. I have spent my entire career as a lawyer in public service, and when I got that opportunity, actually, to go to a local Girl Scout Council based in San Antonio, Texas, I felt that was a wonderful opportunity to help create that next generation of leaders.__EOS__ You know, why is it that membership in the Girl Scouts is still disproportionately and overwhelmingly white? It's nearly 80 percent. And at the same time that, you know, all of the surveys show, including surveys by the Girl Scouts, show that African-American and Latina girls actually aspire to leadership, at least they say they do, even more than Caucasian girls do. Why do you think that is?__EOS__ Well, first of all, I just wanted to share with your listeners that we've actually been a very inclusive and diverse organization for close to 100 years. Actually, we were just in Houston at our national convention and I pointed out to members there that we had our first Latina troop organized, actually, in Houston in 1922. We did have desegregated troops of girls long before, you know, a law was passed instructing us to do so. So it's always been part of our mission, part of our vision.__EOS__ One more challenge I did want to talk to you about, and this is something that I think people tend to associate with the Boy Scouts more than with the Girl Scouts, and that's the whole question of how to address questions of sexuality. I'm sure you remember the story out of a troop in Denver where a seven year old was rejected by a Denver Girl Scout Troop because he has, quote, unquote, ""boy parts,"" even though he identifies as a girl who prefers to dress as a girl and really sees himself as a girl. And the Girl Scout Council of Colorado actually reversed that decision and changed – and said that the child is welcome.",3

I just wanted to make one comment. I'm an engineer by profession, but I've been writing for a long time because my parents have. And I write in my native language from Kanada which is a very, very big language in south India. I've been in the United States for almost 13 years now and have published poetry as well as short stories for several years. __EOS__ And do you think if you wrote in English, it might be different? __EOS__ No. I actually am trying to write something different in English. But when I actually try to write in English, it just goes back to my stories from India of my teenage years and my childhood years. It's all different stories, but it's all from my past. So it's kind, you know, it's ingrained and it's really hard to change that. ",0

How has that changed you, Kenny Garrett, as a person? __EOS__ Well, I think the things that, you know, because China has such rich history, I was, you know, the philosophy was similar to my philosophy. And I was thinking, wow, I have to get to China to see that. And once I got to China, I realized that people are really all the same. You know, when I travel to Japan and to Africa and to India and to, you know, to China, I found that people - after you get beyond the language barrier or the culture barrier -everybody wants the same thing  to be loved and have stability in their life. __EOS__ Are you wearing Eastern-style clothing now?

Why is that?__EOS__ Well, the climbers collectively experienced very dry and windy conditions this year, and so there wasn't a lot of snow on the mountain - which when there's more snow, loose rocks are frozen in place, the snow hasn't turned into blue ice, which it did this year. And blue ice is very laborious to climb and requires extra protection. And should you slip you cannot stop as you would in a normal snow year where you would sort of be caught by the snow.__EOS__ Six deaths on Everest in a period of five days. I'm wondering, we've heard a lot about traffic being a problem this year. Can you explain why a lot of people on the mountain at once, on the same days, can create a problem?",3
51118," Oh, I certainly was close to going to Ole Miss. My older brother Cooper was at school there. That's where my dad really - and the majority of my family went to school there. But, yeah, I think choosing a college is definitely one of the hardest decisions that any kid has to make, and, you know, the hardest thing for me was that you had to pick one school. __EOS__ Archie Manning, I'm thinking that the Mississippi Alumni Association would probably have been much happier with you if had been a little more aggressive. __EOS__ Well, probably so. A few people were upset, but I think Peyton was doing his due diligence. He knew what he was looking for. He knew what he wanted. It was the best place for him, just like 40-something years ago Ole Miss was the right place for me. Ole Miss was the right place for Eli.

And he's shaking it. Shake it, Frank. Frank, Frank you got the - Frank, you got to open, the cap is on, Frank. You got to open the bottle before it will goddamn pour out. And then she goes on a rant. He's so stupid it's pathetic. He'll never invent the airplane. He'll never invent the light bulb. He's lucky if he knows how to turn one on.__EOS__ He'll never invent the airplane.",3
51126," How would you want people to remember David Halberstam? __EOS__ I think that David should be remembered, first of all, as an absolutely extraordinary journalist who was unafraid to tell the truth as he saw it under any circumstances whatsoever. But also, he was a man of good company and great friendship. He could be as lovely as he could be tough. And that's a great thing to say about any man, I think. __EOS__ Frank Deford, thanks for speaking with us. __EOS__ It's been a delight to talk about David Halberstam.

51127," You know, what you just said is exactly, exactly the point of this album. It felt like Motown. It felt like Marvin Gaye. But it's still got 808s in it. It's still upbeat. So it still works for today. And he definitely came on and sounded like Marvin Gaye, which I think is a great thing because it's great to pay tribute to those who came before us.__EOS__ People feel like nowadays hip-hop is so empty, the hip-hop they hear on the radio, that when they hear someone have a little bit of substance or content, they're drawn to it. And even though I've worked with some of the best producers in the business, you know, people still don't understand that musical choices have a lot to do with where I go musically.__EOS__ Now, let's talk a little bit about the title of the album because a few years ago you actually told NPR that you try and stay away from using the word conscious in titles?__EOS__ Yes, I think I remember that.",2
51128," Oh, hi there. I'm actually a teacher, a high school teacher, and I teach a British literature course. And I thought this was interesting that this was on, because actually this week, we're doing an Anglo-Saxon history. And I wanted to ask Mr. Cornwell if there were any - I actually teach kind of a lower-level student, and getting them to remain interested in some of the stuff is a little bit tough. So I was wondering if there was any particular research or stories or resources that would be good for these - for this kind of thing. __EOS__ Oh, well, obviously, I'm going to tell you to make them read ""The Last Kingdom,"" which is the very first book in the series, and then there can be another four for them. I - you know, I think, it's an exciting period. And I think those kids would find it exciting. It's about Vikings. __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ You know, it's about these hairy warriors coming ashore and beating the hell out of everybody, and how the Saxons fight back. I mean, there's a lot there that is - the curious thing about all this is that the English themselves don't know this history. I mean, for some strange reason, when you - if you grow up in England, as I did, history begins at 1066. And everything that happened before that is sort of shrouded in fog and mystery. ",0
51129," That you're the mother. And I wanted to ask, does that ever happen to you, that people are sometimes confused about the fact that you're the mother of African-American sons… __EOS__ Sure. Sure. __EOS__ …and how do you handle that? __EOS__ Well, I just laugh at it. I don't really pay that much attention, to tell you the truth. ",3
51130," In the mid-1970s, one of the songs Dana Owens, or Queen Latifah, heard over and over again was ""Poetry Man"" by Phoebe Snow. __EOS__ My mom played ""Poetry Man"" a lot when I was a kid in the house. She - I mean, she played that album endlessly. __EOS__ I cleaned my house many a Saturday listening to ""Poetry Man."" __EOS__ Rita Owens, a retired high school art teacher, is Queen Latifah's mom. ",2
51131," Absolutely. She is always standing tall when she's dealing with Hilly because she emotionally wants Hilly to know that, you know what, you're not superior to me. But when she's with Celia, I think it's just that she's relaxed and when she's with her children, when she sends her daughter off to work for that first time, that, if anything, crushes her and you definitely see the shift in her posture because now what she has dreaded more than anything - her daughter following in her footsteps - is happening. __EOS__ And she's telling her daughter the do's and don'ts and her daughter, too, is wearing the uniform. __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ For Minny, the life that she's consigned to is like a girdle that's a few sizes too small. She can't wait to break out of it, but until then, it's just sort of cutting her up. What did you have to do to get in that frame of mind? And was it a bit disorienting to go in and out of that as you're filming during the day and then you're back in 2011, 2010 at the end of the day? ",1
51132," When he was running for office last year, he said he'd do the public good, and when he was elected, he kept his word. He did them good.__EOS__ So that was Bob Hope recorded in 1938, one of his very first radio broadcasts in his series of radio shows. My guest Richard Zoglin is the author of a new biography of Bob Hope called ""Hope."" So, you know, listening to that - listening to Bob Hope's early stand-up, you know, on the one hand, I really appreciate what you're saying as him kind of inventing a certain type of topical standup comedy. Some of the jokes sound kind of funny, some of them just sound really dated or just kind of, like, not that good .__EOS__ Yeah. Well, there's still a lot of vaudeville in that routine. That's fairly early on. All the invented stuff about his uncle - he didn't have an uncle who ran for office. He probably wouldn't have done that kind of joke 10 years later. But the whole idea of at least jumping off of the election - imagine Jack Benny or Bergen and McCarthy talking about the election. They just wouldn't do it. Bob was the only one doing that on radio at that time.__EOS__ And you said, like, he didn't have a comic persona like some of the other radio performers of the era. At what point did he start to create his persona?",0
51133," Oh, I see. Prison tats, yeah, yeah. You must have a lot of responsibility now with a career. __EOS__ I mean, I have to get to the venue and get to the hotel and, you know, play shows. And the responsibility that I have is basically just making sure that I, you know, that I do what's best for me. __EOS__ Do you sometimes envision yourself as being really happy? __EOS__ I am. I mean, I'm happy. I have a house and a cat and a dog and my parents love me. ",2
51134," That's...__EOS__ That was...__EOS__ That's weird, right? I mean, there were actual prisoners in prison where you were shooting?__EOS__ Yes. Yeah, so it's not like shooting on the street where people come up and go hey, what are you guys filming? Like, you don't get - there's not, you know, you don't have prisoners coming up like hey, is this a commercial? It looks awesome. Who's in it? Am I in it? Am I in solitary, what did I do? Did I kill somebody? What - what's going on? Do you need extras? You don't get any of that. They're more just looking at you like, really? You're shooting a film here about prison? Great, that's great.",1
51135," If you're just joining us, we're speaking with veteran reporters Kevin Cullen and Shelley Murphy. They've collaborated on a new biography of Whitey Bulger. It's caleld ""Whitey Bulger  America's Most Wanted Gangster and the Manhunt that Brought Him to Justice.""__EOS__ Well, even from the time when he was a young man, before he went to prison for bank robbery, he was a physical fitness buff. He had a gym, you know, that he worked out on before they became popular. He liked to run. He liked to keep in shape. And when he came out of prison and hooked up with his friend Stephen Flemmi, one thing the two of them had in common is that they did not drink.__EOS__ And then there's his remarkable relationships with the women in his life.__EOS__ Yeah, that was - I think Shelley and I both agree that one of the things we really learned by peeling these onions back, is that Whitey had this - it was sort of - like a lot of things in Whitey's life, there's a contradiction, because he was always seeking this domestic bliss, and yet he kept two households.",0
51136," Mr. Zukor said now, this is important. I want you to repeat it every day. Very important. I said yes, Mr. Zukor. He said dress British, but think Yiddish. __EOS__ Lyles took that advice. To this day, he's known for his elegant Savile Row suits and his business savvy. From the late '50s through the '60s, he produced a string of profitable, B-movie Westerns like ""Black Spurs"" and ""Johnny Reno."" __EOS__  Crime against an Indian is under government jurisdiction. The trial will be in Kansas City. __EOS__  Well, don't you bother none, marshal. We'll see that he gets to Kansas City. I'll see to it. ",1
51137," So you have a song called ""Outfit"" that was first recorded by the Drive-By Truckers when you were with them. And the bridge is a device that your father used to give you. Would you just sing the bridge for us with the advice?__EOS__ OK. Yeah.__EOS__  Don't call what you're wearing an outfit. Don't ever say your car is broke. Don't worry about losing your accent, 'cause a southern man tells better jokes.__EOS__ So that's great. So why was he worried that you'd call what you were wearing an outfit?",2
51138,"  Yeah, I saw her first. __EOS__  So you kept it in your mind? __EOS__  Oh, I saw Huff the next day.  But I write stuff down though because I forget it. __EOS__  Now Leon Huff, did you think what this song needs to start with - well, first of all, it starts with horns - like car horns honking in traffic.  And the horns are tuned.  I mean there's a line... ",2
51139," Yay. __EOS__ Yay. And we're… __EOS__ The chair of this year's Caldecott committee was Karen Breen, an editor at Kirkus Reviews. __EOS__ You can't find anybody who didn't think it was a wonderful book. It really came to the issue of whether it was a picture book or not. And that's what this committee decided it was. ",0

51141," On the stage right, the stage is total illusion. You come into a box and you see this proscenia and then people hop on and hop off, theres an orchestra in the pit. But people have imagination. The theater makes you use it and you will accept almost anything. But movies to me are either, the nature of the medium is such that movies are either realistic, by that I mean naturalistic or surrealistic. To me, the movie of ""West Side Story"" I know was a great hit, but when those boys came tour jeteing down the street I didn't believe it for a minute. __EOS__ I still dont. __EOS__ Now you didnt write the screenplay for either ""Gypsy"" or ""West Side Story."" __EOS__ No. ",3
51142," That is the great news.__EOS__ How did it affect your father to have seen his wife so sick? How did it affect him as a doctor?__EOS__ He was profoundly affected in sort of an interesting way. He'd seen patients like her many, many times. I mean he was an ID consultant, so I know he saw cancer patients all the time who had infections and certainly women in their ©40s with breast cancer. But it was one of the earliest times I think he felt that he was powerless at a doctor. Even though he was doing these machinations that we talked about and drawing these blood tests and making decisions, he basically knew that my mother was going to survive. Whether she was going to survive didn't have - there's nothing more he could do at a certain point, that this was basically going to be the disease and the medications and were they shot doing the trick. And so he felt very powerless. And fortunately, it worked out. But in some interesting way that was one of these episodes that stayed with him a long time that there were limits to what medications could do. There were limits to what brilliant doctors could do and some of this was out of his hands. And, you know, to some degree I think that was a good lesson for him because that's a lesson that all doctors have to learn, I think. But it was a particularly moving one for him because this was his wife and this was the - of all cases this is the one he should have been able to do absolutely everything for, but he realized as time went on he could do some things but not others.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Dr. Barron Lerner. He's the author of the new book ""The Good Doctor  A Father, A Son, And the Evolution of Medical Ethics."" Dr. Lerner is a doctor as well as a bioethicist and a professor at NYU School of Medicine. His father was an infectious disease doctor. And the book kind of compares the medical ethics of his generation and his father's generation. And it's based in part on reading his father's journals.",0

51144," So who is the little boy and what happened to him? __EOS__ The exact identity of the little boy, I believe, will never be known. But in fact, I know of at least seven or eight claims to the identity of the little boy, ranging from Australia to Israel to Poland to France to England, and one in the United States. __EOS__ We should say, Dr. Tsvi Nussbaum. __EOS__ Yes, Dr. Tsvi Nussbaum. I must say, he took that claim hesitantly. He never stated it in definitive terms. And unfortunately, I believe he is not the little boy, although this photograph very much represents his traumatic experience, his traumatic moment in the Holocaust. ",0
51145," Yeah. __EOS__ Me coming to America and learning why. But at the same time you have to also hear that you have to walk a dog every day before you leave him behind walls. In a Third World country, people will say, well, that dog is frustrated. Let him do something. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ Take him for a walk, you know. That was my - my dad was fascinated when I told him, dad, I have a TV show. What do you mean? They're paying you for walking dogs? ",0
51146," No, that's not what I'm hearing. I haven't had too many of those conversations, but I've seen - you know, I've seen the guys who led the invasion are now criticizing Obama for having blown it. Let me just say, I think there's a reasonable criticism to be made of the Obama administration on the way that it left Iraq. I'm not really sure those are the guys to make it.__EOS__ So what do you think we could have done differently when we left Iraq?__EOS__ Well, you know, hindsight is cheap. But we left Iraq - the United States - the last American soldiers left Iraq in December of 2011. So basically it's been - we've gone for two and a half years. And when we left, it didn't work at all is basically what it came down to. And I think - I was talking to Ryan Crocker about this, a former American ambassador to Iraq. He's a really extraordinary diplomat. And he said the problem is that we built ourselves into the hard drive of the Iraqi system. And it doesn't really function without us. And basically what he meant by that is, you know, the Kurds and the Sunnis and the Shiite - they don't talk to each other, and they don't trust each other. And they can't cooperate, and they can't make deals. And we were the only people who could really kind of do that. And that was just a fact of life. And so I think the question - you know, I think that's a fair - I think if you look at the record, the way in which the United States left Iraq, you can ask yourself, was there a moment in which, say, we could have left behind - agreed with Iraqis to leave behind, you know, a few thousand Americans - not in combat roles but in the Green Zone. And there were lots of discussions to do just that between Maliki and the White House, and they broke down. They didn't go anywhere. And it's difficult to know exactly why, but I think it's fair to say that the White House didn't push very hard for it. They wanted to get out.__EOS__ Is it also fair to say Maliki didn't want us there anymore?",3
51147," I'm speaking with director David Cronenberg about his first novel - ""Consumed."" I could imagine this as a movie. Did this start out as a screenplay?__EOS__ It started out as a bit of a screenplay that I put aside very quickly because I felt I didn't know how to really advance it or develop it. And when I received a phone call from Nicole Winstanley, who's the publisher of Penguin Canada saying I've seen your movies. And I really think you could write a novel. And have you ever considered it? At which point I said yeah, only for about 50 years. Because I always thought I'd be a novelist. I never thought I'd be a filmmaker. I kind of got kidnapped by cinema.__EOS__ It's funny to hear you say though that this, you know, it's easier to imagine this as a novel because you've directed films where you've made films out of books that people said couldn't be made, you know, like William Burroughs' ""Naked Lunch"" and J.G. Ballard's ""Crash."" That seems to be what you almost specialize in.__EOS__ Yeah, it's true. I've often said you have to betray the novel in order to be faithful to the novel, because there is no direct translation. People talk about translating it. Well, there's no dictionary for that translation, you know. You really have to reinvent it for the cinema and, in so doing, you are - you're torturing it and you're brutalizing it. So I felt that that was not a process I wanted to subject my novel to, actually.",0
51148," This is an ethical entanglement. One, do you maintain your loyalty and your word or do you say my district went one direction and I am therefore ethically obligated to follow the district. Now, in the 5th District of Missouri, which I represent, we had almost a 50-50 split between Senators Obama and Clinton. So I'm not as compelled to consider following the district as some of the other members of Congress. I've got to - I think, struggle with this whole issue of ethics, and it's an internal struggle. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. What sort of lobbying is going on from other members of the congressional Black Caucus? Who are you hearing from? __EOS__ There is no lobbying. That's what is amazing. In fact, members of the Congressional Black Caucus end up joking about the race almost every day. I don't know of one single member who's become angry at another member because of who they are backing in the presidential primaries. __EOS__ What kind of joking? ",3
51149," Absolutely, because I don't think that it's right for people to receive more than they pay in. Now, unfortunately, this is not a bill President Obama negotiated. This is Nancy Pelosi's bill. No input from Republicans, no meetings, no amendments accepted in committee, and we vote tomorrow in the House on this legislation.  __EOS__ But what I hear you saying is there could be, as you say, long-term payouts for the president in dealing with House Republicans. But I'm not hearing any short-term payoff here. __EOS__ I do think in the long term, I think it really means a lot that he would come and speak with us. And in fairness, the president wasn't even in office when much of this was put together.  __EOS__ Well, how many Republican votes do you think it'll get in the House? ",3
51150," Talking with the chef, Gibney learns that tonight he'll be filling in for the cook who usually does the meat. He takes me over to the stove where he'll be working.__EOS__ Be careful not to touch that area over there because you'll burn yourself.__EOS__ It's already hot and he hasn't even started cooking yet.__EOS__ I'll be standing right here for about eight hours sweating profusely over slabs of meat that are going in and out of these ovens and I will be spinning around back and forth like this all night and then coordinating times and sending everything up there.",0

And it's lots of really funny stuff about all the things that she hates.__EOS__ I hate reality shows that are not reality. I mean I do not believe that all those housewives do is sit down, you spit in each other's face, you slap each other and then you go to a party together. You want to go  c'mon. Those kind of   reality shows I just think are so stupid. So stupid. Our show, one of the conditions that we did ""Joan and Melissa,"" was that we would have cameras following us around all the time so that we really - because enough happens in everybody's life that's interesting. And I don't want to stage, all Melissa, you walk over to me and spit in my face. That'll be good. You know, I don't have to worry because somewhere in the 24 hours she will do that.__EOS__ Do you ever regret that you've put your life and your daughter Melissa's life on camera, had fights on camera, you know, exposed things that other people would probably prefer to keep private in their lives?",0

51153," I'm just trying to ask what's our father's job. And that's the question. And I don't have the answer actually. Of course, my personal life is that I didn't really know my father. I met him, like, sometimes and he died in the Rwandan genocide. So that's why I was educated by my mother only. And, of course, it's a question that I have, but it's not because I didn't grow up with my father that I have this kind of question, it's just because I'm a man. The question is what's a good father, what's a father, what's a bad father? And actually the answer is we're just trying to do our best.__EOS__ The chorus is where are you, papa, where are you?__EOS__ Yes, that's it.__EOS__ And one of the lyrics that I think really struck me is the, you know, come on, tell us who does, everyone knows how babies are made, but no one knows how fathers are made, Mr. Know-it-all - it's in our blood, that's it. And - it's, like I said, it's - how did your mother feel about it? If you don't mind my asking.",2
51154," And Doc was...remind us about that story.__EOS__ Yeah, Doc Watson lived nearby. You know, he lived up in Deep Gap. And, of course, we knew him and listened to his records and were moved so by his sound. And we were busking on a street corner on the fifth of July, and I know it was the fifth because on the fourth was when we got that distiller. We had that steam keg from the Linville Hospital. They were closing it down, right, and Bennie bought the old steamer.__EOS__ Steam keg?__EOS__ Well, we had made liquor on the stovetop before but we had never made it, you know, on the fire. And this was, like, a thump keg and there were fireworks. And remember I drank that white gas.",2
51155," Yes, hi Neal, hi Doctor. It's a pleasure to be on your show. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ I had a, this ones a little bit negative, unfortunately. My moms is in an assisted living, and her physician taking care of her when she was in the hospital, when they dismissed her from the hospital, there's an 1823 form that the doctor signs so that she can get all of the medication that she takes when she goes back to the assisted living.

51157," The maverick Harry Bosch and his creator both solve cases while on the road listening to jazz. And they're contemplative about the city that inspires them. __EOS__ The randomness of this place, the idea that anything can happen both good and bad; and it can happen pretty quickly. People can become overnight famous in this place for the good things they've done, maybe the creative things they've done, and oftentimes it's for the horrible things they've done. __EOS__ Listening to Bosch's theme song, Connelly winds along Mulholland Drive and up to where Harry Bosch's house was red-tagged after an earthquake. From this vantage point high in the Hollywood Hills, Connelly looks out over the canyon to the endless ribbon of red lights on the freeway. __EOS__ It's a city that's, you know, beautiful and damaged, that has so much that appears to be going for it, but it falls short in so many ways. And it's just like a person, you know, a flawed character. ",0
51158," This is very cool stuff. I'm just curious, though, who is the audience for this? Is it an electronic crowd? Is it, like, the young club scene people, or is it people going to see chamber music in downtowns across America?__EOS__ Well, I think it is definitely younger people. I mean, it's not the people that go hear Haydn's string quartet at a museum. But there are more and more people paying attention to this kind of music, and it's making headway into a lot of different places. I mean, you're going to hear this music in clubs rather than concert halls.__EOS__ Wow.__EOS__ But you'll hear it in concert halls too.",2
51159," There was such passion, such total devotion. __EOS__ She has a very powerful voice with a lot of nasal resonance, and this is all good. __EOS__ Ethnomusicologist Virginia Danielson is a renowned expert on Umm Kulthum. But at first, she did not understand what cued those cheers of approval during Umm Kulthum's songs. She learned the audience responded whenever the singer closed the gap between poetry and emotion. __EOS__ When Umm Kulthum sings the words, I'm afraid your heart belongs to somebody else, she completely nails the way that anguish should sound.

51160," The Martin Luther King exhortation - it's in response to why don't you wait for the changes that you've been calling for. This is a sentence that runs on for the better part of a page. __EOS__ Yes, it does. And I haven't even given the entire sentence in my book. And that kind of sentence depends on the parallel repetition of a single, syntactical form, which accumulates power. But because you're staying with the single form, even as it gets longer and longer, you are not confused. Instead, you are free to experience the extraordinary pressure that that sentence exerts on its readers. It's a marvelous sentence. __EOS__ This is - well, Martin Luther King is hard to imitate. The point being, if you're going to be speaking - Cicero, a famous orator, we don't have recordings of what he sounded like; obviously, we do of Martin Luther King, an extraordinary orator - you'd better be writing for your own voice, and know how you breathe as well. __EOS__ Absolutely.

51161," Well, beekeeping is a bit cheaper than belonging to a golf club, for starters. I'm not very good at golf. In fact, I don't really like golf at all. And I find beekeeping a much more satisfying, if slightly more painful pastime, in that respect. But I get an enormous amount out of it. It's a terrific antidote for me to - through all the television and broadcast, the pressures, the lights and the studio, and people gabbing in your ear all the time - and I come away from that pressure cooker atmosphere and go on and open up a beehive. And my mind is completely wiped clear by the concentration that I have to put into looking into this city of bees. __EOS__ Well, let me put it this way  How many times have you been stung? __EOS__ When I started off, I was getting this stung may be six to eight times a season. This year though, so far, fingers crossed, I have barely been stung at all apart from one very, very sensitive place, which probably doesn't bear talking about on NPR. __EOS__ But the job was, when I started, and you're a bit clumsy anyways as a new beekeeper. I used to swell up very badly. And gradually, my system has become used to it so it's not nearly so bad. And the great thing is when the pain wears off, it's really, really quite pleasurable. Because it's such an intense feeling of pain, you know, you get stung and sometimes you can feel it's going to happen cause the bees sort of buzzes slightly. And you go, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ooh. And, you know, you just get used to it after while. ",0

Are you going to study his      films and try to really be as much of him as you can be, or are you going      to try to bring a little bit of yourself to the role, or both? __EOS__  Well, I'm going to play me.  I'm going to play me in Richard      Pryor because, you know, I think it's an insult to do impressions.  I      want to approach it like Denzel approached Malcolm X, like Jamie      approached Ray. There's just so much to draw from from myself that'll      help me play Richard Pryor, you know.  It's going to be some big shoes to      fill.

51163," The song is called ""Linda Manana"" or ""Beautiful Morning."" It's an example of the cumbia that you would have heard back in the '60s and '70s, you know, with the big, brassy sound in the heyday, the golden age of cumbia in Colombia. And for this particular recording, they went back to the old Discos Fuentes studios in Medellin, Colombia, the label that put out the best Colombian music back in the day, and they brought back the same engineer that worked on those records, and they recorded on reel to reel. And what you hear, this kind of big band recreating the old sound for the 21st century. Just heavenly stuff.__EOS__ It's fantastic. The band is called Ondatropica, and they're just one of the many artists you can hear on Betto Arcos' show, ""Global Village,"" on KPFK in Los Angeles. Betto, thanks so much for popping by. And we'll talk to you gain in a couple of weeks.__EOS__ Thank you for having me.__EOS__ And for Saturday, that's WEEKENDS on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Guy Raz.

51164," But there have been reports that President Museveni said he would sign this bill only if the death penalty was removed from it. __EOS__ Yeah, I think thats actually a real possibility, that the death penalty will be removed from it. And unfortunately we have this situation right now, where there's, especially some of the American groups that have sort of been involved and are supporting it, they're going to declare that a human rights victory - a law that provides life in prison for homosexuality - long prison terms for even this conversation we're having right now, they're going to call that a human rights victory. __EOS__ You keep referring to Museveni as a dictator. Is he commonly regarded as a dictator? __EOS__ It's a little bit debated, but he's been in power for - since 1986 - 24 years. He changed the constitution to keep being re-elected. If he doesnt like you, you get killed, you get thrown in prison. It's a much more softer dictatorship. But yeah, he's pretty commonly referred to as a dictator. ",3
51165," You have released this book of photographs. You have moved to L.A. into a house, into a neighborhood that feels more like home to you. Are you starting a new chapter for yourself? __EOS__ I have no idea because, like, if I answer yes, that's just an invitation to step out on a street and get hit by a bus, you know. So if I say to you that, yes, this is a new chapter and I'm so optimistic and everything is going to work out, that just means a piano's going to fall on my head. So you know, the best-case scenario, things work out and - we all still die, so it seems like our effort should go towards trying to make - not necessarily understand the universe in which we live, just try and make peace with our role in it. __EOS__ That's the musician Moby. His new album and photography book, both called ""Destroyed,"" were released last month. Moby, thanks very much for talking with us. __EOS__ Oh, it was my pleasure. I feel like we've had a therapy session. I'll send you $250. ",2
51166," You said that you got to know both sides of the crime, those who commit crimes and the victims. When and how did you get to know victims? __EOS__ Well, certainly in the courtrooms I went to, and I had different students and everything, and I would see the victims testify. And it's incredibly moving. And to be honest, the ones that are badly spoken are better at it even, because it's - you realize how uncomfortable they are to be there and how terrible this is for them and they're never going to get over it. And yet, what do you do? The other person is alive. I'm an optimist. I believe in life. I believe that some people can change. Believe me, I think there's plenty of people that should never get out of jail  the serial killers, people that have done the same thing over and over, child molesters. I'm not for - I'm talking about Leslie is a special case. __EOS__ You know, media coverage and films can certainly have an impact on how cases proceed and it's certainly impacted Leslie Van Houten and every other member of - and, you know, and everyone involved in the Manson case. I mean the film ""Helter Skelter"" was made many years ago. And then in 2003... __EOS__ There's a couple of them. Yeah. ",0
51167," This is FRESH AIR. Im Terry Gross. __EOS__  I search for phrases to sing your praises. But there aren't any magic adjectives to tell you all you are. You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words. Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby, amorous. It's all too wonderful. I'll never find the words that say enough, tell enough, I mean, they're just not swell enough. __EOS__ Margaret Whiting, I bet you remember when your father wrote that song. __EOS__ Well, kind of because I was quite young when he wrote it. He wrote it with Johnny Mercer and it was for Ruby Keeler in a picture called ""Ready, Willing & Able."" It had to be before 1938 and I'm not sure of the year but I was still young. But I remember going into my father's studio every day when I came home from school or when my mother would allow me in and he would always play what he'd written that day, so I remember hearing it and liking it and I still do. ",2
51168," So they're not ready to take all the stylists ? __EOS__ No. I mean, everything - everyone seemed to take it in the right way for the most part. You know, I think I got more grief about the jeans than anything else except the shirt was fairly blousy, so that was kind of more of an underground event than anything else. But it was - that was probably the thing I took the most stride in about. __EOS__ How did it  - there was a woman there who we gave a makeover to who had, I think on the last casual Friday, even though she's like a size 2, wore her old maternity clothes. __EOS__ She looked great. We didn't actually have any interaction, the three of us that day, but everyone looked great. ",3
51169," You wrote a sort of anthem, a lovely anthem on this new album called I Hear Them All. Tell me about that song. __EOS__ Well, I Hear Them All is a sort of a song about listening. It's a song about listening with a kind of collective ear to all of the sounds that humanity is making I guess. And being able to hear them all at once and to know that the sounds you're making are the sounds that everyone's making. __EOS__  So while you sit and whistle Dixie with your money and your power, I can hear the flowers a-growing in the rubble of the towers. I hear leaders quit their lying. I hear babies quit their crying. I hear soldiers quit their dying one and all. I hear them all. I hear them all. I hear them all. __EOS__ Well, Ketch Secor, thanks very much. ",2
51170," Other parents.__EOS__ Other parents because other parents are the worst.__EOS__ Exactly. And you outlined the various types of the worst, some of which I actually hadn't heard of. One is that lady who drops her kids off at the playground and then goes for a run.__EOS__ Yeah.",0
51171," Yeah. __EOS__ …of sketches called Acting with James Franco, in which you give acting tips to your younger brother. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And it's got like a send-up of acting classes and of the Method, and one of them is all about like James Dean and ""Rebel Without A Cause."" And you go through a scene with your brother that's a reenactment of a scene from ""Rebel Without A Cause"". Describe the scene that you're reenacting in this. ",3
51172," No, no, I'm not really a musical guy, but if you just started like the opening, , like the opening of ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" I could probably sing every note and every word from beginning to end. I love that musical.__EOS__ I don't even know if it's good. Do you know what I mean? At this point, I have no idea whether it's even a good musical. It's just, it's just too much, like, in my DNA.__EOS__ Right, right, OK. So let's move on to another recording that you named as one that's been important to you, and this is Elvis Costello, who unlike King Herod has actually been on your show several times, including on your great holiday special a few years ago.__EOS__ Right.",2
51173," I have read that quote to some audiences, and I read it recently, and to my surprise the audience started cheering. They just felt that summarized, at least that's the way I took it, the problems of today, that George Romney way back those years ago has summarized views that are even more relevant today perhaps than they were then, because that seems to be where we are.__EOS__ So your book is called ""The Real Romney,"" and Scott, I want to ask you  If you compare how Romney is running now in his presidential campaign to how he ran in his gubernatorial or Senate campaigns, are they all - is he consistent in those campaigns, or are there things that lead you to ask who is the real Romney, comparing those campaigns?__EOS__ I think it's incredibly inconsistent, actually. I mean, certainly there are some consistencies that we see. I mean, in '94, when he first ran for Senate, and now, he's a man who cares very much about his family and his faith and so forth. There's certain bedrock principles, I think, to him that have not changed. But when you think about him politically, they're two completely different Mitt Romneys.__EOS__ In your book ""The Real Romney,"" you write a lot about not only Mitt Romney's commitment to the Mormon Church but the history of his family in the church. His great-great-grandfather was a part of the church back in the Joseph Smith era. Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",0
51174," I wanted to see what was that everybody was talking about that was supposed to be so dangerous. I knew heroin was extremely dangerous and could kill you. Yeah, cocaine could, I mean, kill you, but it's not the same kind of killer that heroin is. And I tried it, and the first time I inhaled it, I knew I had made a major mistake. And I said to myself, oh, I should have never done this. I had no idea that I'd stepped over that line that I had drawn, even though I'd kept it to a kind of minimum because I was so afraid and embarrassed about what I was doing that I spaced things apart for - I had long breaks between when I would do that. But this went on for a few years.__EOS__ You describe disappearing on your way home from the airport one night, your family having to track you down. That was what lead to what you describe as an intervention, although I guess it was a kind of improvised intervention. Everybody came together and told you this is it.__EOS__ What happened is I came home from one of these, quote, ""sessions,"" unquote, and my wife said, come to one of my other rooms. And my daughter was there and two other really, really close friends of mine, and I just broke down crying because I was high, and I was embarrassed beyond belief. But a part of me was relieved because I knew it was the end of the line for something that I wanted to end, but I wasn't able to do it really by myself and I needed to go to rehab. And that was what did it, and I haven't gone back to that since. And I never, never will.__EOS__ Did drugs ever affect your music in any way, for better or for worse?",2
51175," I still have it, although I don't make too many entries now. I've always kept journals, since I was 14 or so, for special experiences, whether it's traveling, going on a botanical excursion in Oaxaca, or lose - or having leg surgery or having an eye problem. __EOS__ Would you describe when you knew something was going wrong with your eye? And this was in December of 2005. __EOS__ Yes, it was a Saturday morning. I had gone for a swim, as I usually do, and then I went to the movies. And while the previews were on, I suddenly became conscious of a strange - some sort of visual instability and fluttering to my left. __EOS__ You've got something behind the retina. He said it could be a blood clot. It could be a tumor. He said if it's a tumor, I want to go over the worst possible scenario with you. ",0
51176," Yes. He made Jeff Davis pies, the one that's in the book. He used to make wonderful roast lamb. You'd take all the fat off, he said. And I remember him making a roast turkey. He would always take the best part of the turkey for himself, when he carved it. He had learned how to cook in France. And when he came back to New York, when he lived in the Chelsea Hotel he used to give wonderful dinner parties. __EOS__ Was he a good dinner party guest? __EOS__ Well, he always would fall asleep at the table at least once. And then people would sort of relax and start talking away, thinking he was asleep, and he would suddenly wake up out of the blue and snap at whoever was speaking - saying, absolutely wrong, absolute rubbish. And back he was in the swing of things. __EOS__ What do you think is the most exotic thing you've ever eaten? ",0
51177," Michael, take me back. Tell us a little bit about your first encounter with Gurrulmul whom I've seen described not only as your close friend, you not only produce the music and play double bass, I've even seen you described him as an adoptive brother. How did you meet this fellow?__EOS__ I was working for the University up here and running a music course and so I ended up on his island. A lot of music comes out of that place. And the fellow who was really keen to get a band going needed, you know, some other people in the band so he went and grabbed Gurrumul who'd been traveling around the world with a big band from Australia up to seven years before that. So he knew a lot about music. That night, he appeared in the doorway and like I said before it's quite confronting when you first meet Gurrumul 'cause he relies on people to lead him and guard him and finds that the most reliable way because he's constantly asking you what's this like, what's that like. Anyway, I met him and he's physical with you and he sat down and started playing and singing and we were immediately struck and recognized how special he was. He and I developed a friendship from there and I helped his band record a few albums. He's intuitive, he's funny, he's very shy and very reclusive in some ways and I think part of that is a big safety mechanism for him and a survival technique but he's incredibly talented and sometimes you can name drop and say when we were in Paris playing with Sting you could feel this musicianship coming to the fore in the more time you spend with him the more that musicianship comes out. And when you get the sort of affirmation from the top, you know, that you're thinking the right way and not just biased because it's a musician that you work with.__EOS__ .__EOS__ Thank you very much for talking with us about your friend and for describing and explaining some of his music for us.",2
51178," Yes.__EOS__ And do you see a way out of that?__EOS__ Well, we've tried to make this documentary to start a conversation. I think if people were more educated on what HIV is and how to deal with it and how to make sure not to get it - I mean, with the advances in...__EOS__ Prevention is one thing, stigma is another. Elton...",0
51179," One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. But the way I played before was, I say 11 so same thing counts from one to 11. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.  __EOS__ If you want to make a ton of money and not work too hard, don't go into jazz. When he's not working or traveling, Loueke practices a lot. He says that he and the rest of his trio, bassist Massimo Biolcati and Ferenc Nemeth, can also work together many hours a day. __EOS__ You know, every time I do a gig with different musicians, of course, I always learn something. I just want to be a musician, I don't want to be a specific musician that can play only one style of music. __EOS__ On his new CD, Karibu, his first for jazz label Blue Note, Loueke's compositions grow from his African roots but quickly stretch and spread into complex guitar voicings, harmonies, and meters. The result, however, doesn't come off like a dry musical exercise. The songs feel like a fresh, organic amalgam of a well-traveled musical life, performed by someone who's put in the time to become a master of his instrument. ",2
51180,"  Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand? __EOS__ That's Patti Smith's first studio recording, a single she made in 1974, in Jimi Hendrix's studio, Electric Lady. Before Patti Smith earned the name the godmother of punk, she was - well, that's the subject of her new memoir, ""Just Kids."" It's about growing up in New Jersey, moving to New York in 1967, and slowly evolving into a poet, songwriter and performer. __EOS__ Well, I was a lower-middle-class kid. My family had no money. There was no room in our small house, where there were already four kids, including myself, living. I would have had to get a job in a factory, ask my mother to help me, and she was already overworked. She was a waitress. It would've been difficult for everyone, I think, and the child would have had no father. I felt that I just wasn't ready as a human being, I wasn't prepared, and that although I knew that I would be responsible and loving, that I just was not equipped to embark on that path. __EOS__ I think that this pregnancy was a turning point in your life and contributed to your decision to leave college, give up on the idea of being a teacher and go to New York. It's in New York that you met Robert Mapplethorpe, and you know, you changed the course of each other's lives. Would you tell the story of how you met Robert Mapplethorpe? ",2
51181," And he did. And… __EOS__ And that is - we're going to have leave right there. In order to find out the rest of that story, you're going to have to go to Bonnie's book, ""American Chinatown  A People's History of Five Neighborhoods."" __EOS__ Thank you so much, Lynn. __EOS__ Coming up, victims of GPS, wrong turns and dead ends.

51182," Well, it's a good structure for discipline, and you need that. And I always wondered when I was working with ""The Tonight Show,"" I said, what made me  what gave me the prerequisites to do this job with, you know, a certain amount of ease and longevity? And I think it was that the mixture of discipline and creativity and music and thats basically what my childhood was largely rooted in. So it kind of hit me one day, and its like wow, you know, this is certainly coming in handy. __EOS__ Well, you know, I was curious about that, how you balanced the demands of being a bandleader and a broadcast personality with wanting to do your own creative work. Now you moved to L.A. to be on The Tonight Show in 1992. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ Thats the year you put out the album Turning Point. Lets play a little bit. ",2
51183," Fulbright ended up, as I understand it, dealing - ironically enough -with Martin Luther King, because while they disagreed on segregation they both opposed the war in Vietnam. __EOS__ That's right. And we went to the - you know, the Reynolds tobacco group people? __EOS__ Oh, R.J. Reynolds. __EOS__ R.J. Reynolds, the tobacco people, you know. Fulbright and Reynolds were very good friends. Went there one night, and I met Martin Luther King there. I was out there waiting for Fulbright, and he called and told me to come in. He said, Reverend King, I would like for you to meet Bertie, my staff, my driver, my everything. He's a good man. And I was really shocked, you know, that he took the time to call me in to introduce me. But that was a good deal. ",0
51184," Well, I have to say that 40 years ago, whenever that was...__EOS__ I know when I started to write, it was the '70s, and throughout that decade, we didn't have any problems with book challenges or censorship. It all started really in a big way in 1980.__EOS__ And why, do you think?__EOS__ Well, it came with the election, the presidential election of 1980, and the next day, I've been told, the censors were crawling out of the woodwork and challenging, like it's our turn now, and we're going to say what we don't want our children to read.",0
51185," Right. So back in about 2000, you know, when Amazon was not profitable and the dot-com bubble was turning into the dot-com bust, some executives at Amazon decided that, you know, they needed to kind of branch out and find new sources of revenue. And one idea which immediately got some traction was, you know, let's go and use our expertise to go run the sites of some other retailers. And they did strike deals with Toys ""R"" Us, with Target, with Borders, with Circuit City, and then some smarter retailers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy decided that it was a great idea and while there were talks. they never led to anything. And these were horrible deals for everyone. You know, the retailers that relied on Amazon, like Circuit City and Borders, I mean both those companies are out of business. And I would argue that the fact that they outsourced their e-commerce responsibilities was a big reason why. Target finally weaned itself off Amazon in 2012 and they had a horrible year. I mean it was a very difficult evolution trying to figure out how to run it themselves. So it was a moment where Amazon was looking at some new opportunities, but ultimately it didn't want to be in the business of helping its competitors, and its competitors finally realized that it was disastrous to go and create a dependency on their biggest competition.__EOS__ In what way do you think Borders' outsourcing of its e-commerce to Amazon contributed to Borders bankruptcy?__EOS__ Well, Borders customers, any book buyer, you know, wants to buy in physical stores but they want to buy online. They want to buy physical books but, as we know now, they also want to buy digital books. And by declining at this very key moment to get technically sophisticated in the ways that the new business environment would require, you know, Borders lost a key opportunity and ultimately, by the time that they figured it out, we were in the Great Recession. They couldn't raise capital. They had some profitable stores and some unprofitable stores and the result was they went out of business.__EOS__ My guest is Brad Stone, author of the new book ""The Everything Store  Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon."" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH Air.",0
51186," A lot of people get kind of hung up on her being his lover. They fall in love. It's a very human and beautiful thing.__EOS__ Nathan Gunn sings the role of Jesus, called Yeshua, his Hebrew name, in the opera.__EOS__ They teach each other things, too. It's kind of like the whole yin and yang symbol. You know, he's very yang. He's missing the yin and she's missing sort of the yang. They complement each other.__EOS__ The role of Mary is sung by Sasha Cooke.",2
51187," You always try to read between the lines in the State of the Union address. Any advice on what to look for in President Obamas State of Union address when he is talking about Iraq and Afghanistan, which I assume he will say something about? __EOS__ Ive been struck in listening to President Obamas big speeches this year. His speech on Afghanistan at West Point and a couple of the other foreign policy statements he made, especially his Nobel Prize address. They strike me as odes to ambivalence, in which - he kept on talking about Nobel Peace Prize about Martin Luther King. I think he mentioned Dr. King six times. And I read the whole speech almost as an apology to Dr. King. Here I am escalating in Afghanistan while I accept the Peace Prize and Im only in this job because of what you, Dr. King, did. __EOS__ As somebody who has been saying for years there are no good solutions in Iraq, and you probably believe the same about Afghanistan, do you emphasize was that ambivalence that you sense in the president? __EOS__ I sure do. I think its probably exactly the right feeling to have. It's just, unfortunately for him, he's not a writer. He's a political leader. ",0
51188," Oh, I have. I cooked for seven years at the restaurant. __EOS__ Oh, you did, okay. __EOS__ Oh yes, oh yes. __EOS__ And you gave that up because? ",3
51189," My, my. Why, this is most irregular. __EOS__ Well, I just can't believe my eyes. __EOS__ They ain't dead, is they? __EOS__ No. Dead people don't snore, or do they? ",1
51190," Well, I think not. I think at this point, we want to give every advantage we can to General Petraeus, to the men and women that are doing the hard work everyday and in particular, to Prime Minister Maliki. And I think what we ought to do is pass a bill that will allow for the money for our troops and then look very carefully at what General Petraeus can tell us in September. __EOS__ Back in February, you said that Iraqis need to continue to take control of the security situation. You said, we will provide additional manpower and resources to calm the violence, but it's time for the Iraqi government to take bold action. That was February, now it's almost May. Are you seeing the kind of action that you'd hoped for? __EOS__ I think the difference between now and February is that we're sending 20,000 more troops there - six per dates. We have new people. We have new players. We have more military. And now I think… __EOS__ But that's only with U.S. side. You said the Iraqi government needs to take bold action, do you think that's happening? ",3
51191," In Hendrix character? Did you...__EOS__ It was excellent.__EOS__ Did you speak Hendrix when you went out with them?__EOS__ No. Well, I cheated to be honest. I did not. I did not. I did not. I was, you know, just me. I mean, at times I would break into it, but for the most - you know, I was getting to know them. I was nervous, you know, they were true actors and - you know, so my nerves had to go at first, but yeah. That was the best thing for this movie, so I didn't have to jump on screen and act like I knew these women. Like, I actually knew them and thought they were cool and, you know, there was an attraction there. So it was, you know, it could be seen on screen.",1
51192," And what about the reaction in Carthage, Texas, because we are talking about a real woman here, an 81-year-old woman who was killed who lived in that town? It's presented as a comedy, but it is a murder.__EOS__ There was a lot of controversy over the movie. But at the same time, there were plenty of people, including Danny Buck, who thought the movie was fairly accurate in exactly what it portrayed all the characters out to be.__EOS__ Did this story make you at all uncomfortable as a reporter or your work on the movie, that line between humor and tragedy and death?__EOS__ I think there was always the concern that people would think we were making fun of a death or we were parodying the people of East Texas. So, that's why we tried to keep the story as accurate as possible and let it play out. And Rick would always remind the actors, don't overact. This is what happened. You don't have to be campy. This is the way it happened, and let's play it as it happened.",1
51193,"  Sandwich, Illinois, yes, sir. __EOS__  Go ahead. __EOS__  I have a question.  Do girls play different games than      boys--video games? __EOS__  That's a great question.  The Sims--as we keep--keeps      coming up--that has I think at this point it's over 50 percent women.  I      think that's what Will told us the other night.  I know it's hovered      around there for a while, and I think it's actually crossed it.  The      other thing that's really interesting about women gamers is you notice      that a lot of women don't self-identify as gamers, but if you probe a      little bit further, you will find that they are indeed. ",0
51194," It does indeed, and Bobby… __EOS__ You were only 6 years old, and yet it made such an impression on you. How is that? Why is that? __EOS__ Well, I consider myself a child of the ‘60s, albeit a young child. And I was difficult in, especially in 1968, which was indeed the year that shook the world, when you think about it. It started with the Tet offensive, then Cronkite came back from Vietnam and said on national television that the war is unwinnable. And Johnson said if I don't have Cronkite, I don't have the American people, I've lost the American people. __EOS__ We are talking with Emilio Estevez about his new movie, Bobby. And you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. ",3
51195," Yeah. You did a lot of directing in television for some really great shows - I mean, ""Undeclared"" and ""Arrested Development."" You want to just tell us a little how you got into that and what that experience was like? __EOS__ Well, when I came out of film school, I was hoping to emulate heroes of mine like Woody Allen, and kind of write and direct my own small movies. And then I realized that that's actually quite hard to do. It's very hard to be Woody Allen. And I realized I just need to be working, and I just need to work with good people. And Judd Apatow called me and asked me if I wanted to direct an episode of his second television series ""Undeclared."" And I think before he finished the sentence, I yelled yes several times... __EOS__ ...and essentially moved from Manhattan to Los Angeles immediately, because I was dying to get experience. And it was one of the better decisions I've made in my life. __EOS__ Is there an episode or a particular moment that you really treasure? ",1
51196," ...that was not going to make me popular. But when I moved to California and I met a lot of comedians and we all had similar interests, it really was like that Blind Melon song, where the Bee Girl walks in the field and then there's all the people dressed like bees, that's how I felt when I came to California. __EOS__ So many of the characters in your films, including ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" and ""Knocked Up,"" and the new one, ""Funny People"" are so you know ambivalent about becoming really adult and about entering into a committed relationship or staying in a committed relationship. So where does that fear or ambivalence come from? Is it from observing other people or something you had to deal with yourself? __EOS__ You know I'm not very ambivalent about it. I'm so happy to be married. I can't believe my wife is there every day. I'm just I think that we're on a first date and she's going to climb out the window when we go to a restaurant. __EOS__ I feel like I've lucked out. On some level I feel like I've tricked her and she's married to me and I feel bad that she's not allowed to escape. So there's no ambivalence on my part. I'm really, really happy and have these incredible kids that I just I don't even know how it happened. Now, I write about people who are unhappy is because I don't think there's anything funny in happiness. People who are really comfortable with their situation, I just don't want to watch in a movie theater. I'd like to hang out at a barbecue with them but there's no drama in things going well. ",1
51197," Now you advise eating your last meal of the day, I think, four to five hours before you go to bed, but then having a light snack - how long before you go to bed?__EOS__ About an hour before you go to bed.__EOS__ And why is that helpful to have a snack?__EOS__ Well, it could be helpful for two reasons. Firstly, we all know how hard it is to fall asleep if you're hungry, so you want to avoid that. But secondly, there are certain foods which contain proteins which actually promote sleep. And so and what they are is proteins that get broken down and processed to form neurotransmitters that promote sleep. And so if you have a snack that contains those, it can actually help you to sleep.",0
51198,"  Well, they don't know what to do with Lucy.  Tom has a      half-sister, Pamela, who lives up in Burlington, Vermont, and they call      her and eventually, she agrees to take the girl in for a while.  So they      take off for Vermont.  Now Lucy doesn't want to go there.  She likes her      two uncles very much, and she'd preferred to stay with them. __EOS__  Tom and Nathan. __EOS__  Tom and Nathan.  So they get in the car and she's sulking      all the way up in silence.  But then they stop for lunch somewhere, and      Lucy very cleverly sabotages the car by pouring 20 or 30 cans of      Coca-Cola into the gas tank, which is an excellent way to ruin an engine.      And so they get stuck and, therefore, they stay in this little part of      southern Vermont for a while, where they live in a place called the      Chowder Inn.  And this is where... __EOS__  The name of that is just great. ",0
51199," And the point of putting them together like that - or is there a point of putting them together like that?__EOS__ I think there sort of is a way in which it does make sense to put them together like that. I mean, for the sake of this kind of a reading of the life of Mrs. Nixon, because even though it may be a little bit subtle I think that you pick up a kind of cryptic quality about it and that is a kind of limitation that I have in that I never was privy to these scenes.__EOS__ Now there are two things that seem to be very important about her. Why did she marry Richard Nixon? And what did she think in the end about what happened to him and to them? Do you think you understand anything more about these questions that you raised than you did when you started?__EOS__ I don't think I have a clear answer to something that as far as I'm aware of really doesn't exist. In other words, there isn't a diary and Mrs. Nixon, you know, wrestles on the page with whether or not she should marry Mr. Nixon. In effect though, we can certainly go back and look at when their first meeting was, see that she moved away from that community for a period of time, moved back and did not phone him, that it was quite a while. He has really had to sort of lobby to get her back in his life in any way. So there are moments like that that are obviously very telling moments. Other times I used particular things as a kind of stepping off point, but really and that the book was written so much not knowing what I would arrive at the end of the book. They were stepping-off moments into space, and often I stay in space. I wonder if she did to sometimes.",0
51200,"  Yeah.  I have a question.  I can relate to what he's saying      because I'm myself from Liberia, West Africa.  I came here during the      civil war up there. I was lucky enough, you know, to come to America.      And since I've been here, I haven't seen my mother for 22 years, and I'm      trying to get some preparation to go back to Liberia to bring her over      here, so the 18th of this month I'm traveling to Liberia.  My question is      now that he's here in the States, what kind of action is he taking now to      sort of go back to get his mother over here? __EOS__  Yeah.  Actually at this particular time I'm trying to get      myself, you know, in a better shape.  What I mean by that is get out that      revenge and anger and depression--you know, get rid of all those stuff      and so that I'm able to help somebody, and that is if I also help myself,      so what I'm doing now is taking time and to share my story with young      people, talking to a community college and universities and also the      Amnesty International, so it's already a little help though, and they had      me taking few actions signing the petitions and getting the word out to      American people something that good can happen.  It start like that, but      I'm still just taking my time. __EOS__  Are you planning to bring your mother back here to the States,      though? __EOS__  I have that plan, but I haven't brought up that to her because      maybe not.  She--few months ago she couldn't even talk, you know, to me      about anything at home, every time I ask a question--What happened to      this and that person?--you know, she was like skip those, so I realized      she needs some time. But I have that plan, so see what she will say about      that, if she wants to come to the States. ",0
51201," Kevin, I'm going to ask you this question.__EOS__ Sure.__EOS__ We often like to ask people who, if they have - some people who've made an impact, if they had some wisdom that they can share about their journey - somebody who's listening to our conversation, who maybe has a dream like you had?__EOS__ Yeah. Really, really focus. If it's something that truly makes you happy and it's legal - not illegal - but it's something that truly, you know, you really get excited about, don't let anybody take that away from you. Focus on it, and continue to strive to where you want to be with whatever that talent is - whatever that, you know, that you really want to do. Don't let anybody stop you.",3
51202," That's right. For some reason there are certain habits that seem to matter more than others. We call these keystone habits. And if you can change a keystone habit, you unlock all these other patterns in someone's life or in an organization. And the best example of this is Alcoa, the largest aluminum company on Earth when Paul O'Neill took it over, and Paul O'Neill later became Treasury secretary. When he first got hired, everyone expected him to come in and say I'm going to concentrate on profits and efficiency and making people work harder. But instead what he said was my number one priority is transforming worker safety habits within this company so that we have zero injuries, which is a big deal in a company where all of your employees handle molten metal.__EOS__ How did the crescendo of other better habits fall out of changing one habit?__EOS__ One of the characteristics of a keystone habit is that it creates a culture. That's why it seems to have such a profound influence on other patterns in our lives. For a long time, all the managers and the employees had kind of been at odds. In fact, there had been this huge strike of 15,000 workers at Alcoa. And then Paul O'Neill comes in and says here's something that both of us can agree on  We need to change our habits around worker safety. And management and workers were able to sit down at the same table, and all of a sudden they realized to change those habits, to make safety automatic, you have to do certain things - like, for instance, you have to look at your production line. When does the manufacturing process get out of whack? Because an out-of-whack manufacturing process is dangerous to employees. It also creates subpar aluminum. So if we make it safer for employees, if we bring everything in line, we actually make better aluminum also. By focusing on this one keystone habit, worker safety, Paul O'Neill set off a series of changes through the corporation that made it one of the most profitable companies on Earth and one of the most efficient companies ever.__EOS__ There's another example you use. It's for a particular product, Febreze, which is a pretty successful product now. But when it was introduced back in the '90s, it was a tough sell.",0
51203,"  I didn't want to be like Mike, but at the same time, that      level of musicianship, of creativity, of entertainment.  I'm seeing all      of that and I'm like, `I'm gonna do that, you know.  I'm gonna do it.'      But when you say that, you have to see the end result.  I always saw the      video frame by frame. I heard all the music. __EOS__   You gotta do what you can, do what you can,      do what you can, yeah, do what you can.  Do what you can, do what you      can. __EOS__  To put that vision on tape, Butler enlisted Mary Ann Viera and      Craig Irving, two East Coast hip hop fans Butler met while attending      college in Massachusetts.  They all moved to New York City and formed      Digable Planets. __EOS__   We jazz up the streets to prove we have      beats. Fat jazz fat style and the sound so sweet.  And there ain't no      doubt that you got to check.  Doodle.  Butter.  Mec. ",2
51204,"  OK. __EOS__  So they love them, though.  I mean, my wife actually shows them videos and stuff of how they kill animals and different things, and they give me a hard time if they see me eating some chicken, like, oh, daddy, you're eating feathers and wings and legs, you know.  So I try not to eat too much meat in front of them, you know. __EOS__  OK, all right.  Chef Jeff Henderson is the author of ""Chef Jeff Cooks.""  His new cookbook is in bookstores now.  His new reality show, ""The Chef Jeff Project,"" premieres on the Food Network on October 12th.  We'll have more information at our website, npr.org/tellmemore.  Chef Jeff, thank you so much for joining us. And thank you, good luck with all your projects. __EOS__  Thank you for having me. ",0
51205," Is there a story behind it you'd like to tell - behind writing it?__EOS__ Not really, no. This really is - I was walking along the street and saw a sign saying house for sale, and it says - those three words, you know, you see them all the time, house for sale. And I thought  I wonder if anyone's ever written a song called ""House For Sale."" It's so simple, and yet it's got a great scope for a little song about why someone would sell their house. Yes, I didn't - there's no hidden meaning in this one at all, really.__EOS__ Okay.__EOS__  House for sale, I'm moving out. I'm moving on. This bird has flown. House for sale. I'll tell you where to redirect my mail. House for sale, take a look inside. This is where love once did reside. But now it's gone, and that's the reason I'll be traveling on.",2
51206,"  Everything I do is just a little wrong. Every day for me is the same. Everyone I know is getting in my face and I only got myself to blame. I think I'm gonna wreck this heart... __EOS__ The album “Face the Promise” has Seger touring at age 61, the first time in a decade. Last month he made headlines when he played outside Detroit, headquarters of the industry where he briefly worked as a young man. __EOS__ Well, my father worked at Ford's for 19 years. I even worked at Ford's for a short time and at GM for a short time. __EOS__ What were your jobs? ",2
51207," When Irma Thomas heard she was chosen as one of NPR's 50 Great Voices... __EOS__ I kind of lit up, like, wow, I'm among 50 great voices.

51208," With a record as evocative as ""Astral Weeks,"" there's a nagging desire to understand what in Morrison's life inspired it — to know where the songs come from, what they mean. __EOS__ No, no, no, because it's not about me. It's totally fictional. These are short stories in musical form. Put together of composites, of conversations I heard, things I saw in movies, newspapers, books, whatever, and comes out as stories. That's it. There's no more. __EOS__  Down on Cypress Avenue with the child-like visions leaping into view. The clicking clacking of the high-heeled shoe, Ford and Fitzroy and Madame George… __EOS__ Perhaps it's better that way — better that ""Astral Weeks"" is up for grabs, unburdened by biographical details, better that it remains what Greil Marcus calls a common language. ",2
51209," Yeah, I think that that's, the latter is the case. You make your case and then you follow out your orders with a great deal of obedience and a can-do sort of attitude. But as Gen. Greg Newbold pointed out, you know, he said I didn't push back hard enough. And I think this is true with some of  other generals. They could have pushed back harder than they did. For example... __EOS__ Let me, so when the Joint Chiefs Chairman, Peter Pace, says, We had then and have every opportunity now to speak our minds, that's true? __EOS__ Well, yes, theoretically it's true, but then there are a lot of impediments to speaking your mind.  __EOS__ Well, well help us understand...

51210," Well, it's real in your head. __EOS__ I guess so. I don't know. Yeah, maybe I'm - maybe he is real and I'm not. I don't know. __EOS__ Well, you're the evil genius that created him. __EOS__ I hope that I'm not evil. I hope… ",0

There's always joy in the blues because that's      what--that's where the blues is all right about--you know, I used to have      someone who meant the whole world to me but who left me for someone      else... __EOS__  Yeah.

51212," You tell a very moving story at the end of this book about a student of yours who passed away. And she had handwritten a big project for your class, and when you learned of her death, you dug up that paper. Can you describe that story? What did you see on those pages?__EOS__ Well, this was, I mean, it was a very sad occasion, but it was a precious thing to have. It was hundreds of pages of her thoughts, her stories, her poems, her observations. And what was there - she was a very kind of exuberant person, and that kind of exuberance is always very difficult to capture after someone's died. You'd have to say, well, there's this photograph of her or, oh, I remember this evening. It was brilliant. I can't remember the details. But there it was in her handwriting. It was sort of messy and spilling over and full of loops in odd places and underlinings. And when she had thought of something really brilliant, you could see her pressing harder on the paper. It was all there really, all her personality in the way that she'd set about it. And it was so wonderful because there was nothing kind of premeditated about it. It was just like catching somebody in the act of their personality, if you like.__EOS__ Philip Hensher's new book is called ""The Missing Ink."" He joined us from the BBC in London. Philip, thank you so much.__EOS__ That's a great pleasure.",0
51213," Thank you.__EOS__ I can actually empathize with what these kids went through. I, myself, grew up on a Navajo reservation near Shiprock, New Mexico. And, you know, my regrets have been the fact that I have brothers and sisters who never really knew who I really was because I left for college, because our age differences were so different. But at the same time, I could see my future, and I could see what it is I wanted to do with my life.__EOS__ Thomas Martinez, I wonder if you - you must have some insight into that, too.__EOS__ Yeah. I mean, like all of us, you know, like we're obligated to family. And in the Navajo culture, there's a really big sense of family, and it's always a big family. You're not just leaving a brother or a sister. You know, you're leaving like you have a really big, like intermediate family. So leaving sometimes, you know, you feel guilty, you know, to leave little ones behind, ones that look up to you, one that you've been there for most of your life for the past 18 years, and now you're about to leave.",1

And has a great sense of humor and a great cultural reference point, and I always feel culturally illiterate whenever I'm near him because no matter who we're talking to - I think we were - there was a journalist we were speaking to who I think was Hungarian and had been there.

You used that word stage parents. __EOS__ Man, you don't know my background. See, my philosophy is had Beyonce or Solange came to me and said Dad, I want to be a doctor.

No one can lift the damn thing. It's full of charts and facts and figures, and instructions for dancing. But I, I love it when you read to me... __EOS__ How do you think that your voice has changed? __EOS__ Well, I think it's lowered itself. I think the older you get, the more gravity gains. And you gain a couple of notes at the bottom and you lose a couple at the top. But, you know, if I listen to people like Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits that I love, or Johnny Cash, they do wonderful things with what they're given at that age.

51235," Yeah. Well, that place is very special to me. It really, truly was my childhood dream. And like I said before, you know, a lot of beauty, you know, love and pain goes into their first loves. And it was tough sometimes, too, and it can be frustrating when you don't get your pieces on or, you know, things get cut at the last minute or you, you know, you flubbed a line. And, I mean, I still remember the lines I flubbed. And when you do them live and...__EOS__ Such as? Yeah?__EOS__ I remember in the national anthem, there was a line that always made Kenan laugh when I was rehearsing it. And I used to say - and I'd always say it for him, because it tickled him. And I would say, instead of singing gave proof to the night, I would say   Gave a little bit of proof.__EOS__ And I'm such a, like a - I don't know. I got really nutty about it, and I overshot it. And I just said   Gave a little proof. And just the fact that I didn't say bit of still haunts me to this day. It's really stupid.",3
51236," Hi. Thank you so much. Lisa, first of all, it is an unbelievable pleasure to talk to you. And I don't - sometimes I don't think actors realize, like I'm an actor and more importantly I'm an improviser. And I just want to thank you because in kind of the formative years of being an actor, you were in my living room every Thursday night and it shaped my sense of humor a little bit. So first, I wanted to thank you. __EOS__ Oh, thank you. That's nice. __EOS__ I kind of was curious. I know you're a trained improviser as well. And I feel like we're kind of just starting to get our do a little bit because we're able to improvise sometimes work that is as funny as some scripted things. And I wondered if you think more of that is going to happen now. __EOS__ Yeah. I'm not sure. I mean, you know, let's see. Financially, it cuts down, unfortunately, on a writing staff, you know, for shows. You know, Larry David does that. Christopher Guest, all those fantastic movies, you know, are improvised. I don't know. I think, you know, there's still so much merit to a crafted script, you know, to a story that - you know, they're still very necessary. They really - you know, it really is. ",1
51237," Well, Paul McCartney, it's been an honor to help build up your ego here in this session...__EOS__ You've done it well.__EOS__ ...on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, and helped restore some self-confidence to you.__EOS__ And we greatly appreciate your coming in.",2
51238," ...and they're these German soft-core porn scores.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ And, apparently, he had a reputation outside of that. But they asked him to do these movies, and he kept doing more of them. And it's this really odd music.__EOS__ You know what it is...",2
51239, I just imagine. __EOS__ You imagine that she did? __EOS__ I imagine she did. __EOS__ Okay. ,2
51240," Yeah. He was born in the States and lived in the States until he was - I guess after he went to the Marines and had his, you know, his eyes opened to the artistic side of life. He went to Toronto and got a job after not working for many years, with the National Film Board. And yeah, that was - I mean, at the time animation was really big in the world and there was lots of going over to Yugoslavia and people, international - and Montreal or Canada was kind of a hub of that because of the National Film Board and the tons of people that were animating and making these exquisite movies. And yeah, the Health and Welfare Canada hired him a lot. He's such a friendly cute guy, Terry. He was adorable. He's a little smaller than me and I would walk with him, my whole life people thought he was Santa Claus. Little kids would just say Santa Claus.__EOS__ So did you grow up with a lot of the ""Sesame Street"" songs?__EOS__ I loved ""Sesame Street."" And actually, Terry, I had the chance to skip school and go do voices for ""Sesame Street.""__EOS__ No, really? I didn't know that.",2
51241," No.__EOS__ You didn't think  I'm hurting people's career, people worked really hard on this movie, they're probably decent human beings? This represents...__EOS__ I had that test come up.__EOS__ ...this is a heartfelt effort, even though the product isn't very good?",1
51242," And Russian. And from what I can tell, these are languages in which you're quite comfortable. __EOS__ Well, do you... __EOS__ Or did you trick me? __EOS__ Let's pretend. That's all fantasy of the cinema. Lovely, lovely thought. I mean, I'm very often working outside my own language. I mean, occasionally I impersonated American people and I feel when I'm impersonating Americans that Im outside of my own language, too. I would imagine I would only feel really at ease in my own language if I was playing mute, which I most love. That's my favorite is to make silent films. ",1
51243," Today, I'd like to pay tribute to Gwendolyn Brooks. When I met her in the spring of 1980, I was in awe of her. She was, after all, the Gwendolyn Brooks - a legendary poet and the first African-American to have won a Pulitzer. But she soon put me at ease with her sparkling eyes, her laughter, and her way of lifting her chin delightedly as she reminisced about the poetic and political actions of the late '60s and the camaraderie she shared with other younger poets of the time. __EOS__ The young poets that I met then had as a motto  Black poetry is poetry written by blacks about blacks to blacks. And we went out in the park and recited our poetry, and we went to the city jail. And the most exciting thing we did was to just walk into a tavern, some seven or eight of us, and someone like Haki Mahubuti would say  Look folks, we got a life of poetry on you. __EOS__ Over time, they'd listen to that a lot more. Gwendolyn Brooks became a strong voice for black identity, for liberation from the kind of self-doubt lurking in those young pool players. And her poems became increasingly urgent, with phrases like  Conduct your blooming in the noise and whip of the whirlwind. __EOS__ Vit was really named Virly, and she was so full of life, so full of grit and spice and daring that it was hard to imagine her really leaving. So this is my impression as I attended her funeral, when her casket was being carried out. ""The Rites for Cousin Vit."" ",0
51244,"  This is Ruby. __EOS__  Ruby? It's a lovely name. Very pleased to meet you, Howard Moon. Don't get up. __EOS__  Nice, isn't she? Can I help you in any way? __EOS__  Yeah. I was just wondering if you would both would care to join me and Milky Joe this evening for a night cap. ",3
51245," I mean, I wouldn't call it miserable. I just think that, you know, over the past five or six years in particular, I've watched a lot of my friends make that profound and enormous transition to parenting. And when you're out of sync with your peer group - as I have been, since I don't have children - you definitely do experience, I guess, a mourning, in a way, of what your friendship was before. Because you do lose your friends for a bit, and they don't have the time for you and you miss them.__EOS__ The movie is very talky, and it's very rich in conversations. And let's play a scene where your character's friends, played by Maya Rudolph and Chris O'Dowd, they have several children by this time.__EOS__ And they're arguing, actually, about this decision by their friends to forgo marriage.__EOS__  Why are you so upset?",1
51246," Thanks.__EOS__ And that's you hitting the high notes, Dallas Green, isn't it?__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ Yes, it is.",2
51247," And I was going to follow that up. I was going to say it's a romantic notion, but it's hard, isn't it?__EOS__ Right. Well, it's easier when you can get your expenses down to the bare minimum. My rent in the American Gothic House is $250 a month.__EOS__ Throughout the book, you say - and it's really your mantra - that pie makes the world a better place. How has it made your world a better place?__EOS__ Right. Well, pie is synonymous with Iowa, like I said before, and I live in this little town and there was no pie there, so I opened a pie stand in my house and so now pie is this thing where people can come to the American Gothic House and they go to the little museum visitor center next door and it's all free. Free costumes you can dress up in, but bonus. You can also get a slice of pie, so it's fun to see people's faces light up when they go, whoa. You're selling pie? That's great.",0
51248," Yeah, there was actually - there is a product called Google Moderator, which I have used to solicit ideas and get people to vote on them. This is a public product available for everyone. And there was also  service.com, which I used to conduct surveys. And that website ended up knowing that, you know, a couple of guys have done it as a small startup from probably their house because they don't have an office, I'm not sure. But that just shows you the power of technology.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Wael Ghonim, and he is the person who organized the Facebook page that helped launch the Egyptian revolution. Now he's written a memoir, which is called ""Revolution 2.0."" Let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Wael Ghonim, and he was the curator of the Facebook page that helped launch the Egyptian revolution. Now he's written a memoir called ""Revolution 2.0."" So one of the early Facebook postings that you did on the website that you created, We are all Khaled Said, was after the Tunisian vegetable cart operator set himself on fire in protest, and then the president of Tunisia apologized to the public.__EOS__ For the first time since the day I was born, I saw an Arab president pleading with his people, apologizing, saying now I understand you, I am sorry, I made a mistake. I will not amend the constitution to re-elect myself. I will lift the ban on the media.",0
51249," Meaning, like a blue mold? __EOS__ Blue mold. __EOS__ Yeah, sure. I used to think you made a cheese and you shot it up like, you know, injected it with mold. __EOS__ Right. ",0
51250," So he used to do the ranking impersonation of Frank Sinatra.  __EOS__ Yeah, and the only - I think the only Sinatra approved impersonation. But he really loved my style and the way I played. So he actually started hiring me to play for his shows, which is a variety, comedy and music show. And we just became really close over the years and, you know, good friends. And he helps me out whenever he can. So you know, it's only natural to thank him. __EOS__ Yeah. You've got a big engagement coming up in March.  __EOS__ Yes. I'm really excited. I'm going to have my first two-week run at the Algonquin Hotel, the Oak Room. For someone that does what I do, it's one of those milestones in your career and your life. So it's - yeah, it's a big deal. ",2
51251,"  What is it?__EOS__  It's a trifle. It's got all these layers. First, there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, then beef sauteed with peas and onions.__EOS__  And then bananas. And then I just put some whipped cream on top.__EOS__  What was the one right before bananas?",1
51252," Moustaches. Wigs. __EOS__ Fake lashes. __EOS__ Really, really ugly, hideous long red wigs. __EOS__ Along their bike tour, strangers have become friends, inviting the band in for a home-cooked meal or to do laundry and sometimes riding along with The Ditty Bops. ",2
51253," And his answer was so interesting because, you know, Mark Twain, actually objected to the White House dinner, and he was not alone. In the nature of objection, he said that the president had no right to express his personal feelings about race while in the White House, that the White House belonged to everybody and that a president should not speak personally about civil rights.__EOS__ He also had a low opinion of the president. The storm that burst on us must have enthused the circus soul of the little imitation cowboy.__EOS__ Yes, he thought that President Roosevelt was just trying to make a big political noise.__EOS__ It is interesting. These are two people who could not have come from more different backgrounds  the aristocratic son of New York, Theodore Roosevelt, who, well, was a rancher, he lost a lot of money ranching, but nevertheless, a Rough Rider who'd been governor of the state of New York and, of course, a police commissioner before that; and the son of a slave, Booker T. Washington, who brought himself, literally, up from slavery, educated himself and worked his way through school and made Tuskegee from nothing into a major institution.",0
51254,"  You've been in movies, you've done television, you're on      Broadway. Do you have a favorite? __EOS__  My favorite is whatever I'm doing at the moment.  When      you're on a stage, the thing that I'd kind of forgotten about, because      I'd been away for 13 years, is that you've got an audience there, of      course, and there's a palpable kind of feeling, the symbiosis, or some      communal thing that's happening between you and the audience at all      times.  So if I say something, and there's a stillness, that's just as      powerful as this kind of uproarious kind of laughter thing that happens.      And it tells you how hard you have to work to make your point. __EOS__  You played Nat King Cole in a Showtime story, ""The Natalie Cole      Story.""  Is it more difficult to play someone who is--clearly, when you      speak his name, you can see that person and, those old enough, see his      mannerisms and the like? __EOS__  Well, the first thing that you got to get down is   Can      you reasonably be assumed to look like the person at all?  Then you have      to get to the essence of the person.  The thing that gave me a real green      light with that was that I was in an All-Star game and I was sitting next      to Natalie Cole, and I got a call a month, couple of months later, I      can't remember, and she wanted me to play her father.  And I said, `Why?'      And she said, `Because you remind me of my father,' which, you know, was      one of the nicest things that anyone had ever said to me.  So after that,      you can use your imagination. Of course you study, you look at the man's      life, and you just go. ",3
51255," Do you want to talk about getting her physically, the speech?__EOS__ The speech happened first, actually. That's was what was interesting, is that when I was working on it, I actually listened to the vocal patterns before I added the physicality, because sometimes if you just watch videotape, you see the physicality, and you miss the nuance in the speech. So I spent a lot of time just listening.__EOS__ Tell us about the physical transformation. Did you have to have - how did you get to look like her?__EOS__ Yeah. I had an extraordinary hair and makeup team, Elaine Offers and Alan D'Angerio. Elaine was the makeup artist, and Alan was the hairdresser. And we were in a little room, in a little tiny trailer covered with images of Sarah Palin. And the whole process took about two hours every day because, you know, she's considerably darker than I am. So we had to paint out all my freckles, too.",1
51256," The kind of music I had been playing before with a band that we now call Mwandishi Band was - that band and the direction of the music was very far-out, space music, untethered.__EOS__ And I got a little tired of it .__EOS__ You wanted to be tethered?__EOS__ I wanted to do something that was a little more earthy, you know, and the funny thing was I had been listening to people like Sly Stone and James Brown, but playing a music that was very, very far removed from that. So I actually had broken up that band, but I didn't know what I wanted to do from that point on. And so that was one of the things I was chanting for was to recognize a direction I wanted to go in.",2
51257," And E.J., President Obama yesterday, though, said look, I work for the American people, I'm determined to bring the change that the people voted for last November. Is this exactly what he said he would do during the campaign? __EOS__ Short answer is yes. David doesn't realize, yes, the progressive is the new moderate. And I think what you have here with Barack Obama is, he's keeping his campaign promises. And he's put the issue of inequality right square in the middle of the political debate. For 30 years, inequalities between the very rich and everybody else have been growing. David Leonhardt in David's paper, excellent economic writer, spoke of a story, Larry Summers, Mr. Obama's top economic adviser, used to say to explain inequality. __EOS__ I want to get, too, to the tone and the message of the president's address to Congress on Tuesday, his broad appeal for what he called bold action on a wide range of programs. David, you seem to be saying that he's overreaching. He's trying to do too much too fast, too soon. __EOS__ Well, I thought the tone was excellent. When he speaks, he talks about responsibility, and he's tremendously reassuring. That was a magnificent speech Tuesday. But, A, he's got about six propeller heads, as he calls them, in the White House, trying to redesign health care, finance, education - every -half the American economy all at once. I think that's just too much. ",3
51258," Yeah, I think my job is accomplished much better if I'm invisible. In a compassionate way - I don't mean this in a degrading way - but I always thought of myself as a puppeteer, but in a good way. But always, you know, you don't want to see the puppeteer. It takes away from the power of the performance.__EOS__ So imagine, like, doing a documentary on somebody who is one of the most famous people that nobody knows. He's show-business famous. He's famous to the famous and having virtually no photographs with any of these people.__EOS__ And I'm like, dude, a Polaroid? Something.__EOS__  Something.",1
51259," That's great. It must feel very good to actually have had an impact on somebody's life as direct as you've had on his. Is he making a living or is he studying?__EOS__ You know, Norway has a beautiful program for - in Harstad in particular, that they've put him up. They give him a small amount to get by on, a small salary and he's been given school. So he's - before he left Mogadishu he only had about a grade nine equivalent but he's worked his way through high school and he'll actually get some sort of university courses. Last I talked to him, he was helping them out as a translator at the airport because there's actually, you know, quite a few Somali refugees who go there. So he was sort of helping the meet-and-greet team at the airport.__EOS__ You just tell me what you found so remarkable about him in addition to his ability to, you know, withstand the torture that he was subjected to.__EOS__ Well I think what made it so special - and the other boys too - who have, two of them have actually also managed in the time since to get to Nairobi, they're not doing as well because they're suffering there, trying to get by but, you know, he, Ismail was the youngest. And I think what made him so remarkable was that he said no to the Shabab. And I think so often here when we're talking about, you know, al-Qaida proxy groups in various countries, you know, we think about this entire population who is radicalized and believes in the, you know, holy global jihad movement that al-Qaida and bin Laden espouses. And really, a lot of times that's not it at all. And especially in Somalia, it was a matter of survival.",0
51260," Well, I always was scared, as you can tell by the way I describe my mental state in high school. The idea of being in front of people terrified me. That said, I always knew I wanted to be an actor. So in there lies a huge dilemma. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ I remember I did senior skits. That was one thing I did in high school, the only thing. And then when I got to college, you couldn't even minor in theater at Georgetown. There was no theater program. __EOS__ Why? ",1
51261," Really?__EOS__ Yeah. I think...__EOS__ How so?__EOS__ ...I think there was an intentional but subconscious signal I was sending out, like, hey, I'm still a kid. Don't, you know, don't you expect me to be a full adult.",1
51262," So what are indigenous foods or traditional foods for the Ojibwe?__EOS__ Well, the Ojibwe is a really enormous group...__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ ...And it goes all the way through the Great Lakes area into the plains where I grew up. But I can pretty much say that our traditional foods surround berries, manoomin, which is wild rice, maple syrup in the woodland areas and all the game animals that come from that area as well.",0
51263,"  I met a lady in the meads, full beautiful, a fairy's child. Her hair was long, her foot was light and her eyes were wild. __EOS__ That's Ben Whishaw as the poet John Keats in the new movie “Bright Star,” directed by Jane Campion. It's the story of the brief, intense love between Keats and 18-year-old Fanny Brawne, played in the film by Abbie Cornish. __EOS__  I still don't know how to work out a poem. __EOS__  A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not work the lake out. It is a experience beyond thought. ",1
51264," Yeah, that was in some ways a real success story for zoos in that a consortium of American zoos, working through the Smithsonian and the National Zoo, worked with the Brazilian government to reintroduce tamarins that were born into captivity and then reintroduce them back into the wild to try to get that population in the wild back up. And they've had some success there. They still have a problem that the habitat there is being burned and chopped down, but there are other species. __EOS__ Sharon's on the line from Corvallis in Oregon. __EOS__ Yes, hi. I've been listening to your program, and I spent my whole life as an animal health technician, working with veterinarians. And about 10 years ago, I started working for large-bird, parrot-breeding operation. __EOS__ Right. ",0
51265," My guest is Sonja Sohn. We're talking about how her life story relates to her work. On the HBO series ""The Wire,"" she played a cop. After that, she started a community program in East Baltimore called Rewired for Change and she now co-stars in ABC's ""Body of Proof."" You had mentioned earlier that before you were cast in ""The Wire,"" you did slam poetry and you co-wrote and starred in the movie ""Slam.""__EOS__ Oh, my goodness.__EOS__ ...what you were writing and what you were thinking at that earlier phase in your life when you were first starting to perform and to articulate your thoughts?__EOS__ Sure, Terry. I can't say that I will remember an entire poem, but I can give you a little tidbit.",3
51266," What did you learn from her? __EOS__ Oh. You know what Dinah was? Power. Oh my goodness, she was power. Where Ella may be finesse and technique and all of that kind of stuff. And then Lina was sexy and feminine, and Nina, you know, was just bold. Everyone had their own persona, and Dinah was definitely power. And I love that about her. __EOS__ What is the difference for you between singing soul, where you actually want people to, to hear the red clay in your background, and singing jazz, where I imagine the phrasing is entirely different? And while we talk about this, I wonder if we can actually listen to one of the tracks. You choose. You tell us which one and you can talk about the differences. __EOS__ Oh. I love them all. So just put the needle down and go for it. ",2
51267," And are you - would you now consider yourself a professional poker player? __EOS__ No. I wouldn't consider myself a professional poker player. I don't make much as my friends, who are professional poker players. And I would like to get a job in the marketplace, working with people. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. And I wonder, you've obviously played in both venues now. Is it easier to win or play online or in a real cash game, sitting around the table? __EOS__ Generally, in the live games, the players aren't as good. And it's easier to win there. But online, you can play up to six, ten tables at one time. ",3
51268,"   What kind of dog? __EOS__  Dad, it's not important. __EOS__  No, no. No, no, no, no. It is important. Actually, that's very important. It's a German Shorthaired Pointer. You see, it's actually especially important that it's a Pointer, because that's a crucial metaphor. Because in the book, he's sort of a visionary, you know? You know - pointing the way to salvation? __EOS__  Jo loves dogs. Remember Pepper? We had to put him to sleep. ",1
51269," I knew this was going to be a book about reading, and probably since I first published a novel - so my first novel came out close to 10 years ago - I knew I wanted to write such a book. But I thought as a strategy it would be really interesting to describe people in terms of what they read and how they read. I think you can do a lot, like, describing people with their physical characteristics and things like that. But to me, I've always found it to be a much more informative question to ask somebody what they read.__EOS__ Now, he has something unusual happen to him - a very transformative event, which is that a toddler is abandoned in his store.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ And she's abandoned with a note. And I don't know if you could read a little bit of that note to us.",0
51270," Will it ever be safe for these refugees to return to Iraq? __EOS__ Power, Exile and Upheaval in the Middle East."" __EOS__ When I got to Iraq in 2003 - I had been there during the Iran-Iraq war. When you went under Saddam's time, it was practically impossible to talk to Iraqis. It was illegal. They'd have to report. So they just didn't bother. It was too much trouble. __EOS__ Wait, let me just stop you for a second. Why was it becoming impossible to talk to Iraqis in Iraq? ",0
51271," This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. We're talking today about Gallaudet University. The school holds a special place in the deaf community, in the United States and around the world. We had plan to talk with Gallaudet president I. King Jordan this hour, but given the ongoing protest on the campus, he sent his regrets in a statement last night. He said the current situation at Gallaudet requires his full attention and hopes to join us in the future. __EOS__ 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. We never get on as many calls as we'd like, so today we'll launch a comments page after the program. You can find it at npr.org/deafculture. Deaf culture is all one word. We'll take your comments until 5 00 p.m. Eastern Time, so write to us at talk@npr.org. That's the e-mail address. __EOS__ People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement. He's covered Gallaudet for nearly two decades. And let's see if we can get another caller on the line. This is Victor. Victor's calling us from Washington, D.C. __EOS__ Yes, sir. My name is Victor. My wife and I just moved to Gallaudet University this past weekend, and all this broke out on Wednesday, I believe - yesterday. Last night, you know, we had no food in our refrigerator. We had to negotiate our way out with our vehicle. The protestors told us that we would not be allowed back on campus with our vehicle, telling us we had to, you know, walk back to the campus with our bags. I tried to talk to them. I tried to explain our situation. ",3
51272,"  I'm wondering if you would agree with this.  I have often      thought that Wilt Chamberlain didn't always get the due in terms of who      he was as a person.  When you think about Jackie Robinson breaking the      color barrier, you had to have--and Branch Rickey has said this--the      right person in terms of disposition, intellect and confidence.  The same      could be said for Wilt Chamberlain in that he embodied all of these and      really did move himself and this league forward. __EOS__  Well, he certainly did, and he was Goliath.  He used to      say that nobody roots for Goliath.  He just didn't reveal much of his      softer side. A story that one of his teammates shared with me, Paul      Arizin, also a Hall of Fame player, was a teammate for three years with      Wilt, 1959 through '62. Now Arizin was white, was married, significantly      older than Wilt, and so they never really had a meaningful conversation      in three seasons as teammates.  Now all these years later, 1997, the NBA      names its top 50 players of all time. They honor them at the All-Star      Game in Cleveland, and Paul Arizin brings his 16-year-old granddaughter      Stephanie,??? who was suffering from an inoperable brain tumor.  Wilt      Chamberlain found out about this, and he had befriended Stephanie's      father, who was Paul's son, Michael,??? in the locker room all those      years before, so he begins a letter-writing correspondence with young      Stephanie, and in Cleveland, Stephanie's in a wheelchair.  Wilt pushes      her wheelchair around the room, helping her to obtain all the autographs      of the great stars.  And when that night was over in Cleveland, Paul      Arizin was emotional and he said, `You know, Wilt, I'm indebted to you.      I don't know how to thank you.'  And when I talked about it with Paul      much later, I think what he was struggling to say was only now did it      feel truly as if he and Wilt were teammates. __EOS__  When you think about Wilt Chamberlain, outside of the numbers,      100-point game, 50-point average per season, the infamous 20,000 women,      what do you think about? __EOS__  Well, I think of Wilt as the single-most transformative      figure in the game's history.  I think as time goes by, Wilt will      increasingly get his due.  For right now, I think we can find the      shorthand summary of Wilt's life in two numbers   20,000 and 100.  And,      you know, the 20,000, of course, as you say, from his boast late in life      that he'd slept with 20,000 women, but the hundred from this magical      night in Hershey, Pennsylvania.  And needless to say, one number can be      proven and the other can't. ",0
51273," Do you remember walking into the school flanked by National Guardsmen? __EOS__ Yes, I surely do. __EOS__ And… __EOS__ And it actually, it was a good feeling to know that they were there to make sure that we did get into school and to protect us. ",0
51274," It's not published, but it is finished, and one day maybe it'll see the light of day. If not, at least I have assuaged my conscience. __EOS__ Well, that was a very productive deception. __EOS__ I was going to ask  What's the statute of limitations on invading the French embassy? __EOS__ I'm not sure what that is, and that was of some concern to me before I made the phone call. One last little piece of the story, as the emails  there was more than one  went back and forth, and I specifically asked for access to Baron Scarpia's office, the villain in ""Tosca,"" the ambassador's secretary wrote back to me and said, well, they were willing to consider the request, but who was Baron Scarpia, and where is his office? ",0
51275," They're here already. I mean, there's people on the streets wearing costumes, fighting crime right now. And they're fighting crime without superpowers, but, you know, give those guys bionic legs, give them X-ray eyes and wait until you see what happens next. __EOS__ They'll really kick some butt. __EOS__ Yeah.  __EOS__ Well, Grant Morrison tells us we should all go wile away an afternoon reading a comic book. If you want to wile away an afternoon, you can also read his new book ""Supergods  What Masked Vigilantes, Miraculous Mutants, and a Sun God from Smallville Can Teach Us About Being Human."" And it's out in bookstores now. Grant Morrison, thank you so much for being here.  ",0
51276," Well, I mean, this is something that initially - the concern, really, was what am I going to be allowed to say, and are there limits to what I can say? I think everybody's realized that this is absolutely not going to work if there's any form of censorship. __EOS__ And so, it's sort of this impressionistic experience, where you can kind of just write about the things that you're seeing? __EOS__ I think, you know, many of us find airports fascinating. They are, in many ways, the kind of cultural centers of the modern world. They express all the things that make the modern world so strange and horrifying and beautiful and exciting. And they're all about interconnection. They're about technology. They're about our lack of - or loss of contact with nature. They're about consumerism. They're about dreams of travel. All of this comes to life at the airport. These things that could otherwise sound like abstractions become real at the airport. __EOS__ Have you made friends there so far during your week? ",0
51277," Oh, okay. I'll slow down then.__EOS__ You'll slow down.__EOS__ Because I got to get two out of three, right?__EOS__ Yeah, you do.",0
51278," Marc Levinson will talk more with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies in the second half of the show. Levinson is the author of the new book ""The Great A&P and the Struggle for Small Business in America."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. __EOS__ To a modern sensibility, a lot of these notions just seem so brazeningly anticompetitive; the idea that you can tax stores differently depending upon their size or whether they're a chain or not, that you can dictate to suppliers that - the rules under which they can sell. But this had support from some serious minds including, you know, the Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, right? What was his view? __EOS__ The attack on chain stores had a lot of support from a lot of different people. Louis Brandeis, who became a Supreme Court justice in 1916, was one of the early critics of chain stores. And his notion was basically, yes, granted, these chain stores are saving money for the consumer now. OK, but what they're going to do is they're going to put the small merchant out of business and then the chain store will have monopoly power. So it's saving the consumer money in the short run but it's going to monopolize the food trade in the long run and charge higher prices to everyone. ",0
51279," Well, it's implicit between the lines of the book, Neal. I love the notion of moderation, because, as you know, I put about seven or eight profiles of people who have, well, the term is successfully aged. And one of them is Michael DeBakey, the great cardiac surgeon, who used the term to draw in one's horizons. To try to look at the things that you get the most emotional reward out of, the things that you've always wanted to do but you've frittered your energies away in different directions, things that you might be best at, for example, and this is essentially moderation. __EOS__ Roger, thanks very much for the kind words and have a great time on your vacation. __EOS__ Thank you, Neal. __EOS__ Appreciate the call. We're going to talk - we're going to take a short break. We're talking about ""The Art of Aging,"" Sherwin Nuland's latest book, and, it appears, his own philosophy on getting older. 800-989-8255 if you'd like to join the conversation. E-mail us  talk@npr.org. ",0
51280," …something in hear on your head? __EOS__ Now, I just love to sing. I mean - and I don't half sing. I'm not stingy. I give you everything I have, everything. And that's the only way to sing. and I told my choir, that's the only way we're going to win, if we give it all we got. No punks in Patti's choir. __EOS__ But how do you keep that up, though? That energy level? __EOS__ I just do. I'm just an energetic woman, you know, diabetes and all - menopause, I'm still kicking. I'm still moving. You know, I can do this. And my hot sauce has a lot to do with it. ",2
51281," I think maybe we just ended up with a different bunch of fans than we expected. I mean, like, I think if we could have picked at the time - like if I could have known, like, how much that record would have, that song would've informed everyone about the album, to use Mike's word informed, I probably - my choice would have been more to pick, like, a different song to be the main single, like ""Hold It Now"" or ""Slow and Low"" or ""Posse In Effect"" or one of the other cuts. __EOS__ Yeah, we were talking earlier about going from punk to hip-hop. So I don't imagine you had a big, you know, frat-boy audience for your band when you were playing punk. __EOS__ We never did when we were punk and then also when we were playing hip-hop. Like, what we came out of by hooking up with Russell, we actually, we had - we got like a really good education in terms of going on tour and opening up for Run-DMC. Like, we were on a tour opening for Run-DMC, Whodini, LL Cool J. So that was like a completely hip-hop audience. __EOS__ Adam, in those liner notes, you write  By drinking so much beer and acting like sexist, macho jerks, we actually became just that. So did you feel like... ",3
51282," Now, according to his family he apparently completed his conversion to Islam after he was taken hostage. Had he talked about the Islamic faith beforehand? I mean, was this a path that you knew he was already on?__EOS__ That was not a conversation that I had had with him so I can only go on the accounts of others. I do know that, you know, he fell in love with the people there and so it does not surprise me one bit that he jumped headfirst into learning and immersing himself in that culture. He was searching for his place, not just professionally, but I do believe religiously and spiritually and morally, and he would work all day over there on logistics and trying to find resources and connections and people to help and then would spend all night it seemed like, trying to reach back to his friends and network in the United States. Hey guys, I need blankets today. We're trying to get bags of food to give to the refugees or - at one point, I remember he was discussing a solar panel project that he was looking for funding for.__EOS__ When was last time that you saw your friend?__EOS__ I saw him in 2013. It was St. Patrick's Day so March in 2013.",3
51283," Yeah. He's one of those people - and his record ""Born to Run"" is one of those records where no matter what time of year you put it on, it sort of brings you back into that thing where you're out on a summer night and you can do anything. __EOS__  With her killer graces and her secret places that no boy can fill. __EOS__ I think, you know, as we approach the end of summer, I always get that thing of, oh, I've got to grab on to every minute of this great weather and this inspiring air. And then I realize that it's inside these records. __EOS__  That the thunder in your heart at night, when you're kneeling in the dark it says you're never going to leave her. ",2
51284," Oh was it really? __EOS__ Yeah. And so I mean the benefit of that was that my ear was trained first and from very early. __EOS__ Is that the method where they train your ear before they give you the instrument? __EOS__ Well, before they give you notation they train you by ear, you know. ",2
51285, We're not asking for you to rate her.__EOS__ She's a former Miss Alabama. She is a Miss Alabama.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ She's Miss Alabama. So here's the question.,3
51286," Thank you. __EOS__ Describe what happens to oil on its journey as it sort of begins to rise to the top of the ocean. __EOS__ Well, first of all, when it's  pressure, obviously it's compressed, and so it's a little bit more dense. So it floats relatively slowly at first. And then as it rises in the water column, it expands and actually begins to rise to the surface more quickly. But even though we're about 1,000-foot journey, it does have a lot of time to start weathering and breaking down. That mostly occurs when it reaches the surface. __EOS__ What do you think it looks like deep inside the ocean where the leak has spread? ",3
51287," Historians don't know what they're talking about but I'm here to be a historian. __EOS__ Right. Well, it's a paradox that goes way back in American political culture, Terry. There have always been these characters who come forth. I call them the village explainers, right? They are the cracker barrel philosophers who will come along and say look, these experts from Harvard and Yale and Princeton and the Council of Foreign Relations and you name it, the Eastern elite, they are not really interested in educating you. They're interested in themselves. They're interested in deluding you. So I'm going to come along and explain the truth. That is the pose he's taking. He's just in his comic way - semi-comic way he plays the role of professor at once, as you say, absolutely mocking them, you know, with his pipe and his, you know, trying to talk like a professor talks, all of that, but at the same time he's going to, you know, raise the curtain and say here's the truth. And... __EOS__ So - yeah. __EOS__ But I'm not one of those, you know, pencil neck geek historians -progressives, as he puts it, I'm the real thing and I have the facts. ",3
51288," How long have you been studying Jimi Hendrix's life? __EOS__ Well, I was a fan when I was a teenager. I was too young to have seen Jimi Hendrix play live, but I had all the records and I grew my hair in the best version of an afro I could find at the time. And I lived in New York when I was a kid, and I remember going to Electric Ladyland Studios just to sort of touch the wall of the studio, because that was a special place. So… __EOS__ They let you do that sort of thing with your fro, with your raggedy fro? __EOS__ There are fans - if you have a fro and you're a white guy, you can go in that studio and do whatever you want. ",2
51289," I've never seen a circle dance before outside of a Jewish wedding. I've seen many Jewish weddings. __EOS__ Once again, Fred Wesley, Jr. __EOS__ People always dance to this music. __EOS__ Abraham, Inc. will tour Europe this summer. The band's new album is called ""Tweet Tweet."" ",2
51290," Can't wait to see it. __EOS__ No. Can you hear the fear coming right at you from over here? __EOS__ You know, that amazes me so much to think that you have fears. I mean, you master these roles in a way that we can't imagine that you were ever afraid of them. __EOS__ I have to push myself to that real edge of fear, that first day you come to read the script. That can be a bit of a facer. But there's something in me that requires that. ",3
51291," What a beautiful version. Are you already working on your next album, or is it too early for that? __EOS__ See, the ukulele is a pretty portable instrument. So, you know, there's long drives. __EOS__ So you're writing as you drive, writing… __EOS__ Yeah, a lot of inspiration from the road. ",2
51292," Exactly. Very flamenco influenced. __EOS__ Let's see if we can get one more caller in. Let's go to - this is Jason, Jason with us from Salt Lake in Utah. __EOS__ Hey, Neal, Victor, how are you? __EOS__ I'm wonderful, thank you. ",2
51293," No. __EOS__ I get as nervous as the first time I've stepped on stage. That's the only thing that makes me wonder how long I can keep doing this. __EOS__ Yeah. And given that you've been doing it for so long, there must be, I mean, in those moments wondering what the expectations are. __EOS__ I'm just starting to get that down now, Liane. ",2
51294," Not at all. No. I definitely didn't. And the truth is, I mean I don't know that it would've felt that important. I mean we had a pretty happy family and, you know, things were pretty solid and I was, you know, very comfortable in that family, so I can't imagine that beyond the first, you know, maybe year or two, that it would've even really occurred to her that often.__EOS__ I don't know if you're one of those people who like trace their family tree to see like what is my family history. But you know, what you thought your family tree was - if you ever thought about it -  is different blood-wise than you would have initially thought.__EOS__ Yeah. And that is really interesting, and it's funny because it's, you know, my dad, who kind of like encouraged me to, you know, know more about your biological father's family because it sounds so fascinating, I mean they were Russian Jews who fought in the Russian Revolution and, you know, had to escape the Ukraine when the Polish invading armies came, and there's an amazing story there. My dad is kind of like, oh my God, like, you know, your blood is so much more interesting than it was, like you've got to look into, you know, you've got to look into Jewish culture, you've got to look into Russian culture, like this is amazing. And you know, my siblings are, you totally traded up in terms of genes, you traded up.__EOS__ So I mean I've definitely had a lot of encouragement from the family, raised me to be interested in that and to be, you know, inquisitive about. So it's interesting and it is important to a certain extent, and I'm glad to be able to tell, you know, my kids about that. But I'm not sure that it in any way supersedes how important it was in terms of the family I grew up with, and how I was raised, and I think that has ultimately made me who I am more than anything.",1
51295," Our guest is the first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama. The book again, she just mentioned, ""American Grown  The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America."" We'd like to hear from parents and kids today  What's the hard part about eating and living healthier? 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. And let's see if we can start with April, April's on the line with us from Reno.__EOS__ Hi, it's such a pleasure to speak with you. I just have to say that it sounds like you live in my house.__EOS__ I have to say that it's very difficult for me, being a very busy mom and having everybody else that lives in my family be onboard to help the kids eat better. I mean, just even this morning, my - on my way out the door, my mom watches my daughter, she had a cookie as I'm going out the door. I'm like no, you know.__EOS__ Absolutely, April, and, you know, you know my mom lives with us, and she helps with the kids. And I tease her all the time that, you know, I think she thinks I'm the meanest mom on the planet because she thinks the kids should have dessert at every meal. And I remind her  Mom, these are the rules that we had growing up.",0
51296," I mean, I'm very interested in human beings and who's really moving American politics behind the scenes. I think we spend, as reporters, an awful lot of time just describing the front men, the candidates, and they are obviously very important and what they say is important. But frequently, there are all kinds of dynamics beneath the surface that are really moving American politics.__EOS__ Jane Mayer, thank you so much for talking with us.__EOS__ Great to be with you, Terry.__EOS__ Jane Mayer is a staff writer for the New Yorker magazine. Her article ""Bully Pulpit"" about the right-wing Christian radio talk show host Bryan Fischer is in the current edition of the New Yorker. Coming up, rock critic Ken Tucker reviews Patti Smith's new album. This is FRESH AIR.",3
51297," What was it like to have that stage before you even understood what a stage was? __EOS__ Well, I think that's why I had to give it all up in order to understand her and to be her, because it is a totally different mentality. __EOS__ How did you know that you liked acting when you were a child? I mean, you obviously were good at it right from the start. __EOS__ Thank you. ",3
51298," When you were first starting out, what was the reaction of people when you'd show up at the club? Because we should say that you've got these beautiful dreadlocks and all of this gorgeous sort of jewelry, and you look very sort of ethereal. And I don't expect the voice that I hear coming out of here...__EOS__ ...coming out of your very young-looking face.__EOS__ Well, the kind of reaction that I would get depended on what venue I was in. Like sometimes I would be at a more blues-related venue, and they would be like, what is that? That's not blues as we know it down here.__EOS__ And that's what gave me the idea to start calling it something magical, like moonshine roots music because I wanted people to come to the music with just an open mind and just to be like, hey, is it good music? Because if it's good music, then I'll listen to it. And I noticed that every time I played at any venue, people would come up to me after the show, and they would all have a different thing to say. Like some people would be like, that's hillbilly music. Other people would be like, that's blues if I've ever heard it. Other people would be like, man, that was so spiritual and so Gospel. And I'm like, OK, well, how can I really call it anything other than good music if it touched the people and broke their, you know, barrier and got to their heart and moved them emotionally in some way.",2
51299," Good, me, too. Let's hear it. __EOS__  I am a lineman for the county, and I ride the main road searchin' in the sun for another overload. I hear you singin' in the wires, I can hear you thru the whine, and the Wichita lineman is still on the line. __EOS__ Now, you grew up in Oklahoma. Your father was a Baptist minister. How did the church figure into your daily life and into your musical life as a child? __EOS__ It was a totally all-encompassing influence in that when you're the son of a Southern Baptist minister, you are informed at a very early age that you are part and parcel of his ministry and that your behavior reflects on his image in the community and therefore your every movement, your every word. ",2
51300," I think that we as artists, on the best day, open ourselves up to a certain spirit to be inhabited, as it were, not simply to play but to serve as a vessel for both the highest aspirations of our character and the deepest, darkest aspirations as well. And what my comrade, Q, has done here is loan us a piece of his life. He has entrusted us with it and we, as artists, have a tremendous responsibility to interpret that as best, and certainly as honestly, as we possibly can. __EOS__ Mr. Basir also talked about the whole way in which ""Mooz-lum"" portrayed in the media now. And we also see from polling, for example, that a number of people in this country have developed some negative attitudes toward Muslims right now. __EOS__ I think I've always had a sensitivity. When I did the character on Oz, whom I had actually forgotten until you just reminded me, I was beating up a Jewish man as he came out of the synagogue because the Jewish man allegedly shot a young African-American man in his store for allegedly shoplifting. And I refused to wear a kufi in the scene where I beat the man because I refused to do violence as representative of a certain faith, which would've been indicated by his wearing of the kufi. __EOS__ Mr. Basir, this film is timely and theres another clip I'm going to play in just a minute where the emotions that many people have been experiencing over the last few years since 9/11 come into play. I'm going to play that in a minute. But the family relationship really is at the core and the internal conflicts are at the core, but its not all sweetness and light, this is not... ",1
51301," I think that the odds are probably about 50/50, but I'm not sure I'd say that's in the near future. I think it's interesting that after the meeting between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, the prime minister said that this was a problem that would not be solved in weeks or months, but also could not go on for years.__EOS__ And do you think that Israel's goal would be to just stop this nuclear facility, or do you think Israel is trying for regime change?__EOS__ I don't think that with a bombing of the nuclear facilities, if that's the path that Israel ultimately chose to go, that they could bring about regime change. And in fact, I think one of the most interesting features of the debate underway between Washington and Jerusalem, right now, is that the Obama administration has taken the position that if regime change is really Israel's goal in Iran, then the bombing of the facilities would probably be the single most counterproductive step that they could take?__EOS__ Why?",3
51302," Yeah. You know, when you get certain calls, you know, the phone rings in certain ways, and you go  That ring just doesn't sound good.__EOS__ And that was one of those times. And, you know, I was shocked. I knew how much Steve loves ""Porgy and Bess."" He's never shied away from how much - how passionate he is about this particular opera. And, you know, I think he is, you know, he's a genius. He's, you know, one of the great composers of, you know, American musical theater. And I respect his passion. But I know how I feel about this opera. I know how I've always felt about this opera. And I have never had anything but the greatest love and respect for this opera.__EOS__ Did you feel personally betrayed? This could have so damaged the show. Like, you all survived it.__EOS__ Yeah.",3
51303," No, not at all because I think if you come from where I come from, that's immediately understood. You know, I've had the occasional complaint, but the then mayor of Puerto Rico, Felisa Rincon, was very unhappy about the way that Puerto Ricans were represented in the movie. She was not a happy camper. And it - that's a kind of tough thing. Also, the lyrics to ""America"" were changed. Particularly, the verse was really nasty about Puerto Rico in the Broadway production. If you listen to the Broadway version of the verse where she says -  Puerto Rico, my heart's devotion, let us sink back in the ocean. In the original  Puerto Rico, you ugly island, island of tropic diseases. When I got the role, I was so worried and frightened that I would somehow be forced to say those words. And I remember talking to Robert Wise about it and he said, oh, don't worry. We're not going to have those lyrics. But it was very scary for a long time while I was still in rehearsals, what we were going to do about those words.__EOS__ Let's talk about some of your recent television work. It includes this very intense work on the HBO prison series ""Oz,"" where you play Sister Peter Marie…__EOS__ Oh, I loved every moment of it. I felt so privileged to be working with these astonishing actors. And I think that the scandal of that series is that no one was ever even nominated for an Emmy and I know why. I mean, I'm guessing…__EOS__ Why?",3
51304," Yeah. Yeah. Right. Exactly. Just too many people just every day will say something, just a backhanded compliment, or just a flat-out insult and maybe they don't even realize that they think it's something that you've accepted or just, you know, and they'll just hand you a new insecurity, and I would not want to be someone to do that. So I definitely, you know, said hard jokes but I wouldn't say anything about a woman's appearance that I thought might hurt her feelings.__EOS__ Have you said anything at a roast that you've regretted?__EOS__ No. I have not said anything a roast that I've regretted. Yeah. No.__EOS__ You did say one thing about Ryan Dunn from ""Jackass"" after he died...",3
51305," Only a little bit.__EOS__ That's clearly kind of the intention of the system. So before we let you go, we're clearly, kind of, hearing the same philosophical, perspective difference of opinion about the costs and benefits of immigration or whether it's restrictionist or the expansionist, kind of, what or however you see it now. So, Ali, this, you know, the question is, I mean, just strategically reading here, is there enough consensus somewhere to achieve an agreement at the end of this?__EOS__ What's happening right now is completely different from what we saw in 2006 and 2007, when immigration reform was on the docket, if you will, in a comprehensive way. At this point, yes, we have support from Democrats, Latinos, Asians, labor. But at this point, we have incredible support from, the way we put it, those who hold a Bible, wear a badge, or own a business, conservative and moderate faith, law-enforcement, and business leaders across the country, in the middle. I mean, and these are places like Missouri, Idaho, Utah, the Carolinas, where we need conservative voters to provide support for their conservative members, that their energy and commitment to this issue is, you know, like nothing we've ever seen. And that's why we're very confident we're going to see bills move through the House and the Senate and we're going to be at the President's desk this year.__EOS__ Mark?",3
51306," Yes. __EOS__ ...Donald, longtime first violinist with the Cleveland Quartet. __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ Your mother Vivian Hornik Weilerstein, a pianist. So what got you over to cello in the first place? ",2
51307," You, sort of, develop your own mental emotional applause meter - you know what the audience is, sort of, saying.__EOS__ Absolutely. I mean, you can feel it. And I remember the finest moment I think we've had on stage with applause was, we did this concert with the Royal Concertgebouw Symphony Orchestra in Holland. We were super nervous, with this hundred piece orchestra. And we came on stage very nervous, and played a track called ""Berlin Sunrise.""__EOS__  Berlin sunrise. Come down.__EOS__ With a symphony orchestra, which we learned, there wasn't any option of - Fin's decided to do an extra ending, so everybody just jam along. It's really not an option. We finished the track. And then, because in classical music, you don't, kind of, clap after each track, there was a pause of about - I don't know - it felt like a minute but it was probably like, two seconds.",2
51308," Really?__EOS__ Yes. He was 12 years old and I had already had my second dog so the second dog was doing all the - he was doing all the real jobs and I would bring Bud out just to do a search that I would put out for him. But one day he just said no more. You know, I'm done. I'd rather just lay here on the kitchen floor and be a bum.__EOS__ And you were ready for it. You were ready to hear that.__EOS__ No. I was - no. You're never ready to hear that.",3
51309," I did, but, you know, it's a tricky thing. I think it says something that I wouldn't let my kids be actors. Put it that way.__EOS__ Right. Right. So I've got to ask you about the Ben Affleck senator thing.__EOS__ So there's a big rumor of, like, Ben Affleck might be the next senator from Massachusetts to replace John Kerry. And then you did a Facebook message recently saying that no, you weren't running. It's going to be an exciting - exciting to watch, but...__EOS__ Exciting - the other people will be fun.",1
51310," Yeah.__EOS__ That's Christopher Owens. He's formerly of the band Girls, and his first solo album is called ""Lysandre."" It comes out Tuesday. And you can sample a few tracks at our website, nprmusic.org. Christopher Owens, thank you very much for your time. And congratulations.__EOS__ Thank you very much.__EOS__  You were part of me, such a great big part of me. Oh, you were a part of me, but that part of me is gone.",2
51311," You mean personal because it's Barack Obama, personal because he's a black man or personal because he's the black man he is, which is a progressive liberal or whatever.__EOS__ Well, a lot of people say it's about the progressive liberalism. But that may be it to some people. But the fact of the matter is, nobody likes to go there. And I don't like to have to go there. But being the honest person that I am, I read my mail sometimes. And I get reports on the phone calls. And a lot of the reaction to me has got nothing to do with the position I may take. It's got to do with who I am and what I am. And I read the mail. And some of it I've posted up on my wall - I've framed to keep there because it goes back to what I said to my daughter.__EOS__ But you know you also tell this story in the book of how your car - when your car went off the road one day...__EOS__ Yes.",0
51312," And that became, I think, one of the selling points, if you will, of that record. I mean, it had a lot going for it, but that ending certainly was one of them. __EOS__ One more question about ""Close to You."" There's that trumpet break in the middle. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ And that's almost like a signature of Burt Bacharach arrangements. And the trumpeter sounds just like the trumpeter Bacharach used in his recordings from the '60s, which always kind of sounded a little like Herb Alpert. ",2
51313," …those children learn about the rules of linguistics? __EOS__ Well… __EOS__ The rules of language, I mean. __EOS__ What would happen is that their particular dialect of English would change. It's… ",0
51314," Thanks very much. Just since Curve Ball and Shalabi came up, I would be interested if your guests have any opinions about whether or not, rosy opinions about our reception by the Iraqi people and WMD might have been disinformation from Iran. But what I called to ask about, and what really bugs me, is Abu Ghraib really shot our credibility out there, and it seems that we got that really wrong and it should have been really predictable. Psychological studies have proven that in a situation like you have in the prison there, especially in a war zone where the stress is high, you're going to have this sort of problem. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. Bernard Trainor, you actually date the problems at Abu Ghraib post-war back to a decision made before the war, which, it's an obscure bureaucratic flow through chart that the military uses to describe the forces it's going to need afterwards. Secretary Rumsfeld said, well, this is old thinking. We've got to question every assumption in this chart, and canceled it. __EOS__ Well, that extended well beyond the business of Abu Ghraib and the prisoner treatment. One thing you should recognize that when a person is captured, his most dangerous period is when he is captured, because the captor, usually his blood is up, he's very excited and so forth, and he's apt to go after this person. As you go up the chain of custody though, it usually settles down, that's when he is safe. This was not the case here. And we don't know and our book does not go as far as the prison problem. But we do know that the force levels were not sufficient to take care of the post-war period. Not only that, but the force mix was inadequate. Most of the forces that we had out there were combat infantry men. We didn't have enough civil affairs people, didn't have enough military police people, and some of these people that were called up from the National Guard were, some, of questionable quality. And now all of this contributed to the problem in the prison. But beyond that, we're not prepared to make any comment on that because it was outside the ken of the book. __EOS__ Well, Michael Gordon, you do say in the book though that the cancellation of these follow-on forces of this order led to the fact that these forces being called up late and not getting the training they needed. ",0
51315," Hi. __EOS__ I'm so glad that you guys are talking about this because I'm actually in the middle of writing something, and I touch on this subject. It seems to me that if a fellow commits to the idea of commitment, that is - if not the turning point, at least a salient moment in his life with regard to at least acceding to the idea of manhood or becoming a man. __EOS__ Well, let's get specific. Chris, let me ask  Was there a particular moment, or a particular milestone, for you as you were growing up - where you suddenly realized, you know what? I'm a man now. __EOS__ When I became committed to the idea of I want, I want a family, and I have to do whatever it takes in order to put myself in a position to make that happen. And as I told the screener - by the way, thank you for taking my call. ",0
51316," Hausmusik or house music is less a genre than a cultural phenomenon. Ask any member of the Davenport Zither Ensemble like Bodenbender or Don Ockelmann, and they'll tell you that's the real reason they get together every Saturday morning.   __EOS__ The requirement for hausmusik is love of music.   __EOS__ Everybody that had an instrument or knew how to yodel or dance, they'd meet together in people's homes.   __EOS__ And the idea is not perfection, it's to enjoy the music and enjoy the gemutlichkeit, the camaraderie.   ",2
51317," Were you mindful, though, of that line between offending with humor, of finding humor in things that some people take very seriously? Their religion is extremely serious, and they don't see humor in it. __EOS__ Yeah. But I think God gave us senses of humor and we should use them and I know my approach is a reverent one. I'm not throwing jabs. These are real incidences. This is based on a real-life model of Carolyn Briggs and her experience. __EOS__ Her memoir. __EOS__ Her memoir. ",1
51318," Yeah. The most salient example of that is a guy named Michael White. He's this big luggy Wisconsin Midwestern kid who fell in love with cooking and told his mother and father, I want to go to Italy to study food. And, of course, this is more than 10 years ago, they said, you've got to be crazy. __EOS__ And he's not Italian, right? __EOS__ No. He's an Austrian kid. He's an Austrian-born, Southern California chef. He came there in the '70s, cooked strictly nouvelle French cuisine. And then when he opened Spago, because he didn't have much money, he said, well, I just want this to be a really good pizzeria, but I want it to be the kind of pizzas that you could get in Naples, rather than Italian-American, or at least the American pizzas. __EOS__ I have to say those kinds of pizzas make no sense to me. ",0
51319," It's a very, very new name in horror. It's in fact, new to you, right?__EOS__ It's new to me. It's new to me because I published, so far, 10 novels under the name which is Scott Spencer. And I understand that, you know, after you write 10 novels and you publish suddenly something under a different name, there's gonna be, you know, inevitably some curiosity about why did you change your name.__EOS__ And you're afraid that your book ""Endless Love"" and ""Waking the Dead.""__EOS__ Yes, and then finally, Chase Novak stepped forward because he was willing and actually eager to go places in a novel that Scott Spencer just couldn't be able to reach. You know, Scott Spencer's limited, but the fact that he stands on top of, actually, maybe he's buried beneath, this tottering stack of pages he's already written. And Novak had nothing on his mind but this sort of mania to follow the nightmare logic of these thoughts and memories. In other words, Spencer couldn't have written ""Breed."" It was up to Chase Novak.",0
51320," One obvious thing to do is to not pay dividends. This repeats mistakes that were made right before the crisis and all through the crisis, which is allowing banks to pay an amount of money. Just from 2007, until early 2009, and through the worst of the crisis, that was equivalent to half of the amount of the money in TARP that the government had to invest in the banks.__EOS__ Beyond that, what broader things might the banks do to make them more stable?__EOS__ I would like them to build up and maintain their ability to withstand losses to a much, much healthier range, so that we deliver to the public a stable and healthy system that can make loans and can do everything that we need it to do without being so distorted and dangerous.__EOS__ Thank you very much for joining us.",0
51321," How is that possible? __EOS__ Well, a recent research study conducted in the U.K. shows that pregnant women, while they're watching a certain TV show, in fact were affecting the unborn babies. And as they were born - later on, they had a strong preference for this show where in comparison to the group which were not watching this show while the mother was pregnant, that had no effect whatsoever. __EOS__ You write that - that the tiniest things also can make a difference in our perception of a brand, even the sound of the packaging. __EOS__ Yeah. That's right. We know, for example, today, that if you open a cola, the sound generated in fact is so powerful that it generates, at an unconscious level, craving. And that craving, actually, is so important because most people are not watching TV commercials anymore. They're listening to the commercials while they're standing in the kitchen or whatever they're doing. ",0
51322," I thought that was important in this movie, near the beginning, that we set up that these people really mean it. They are singing with body and soul. You know, this is very intense for them. And I think that's one of the reasons that the music just comes over so powerfully. __EOS__ And you know, what's interesting in your film, you talk about what is really the story of families as well. I mean, we've got the Staple Singers and the Ward family, several other different families. This is really an intimate experience at a familial level - the creation of this music, and how it's spread. __EOS__ Well, you know, it's not for nothing that when you go to an African-American church, everybody's calling each other brother and sister. And that's because if you are a good Christian, they are your brothers and sisters. These are the people that want to help you in life. And that's one of the really great things about how Christianity has manifested and becomes part of people's lives because they want to continue these Christian ethics. __EOS__  Can you hear me? I said, I'm leaning on Jesus. ",1
51323," Right, well, you know, I always feel like that's what they pay me for as a director, you know, is to - if you accept the fact - and I do - that the escape for them was extremely harrowing and scary, you know, and it was mostly about getting from where they were to the airport, getting through these checkpoints and getting on this airplane, that that was the story of it.__EOS__ So just one more question about this. As a viewer, whenever I see, like a biopic or historical film, I'm always wondering, like, what am I learning - like what's true and what's false, and what can I trust? Like if I'm - because I think movies that are historical have usually a dual goal. One is to, like, enlighten you about this, like, really interesting story that actually happened, and the other is to entertain you because it's a movie.__EOS__ Unless they say they're journalism, yeah.__EOS__ Right, right. But I mean your movie isn't trying to be journalism. But I walk away, and I wonder, like, how do I know what to believe. Like I walk away thinking, like, now I know really what happened, and a lot of it really is what happened, but some of it isn't what happened. So how do I know which is which?",1
51324,"  What are you doing?__EOS__  I'm sorry. Skinny jeans George. Skinny jeans Harry. Skinny jeans Vinnie. Vinnie lasted for at least two weeks. He was one of the longer ones.__EOS__  I don't like dating. You know that. I don't like dating. I don't like dating.__EOS__  No. Technic - I think, technically...",1
51325," My question for you is - I graduated from Arizona State Universitys Organic Evolution Program in Biology, and we did a lot of studying from the creationist movement, specifically studying guys like Ken Ham, etc. My question is whether you got any resistance from that community in the publishing process of this book? __EOS__ No, not at all. I mean, this is - the creative process is one, sort of  its, I guess, sort of, was the - one of the paradigms of biology. Its a one-way process. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ So, you know, I was taking information in, but it was very specific as to trying to wrap my head around the science so that I could better tell the story. ",0
51326," Thank you. Thank you. It's good to be here. __EOS__ Thank you. Our pleasure. __EOS__ And I gather Jimmy Reed was important to both of you. But I want to begin talking to you about this, Mr. Dykes, and help us understand. You're from Mississippi, I guess, as was Jimmy Reed. What was it like to grow up in Mississippi and first hear Jimmy Reed? __EOS__ Well, being a kid and hearing Jimmy Reed was just like the blueprint for my life, you know. I was thinking if I could play a guitar and get the, you know, the thump going and sing some Jimmy Reed songs, I didn't really identify ""Baby What You Want Me To Do"" and ""Big Boss Man"" with Jimmy Reed at first because I just heard the songs and love the songs. And the more I've searched it out, more of it I found, and the better I liked it. ",2
51327," But there's a down side and one of the down sides is that people can see the struggle with your weight. Why did you decide to lay it all out and in some really excruciating - in some parts - detail, and why now?__EOS__ Well, it seems, for some reason in the last few years, people are really curious about my weight loss and what I've done to keep it off. Whenever I'm, you know, at a public appearance or anything like that, that's usually one of the first questions, right before ""what time do you get up every morning?"" So, you know, I thought, so many people struggle with their weight. You know, I don't want anybody to think, OK. I read this book and I'm going to lose 100 pounds. That's not the case.__EOS__ That is one of the questions I had that you answered in the book, which is that you say that you battled with weight your entire life, but you also say in the book that it really kind of hit you at age 15 when Bill Cosby developed the Fat Albert character and I'm not going to take you through that again. I'm not going to - I'll spare you hearing, hey, hey, hey again.__EOS__ No, no. But - well...",0
51328," And just so I'm clear about this, the cadaver dogs would be trained to, when it smelled - it distinguished the smell of a live soldier from a dead one and then bark when he found a live one?__EOS__ Exactly. I mean, when you think of a huge battlefield strewn with bodies, and many of them were beyond help, but a medic had to quickly find the soldiers who still had some life in them and not waste their time stopping at each body.__EOS__ Other dogs carrying, as you said, medical supplies onto the field. And I love this  terriers that were saddled with packs of cigarettes to cheer up the troops.__EOS__ Yes, I think these were probably the most popular dogs in World War I, the cigarette dogs, and they were often - they used little dogs, these terriers. They were just saddled with packs of cigarettes, and they would wander around among the troops delivering the cigarettes, and I'm sure they were warmly welcomed.",3
51329," And it was delusional, and there's many sources that you cite. Explain a little bit about how you get sources to talk about al-Qaida's decision and, in fact, the fact that we knew that Osama bin Laden was expecting another few cruise missiles, maybe after 9/11, but nothing more than that. __EOS__ Well, Neal, I mean, I drew together a lot of different sources. I mean, some - I talked to people who were affiliates of bin Laden's, sort of had fought alongside him, who were advising him against attacking the United States in the summer of 2000. We also have a number of al-Qaida internal documents which have shown up on the battlefield, have been translated by a variety of different folks and released by the West Point Combating Terrorism Center. __EOS__ We're talking with Peter Bergen about his new book, ""The Longest War."" If you'd like to join the conversation  What do you consider the decisive turning points of that, well, now 10 years - depends on how you count - war with al-Qaida? 800-989-8255.

51330," To literally throw things. Well, I think those moments… __EOS__ It might have been metaphorical too. __EOS__ No, I think in truth, what one would deem to be the sort of ""Rumors"" era with Stevie, Lindsay and Christine and John and myself, I think it's well documented and it's certainly public knowledge that we have been fairly dysfunctional at certain points in our history, and I'm sure one or two things were thrown across the room. __EOS__ Piano? ",2
51331," Exactly. So at this point most of the elements of the Big Bang Theory seem to still hold very well. But the fact that you have a new wrinkle in the story always gives you a new chance to rethink, and people are busy rethinking. So we think that this could be a whole new element of our fundamental theories of particles and forces and it could be a whole new element of our theory of cosmology, how the universe formed and how and why it looks the way it does. But whatever we used to explain those, this new element has to work and preserve everything we've already understood so that we don't lose our theory of cosmology and our theory of physics while we try to understand this. It has to add to this in some sense.__EOS__ Let's hope.__EOS__ That it doesn't contradict everything we thought we knew. Do you worry about that?__EOS__ Well...",3
51332," Be a real man. And they talk about, if you walk your street - walk the streets with your pants way down low, I don't know. Looks like, to me, you're on the down low. Well, this brings up all sorts of layers of race, sexuality and hip-hop. And oddly enough, we have a man who is an expert in all three areas. Mark Anthony Neal is a professor of black popular culture at Duke University, and his most recent book is ""New Black Man  Rethinking Black Masculinity."" __EOS__ Glad to be on this morning. __EOS__ So I'm going to read you a few of these lyrics, okay? __EOS__ Yeah. That's kind of interesting. You know, one of the thing to towards this whole sag in pants thing is that there's a feeling that the hip-hop generation can't be embarrassed even if they may embarrass their parents and their, you know, other elders. And I think what's interesting about that line is that the one thing that always gets that hip-hop generation men are these questions about sexuality. ",2
51333," And, you know, the creatures in the film, you know, like, they're all dressed as humans with, like, you know, suits and ties and dresses, but - and - you know, they have, like, kitchens and living rooms and furniture, but underneath it all, I mean, they're animals. __EOS__ �like, you know, like animals because that's what they are, and it's so funny. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And there's another scene like that I want to play, just to give our listeners a sense of the story. And this is a scene where Mr. Fox, played by George Clooney, is talking to his lawyer, a badger played by Bill Murray. And the lawyer is advising him not to move into a house right near the really mean farmers, who would probably like to kill a fox. So here's that scene. ",1
51334," Absolutely, very important. __EOS__ Let's hear a clip of Dug, the dog, and listen to his voice, and the two main characters are in this, too. And Bob Peterson, one of the writers, is doing the voice of Dug. __EOS__   We have your dog. __EOS__  Whoa. ",1
51335," Yeah. __EOS__ ...a woman who comes to sit on his lap and he's just vaguely annoyed that she's kind of blocking his view of the football player at first. __EOS__ Yeah. Yeah with her, please get your gorgeous naked body out of my way so I can... __EOS__ ...so I can look at the giant guy that's about to pummel me into a coma. ",1
51336," But then we will also know what's in there that can't be cured and can't be treated.__EOS__ Well, exactly right.__EOS__ All right, we're talking with Robert Klitzman, author of ""Am I My Genes?,"" about - we're not just talking about genetic testing. We're talking about the implications of knowing the results and what do you do after that. We're asking for you, if you're living in this experience right now, to call and share with us what your decision-making process is. Our number is 800-989-8255. Our address on email is talk@npr.org. We'll be right back. I'm John Donvan. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.__EOS__ This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm John Donvan. For his new book, Dr. Robert Klitzman interviewed 64 people who underwent genetic testing and learned that they might face Huntington's disease, breast cancer and another illness known as alpha. Many people elect to undergo genetic testing outside of their doctor's care, and then they struggle with whether to divulge what they've learned to their physicians.",0
51337," And first, tell us about revival of ""Private Lives"" that this film is about. Was this theater or was this a celebrity circus - come see Burton and Taylor, onstage arguing with each other.__EOS__ To be honest I think it wasn't, as the character says, creative.__EOS__ But I think she wanted to see him again. But it made commercial sense. She was a canny producer and it was her production company. It is an absolutely perfect piece of theater for them to have done. And they enjoyed working together.__EOS__ There's a wonderful tension in this story between Taylor and Burton - apart from the love affair and the alcohol and the pills - and it's about acting. And I want to play a bit of what Dominic West, as Burton, says about the first scene that they played together. And she's playing Cleopatra.",1
51338," Unintentional. __EOS__ The thing is that when timpani first came into the orchestra they were used mainly just for marshal effects or for festive effects and they were always paired with trumpets. If we just take a quick example, Renee, listen to the very end of Mozart's ""Jupiter Symphony"" - ""Symphony No. 41."" __EOS__ Carrying this forward, how did the timpani get parted from the trumpets? __EOS__ When was the divorce made final? ",2
51339," But that framework doesnt work for me. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ You know, who cares? __EOS__ Mm-hmm. ",1
51340," Right, interesting. Let's talk, you know you mention fashion as it, you know, relates to female MC's. And so you've got rappers like Jene Grey who's respected as an MC but she doesn't go out of her way to flash a lot of flesh. Rappers like Lil' Kim and the recently incarcerated Remy Ma are female MC's and they're always working the skin tight clothes, you know the hot pants, the weaves, all that. So how do you think women who are very overtly sexual are treated differently than women who are not in terms of their fan base or how people relate to them? __EOS__  Right, well let me just say this. I think those particular women who wear the skin tight and the, they do that regardless. Whether they were rapping or not.  __EOS__  No, really. That's who they are. And I think when I came out and I had the baggy jeans and the t-shirt, like I didn't make that up.  We all wore that in Brooklyn. That was the uniform, you know the huge gold earrings that was, I represented every girl from Brooklyn at that point. But I think how we're treated, to me I always wanted to be heard, not just looked at. And I think because the field was so male dominated and I'm on that stage rocking for an audience of guys rather than to have them gawking over me, I wanted them to hear my words.   __EOS__ All right, just quickly, you have a new group, Almost September.  I've heard the stuff on My Space, you haven't dropped an album yet. It sounds good. ",2
51341," Well, I think, again, we did find that in the course of the study - that those who are the predominant age groups, in their 60s, 70s, early 80s, are more progressive or liberal in their attitudes on many things and in their religious practices, whereas these younger people coming in tend to be more conservative. So, it is causing some tensions in some religious communities. __EOS__ Like over what? People argue, you know, and the old days it used to be fighting over music, you know. Turn that stuff down, turn that nonsense down, you know… __EOS__ Well, there's still some of that, too. Right, because now you have the younger people wanting Gregorian chant, and maybe the older people wanting folk music. I don't know what the clash is. But I think it probably is over - some of it over music and different kind of prayer styles. That may be one area. __EOS__ Sister Mary Bendyna is director of the center for Applied Research and the Apostolate at Georgetown University. You can find the study, and learn more about the evolving U.S. Catholic community, on our Web site. Please visit the new npr.org. Just go to programs, and click on TELL ME MORE. Sister Mary, thank you so much for joining us. ",3
51342, But that's Thursday last week time. __EOS__ That's a Thursday last week time. __EOS__ And then you put ... __EOS__ You are harsh. So you would relegate him lifetime achievement to Thursday night. ,0
51343," Well, I think that was actually the beginning of it. This movie was actually shot in a very tight budget with very few days, so we had no rehearsal time. Daniel and I were able to contact and keep some sort of contact with each other going only through contemporary means because he lived in Ireland and I was in Los Angeles. So he doesn't email and in lieu of sending letters, which is the way that Mary and Mr. Lincoln, you know, communicated with each other when they were separated, obviously. And they wrote wonderful letters to each other, rather short and kind of unloving, but that's all right. I could have that.__EOS__ Like his speeches I guess, Lincoln's speeches.__EOS__ So we texted each other in - using the verbiage of the era, which is what he and I were both studying. So it made total sense that we would write kind of letters because I was reading all of Mary's letters and also letters that others had written of the time. And so it was a way for us to start to wrap our minds around the - really the beautiful use of language in the 1800s.__EOS__ So, for example, can you remember a text or a phrase?",1
51344," A Holocaust Story."" Dan Porat joins us from WBEZ in Chicago. Thanks so much for being with us. __EOS__ Thank you for having me. __EOS__ And all these years later, what do we know for certain about that photo? __EOS__ Not much. When we talk about the little boy, the one and only thing we can say definitively about him is that he's in all likelihood younger than 10 years old, because he doesn't have a Star of David on his clothing. What we can say is more about the Germans that are in this picture, primarily about the soldier holding his gun behind the little boy, who is - was arrested after World War II. His name is Josef Blosche. ",0
51345," It was. By 2 o'clock that day, we're now almost 24 hours after the tsunami, TEPCO confirmed that radiation levels had risen around the plant, and for once that was good news, actually. A slight rise in radiation level meant that venting had been successful.__EOS__ All right, so this material was vented. Was there a significant impact of the radiation on the general population of Japan?__EOS__ At that stage no. From the venting, radioactive material was released. It's never a good thing. But it was certainly much, much, much better than the alternative, which is a potentially exploding reactor. So this has happened a few times in the history of nuclear power. Plants have had to vent for safety reasons. It's a very serious and undesirable scenario, but it's not - it doesn't release radiation which is necessarily damaging to health.__EOS__ It was done in Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, wasn't it?",3
51346," Actually, I was aiming for college professors and people of that ilk. __EOS__ See, I always resented the fact that I was in a business that people really looked down on. They  most people thought that comics were either for very young children or semi-literate or perhaps illiterate adults. And it's no fun writing when people have that opinion of the things you're writing or the audience you're writing for. So it was really great when we started increasing - or elaborate our vocabulary and we tried to get some personality in our characters and concentrate on characterization. __EOS__ I spent some time traveling with Minor League Baseball teams and they don't live down to their stereotype either. But I do have to tell you the only person on those buses traveling up and down I-95 who read comic books was me. __EOS__ And let's see if we can get some callers in on the conversation. Our guest is Stan Lee. Let's go first to  this is Jerry, Jerry calling us from Modesto in California. ",0
51347," Yeah. I mean, you're right. When we started, I had this idea, and really I - you know, I took the idea from his memoir because I think one of beautiful things about Roger's memoir is that he's writing about his life from the vantage point of where he is in his life now, when he wrote it, which is he's been through all these cancers. He's lost his ability to speak and eat. And he's looking back on this incredible life he's had and conjuring up the memories of it.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guests are Chaz Ebert, who was married to film critic Roger Ebert for 21 years, and Steve James, who just made a new documentary about Roger Ebert called ""Life Itself."" And of course, Chaz is one of the people featured in the documentary. It was made during the last month of Roger Ebert's life, and it's just been released. Let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, we're talking about the new documentary ""Life Itself,"" which is about the late film critic Roger Ebert.  And with me are Steve James, who made the documentary. He also made ""Hoop Dreams"" and ""The Interrupters."" And Chaz Ebert, who was married to Roger Ebert for 21 years and now is the head of rogerebert.com. And she is keeping his legacy going with, among other things, a website that is filled with movie reviews. Chaz, by the time the film got rolling, he was physically compromised because of the surgeries.__EOS__ Yes.",1
51348," It's usually the survivors, like Ishmael in Moby Dick, who are left to tell the rest of us what really happened.__EOS__  The drama is done. All are departed away. The great shroud of the sea rolls over the Pequod, her crew and Moby Dick. I, only, am escaped, alone, to tell thee.__EOS__ In Sarah Lotz's book, ""The Three,"" the young survivors become the center of a media storm. They're suspected of being aliens or harbingers of the apocalypse.__EOS__ There's something about a miracle. For example, someone surviving an air crash that, to us, makes them extremely special. They've beaten death. That really fascinates us.",0
51349," So what did Topo Gigio lead to?__EOS__ It led to my writing for Phyllis Diller and Bob Newhart. And so I was making a living writing one-liners. And then I began, as I said, to go - then I went to Second City, and then I came back to New York, and I worked in - all over the Village, where I met everybody.__EOS__ It's great that you wrote for Phyllis Diller because one of her things was, like, her husband Fang, and she'd always tell, like, her husband jokes. And you told a lot of husband jokes. So I imagine a lot of her husband jokes were actually yours?__EOS__ But the difference was she made fun of her husband, and if anyone ever listened closely to mine, which they did not - because they'd always say to my husband, Edgar, oh, does she make an idiot of you - I was always the idiot in the joke. You know what I'm saying? I was the one. I came out of the bath who had no breasts. I came out of the bathroom on my wedding night, and he said  Let me help you with the buttons. And I said  I'm naked. So I was the idiot.",0

I'm writing a bunch of short stories, working on a film script for ""Anansi Boys,"" my last novel, my last adult novel, and working on a non-fiction book, my first non-fiction book for about 22 years, which is about China and Chinese myth and the legend of the journey to the West. That's what I'm working on this week. __EOS__ That all sounds fascinating. And after this most recent book, you have to remember to say my most recent book, not my last one. __EOS__ I do.

And before we knew it, we had this whole song structure and then RZA put his vocals on. And then we had an open verse for Pharoahe - and he came on another day. But, yeah, I mean, the song - the whole form and the first verse and the chorus were all done in one day. __EOS__ Most of the emcees would show up around - between 7 00 and 9 00. __EOS__ And they would have to come up with lyrics on the spot, you know, the same way that Pat and I had to come up with the music on the spot.

Pack up your rags and skidoo. I said wait until my Bill comes home. He's my honey from the honeycomb. He'll have money �cuz he told me so this morning. __EOS__ Loudon Wainwright, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Love the CD. It's a pleasure to have you here. So how were you introduced to Charlie Poole's music? __EOS__ In the early �70s, I was - there was a singer-songwriter guy called Patrick Sky who was a friend of mine, and he sang me a little piece of ""Hungry Hash House Blues,"" which had the line  the beefsteak, it was rare, and the butter had red hair. And I was laughing and thinking at the same time, where did that come from? ",2
51354," Yeah. Some of my favorite films are that genre. I mean, I remember seeing ""Platoon"" and just being deeply affected by it. I love ""Deer Hunter,"" Apocalypse Now."" You know, those movies - in terms of generationally, those movies were very important movies because that era was when I was younger, and those are the movies that influenced me a lot. __EOS__ Did you ever try for real to be in one of those war films? __EOS__ I had a meeting with Oliver Stone for ""Platoon."" I think I was, like, 20 or 21. I had a go-see, as they call it. __EOS__ What was that like? ",1

51356," Yeah. And Patricia, I hope that you will - I'm sorry that - I was thinking a lot of things when you were speaking, but, you know, we just - I was just working on the second, the next StoryCorps book, which is called ""Mom,"" and we could have filled that book with interviews that were done between adopted kids and their adoptive or biological parents. So many people come to StoryCorps to have those conversations. __EOS__ Here's an email we have from John in Rocky River, Ohio. Is there a list of starter questions to ask? __EOS__ We have something called a question generator, which not only has starter questions, but hundreds and hundreds of questions. We have what we call our best questions, which through the 30,000 interviews we've done at StoryCorps have proven to be, you know, the 10 most effective questions, and those will get you far. __EOS__ I was going to ask you to email me those questions. I could probably use a few of them. ",3
51357," The way they play here is different. We rehearse like four or five hours per day. That's why you have kids eight years old playing Bach. __EOS__ Director Santiago Lusardi of Argentina says besides a grueling schedule, the 30 members of his orchestra possess an innate talent passed down from earlier generations who first startled Europeans with their musical prowess. __EOS__ In Europe, they really got surprised. They were discussing if they were people or they were animals, but they were playing like people. So that's why they say they can't talk, but they can play like people, so they are people. It's incredible, but it was, it was like… __EOS__ The Choir and Orchestra of the Mission of San Javier, established in 1691, the oldest of the Jesuit of the circuit, they perform beneath an altar alive with rose-cheeked cherubs both ornate and innocent. The composer of this choral work is anonymous. The language is Guarani. ",2
51358," That's your job.__EOS__ Does it pick up where ""School Daze"" left off in some ways? I know I remember that kind of Spike Lee had kind of a stab at this. Or there was another film earlier about the kind of the - you know what I mean? There have been kind of attempts before at a comment on that kind of observation. Is this - does this take us into a new place?__EOS__ It does. And I think that it's very conscious of its legacy as being part of this on this cinematic continuum of films about race set at colleges. And this one is set at an Ivy League school. John Singleton's ""Higher Learning,"" for instance, was set at a university school. Spike Lee's was set at an all-black college. This is set at a kind of Ivy League school. And the thing that's sort of interesting to me and the thing I like so much about it is that it is equally contemptuous of everybody, and everybody is guilty of something. All the black, white - well, it's mostly black and white. But at some point, the Hispanics and Asians at least get lip service to being involved in the big race riot that happens toward the end. And I think...__EOS__ Oh, spoiler. There's a race riot.",3
51359," It's the kind of twist that makes Asgar Farhadi a master storyteller, says Columbia University's Hamid Dabashi. He teaches literature and Iranian studies.__EOS__ His cinema is just like an onion. You peel one layer and there's another layer fresh, ready for you. You think, well, that's it and then yet another layer is opened.__EOS__ Like his last film ""A Separation,"" Asgar Farhadi's ""The Past"" is about domestic conflicts. It's about the fractures between husbands and wives, between parents and children. And it's about the way the past casts shadows on those relationships.__EOS__  When I'm watching a movie, I don't like to watch a movie that the director is trying to give me all the answers. Or kind of some cinema that seems a bit preachy to me. I like to participate in cinema and to be interactive. And I think the only way to create that situation is to create questions for the audience to be able to participate.",1
51360," All right. So in general, in the body politic, there wasn't great support for integration and for reconstruction in the South. But you also write about intellectual currents, which affected the thinking of the educated and legal scholars, in particular Darwinism and its application to social relations. What - explain what was going on. __EOS__ What happened was a number of thinkers took Darwin's theory of natural selection, which as most people know, is a slow process of individual mutation, and applied it to society as a whole. __EOS__ If you were doing well in society, it was because you deserved to do well, you were more fit. If you were doing poorly, it was because you deserved to do poorly. __EOS__ Lawrence Goldstone's new book is called ""Inherently Unequal."" He'll be back in the second half of the show.

51362," Yeah. She was watching a firefight, and she got captured along with other journalists. There was a group of them, and we all despaired of this because people were getting captured right and left in Cambodia. And most of the journalists who were taken prisoner or taken hostage in Cambodia never came back alive. And it was kind of miracle, really, that Kate survived that, particularly since United Press International, her own company, filed a story - and the reason I know this is that it was in the New York Times - which had described a body being found. It was believed to be that of Kate Webb. And they had her picture and all this detail. It was practically an obituary. And then about a week later or whatever, she suddenly pops up alive. And everybody went, what? __EOS__ She was - you cannot go through what she went through and come out unscathed. She described herself, though, as a maybe tough exterior, but a softy inside. And she said maybe you have to be a softy to do this for a long time. If you're a hard person, well, hard people are brittle and they break. __EOS__ Well, I had read that quote. I never heard her say that myself. But I think that that really does, in a way, sum up the kind of thing that you might hear from Kate Webb if you leaned forward at a table. __EOS__ She also said when she retired, I guess that she was getting too old to be on the frontlines of journalism, and that's the only kind of reporting she wanted to do.

51363," So for example, Chinese engineers and Hungarian engineers would most likely choose to speak with one another in English, but would have a vocabulary that perhaps is not recognizable to those of us who don't know engineering so - including, perhaps, myself. So I might not understand their English and yet they would be speaking definitely a version of English.__EOS__ Well, yes. But I mean, if an Australian engineer and a Scottish engineer get together and talk engineering, you wouldn't understand them either. I mean, the issue is partly of a field jargon of a special constituted branch of the language for talking about specific things and unless you're part of that field, you don't really know what's going on. But yeah, I mean, I should say, the dialectal varieties of international English are often impenetrable to other dialectal varieties.__EOS__ I want to bring in some callers now. We've been asking you if you have experienced being lost in translation, and I want to go to Monica in Milford, Indiana. Monica, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.__EOS__ Hi. I have an interesting fact about translation. I married an Amish man and I was actually Amish for 12 years. I wasn't raised that way. The language was very hard to learn because it's kind of a slang language. But something that I picked up on, being that I wasn't raised like that, it amazed me. When you hear an Amish person say a word with the ending Uh, it always - as in the English translation ends with I-N-G, ing. That's why when you hear an Amish person speak, they have such an accent because they don't practice that distinct ing.",0
51364," It used to be toxic and disastrous for me, but now, it's something that is really motivational for me, because I've found another network of friends who are also in recovery. And with my Web page, I talk to girls every day about how wonderful life can be. It's really something that kind of keeps me going now, and to be able to go on and talk to people who can understand how tough it is to recover from this disease is really helpful. __EOS__ Your site, in some ways, seems almost like a mirror reflection of what you find on some of the pro-ana sites. There are things like quotes and motivation. And one of the sections there is the religion section. Can you talk a little bit about what that section's about? __EOS__ Sure. One of the big things that pro-ana sites have is the religion section. They talk about the ana creed and the prayer to ana and actually make anorexia, I guess, a sort of religion. I went under and kind of made it more of like a self-affirmation-type thing, a creed, basically. __EOS__ So, for example, the pro-ana sites, you know, one of their rules might be that food makes you fat, and you counter that by saying food makes you healthy, not fat.

Why could someone not take them some water in? How could they not get pictures out? ",1
51367," There are all sorts of rumors about their helping, or taking credit occasionally, for bringing me down. My view is I brought myself down, and I will not try to blame others or excuse my behavior. I did what I did and shame on me. If they were involved in unearthing it, okay. So be it. That isn't my concern right now. __EOS__ That's Eliot Spitzer from the film ""Client 9  The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer"" by our guest Alex Gibney. __EOS__ Well, I think he said it. I mean I think the point is that that's why this is a kind of a Greek tragedy. This is a guy who had a fatal flaw, who was beset by his enemies, but at the end of the day falls because of that fatal flaw. And really he has no one to blame but himself. So we can talk about a lot of the irregularities in terms of the federal investigation, we can talk about the fact that his enemies pursued him and wanted to take him out, but at the end of the day, the only person that Eliot Spitzer has to blame for his downfall is himself. __EOS__ Well, Alex Gibney, thanks so much for speaking with us.

If you're not in jail, if you're not unemployed and you're trying to do something positive, you are, you got a lot going on and you have to be able to communicate. Men now are made to feel in a lot of ways like we can't, you know, there's no strength in, you know, being sensitive or just have feelings. You know, like I have children, you know, I have to be a teacher and I have to be kind and understand where they're coming from and talk to them at a point where they can understand yet, firm to let them know where the boundaries are, you know.

You wanted to retire, you didn't want to retire. But, then in 2006, you retired. It was over. And so, three years into that retirement, how does it feel to not be a professional tennis player? __EOS__ It feels like a good fit. You know, it was a seamless transition for me. You know, again from that day that I lied about taking the drug, you know, that was the day that I was asking for a second chance and got it, and most people don't get that. And I made a commitment to myself and I made a commitment to all those around me and - that I would make the most of my second chance, that I would atone for this part of my life in a way that will be real every day. __EOS__ The school is a school that you founded and have helped fund, a charter school for inner-city kids, yeah.

I'm a different person. Becoming a mom was what I needed to refocus my attention. Magic glasses, I would call them.

Myer's new documentary about Gordon is called ""Supermensch.""__EOS__ Yeah, every time. My job was to be honest. And this is how I made my living. But I knew I would hurt them. And especially when you become friendly, which didn't happen with every client, but when they become your friend, you know, when I saw Alice, having, going through his alcoholism, that was so painful. And I knew I was a big part of it. But I was honest with him, and, you know, he could've maybe gotten it through someone else who wouldn't have cared. And then the pain could really hurt. So I just, you know, I made excuses to myself for how I made a living, and tried to do as honorably as I could. But I can't say that I'm proud of, you know. If I had a rewrite history, I'd love to get that part of what I did for my life out of the way, but it, they go hand-in-hand. If you make someone famous, they have to pay a price.__EOS__ Did you pay any of the prices of fame, even though your name wasn't famous, but you were constantly surrounded by famous people, people who you helped make famous?__EOS__ No. I think my, i think most of my pain was probably self-inflicted, in that I use my work as an excuse to not have to deal with my personal life. It became a very easy way to not have a life, and not have to deal with all those big issues that having a life can bring.",1
51372," As I talk about in Considering Genius, Charlie Parker became a hero to me because my father, who had been a drug addict during World War II, told me that once he was in San Francisco and he went to hear Charlie Parker play. There were these two women who sat in the audience and they were so enthralled by Parker's playing that they didn't go to the bathroom. They wet their seats rather than to get up and miss one note that came out of his saxophone. __EOS__ So being a kid that entranced me and then I started reading about him. He was a gifted as this kind of superhuman dissipater and this extraordinary genius and great virtuoso. __EOS__ When you read the essays and the writing, you get a sense of the intricacies of many of these men who played this music. But what is it about jazz, particularly in a certain period, Stanley, that you believe speaks to A) the American heart so well, and B) the complexity of life? It seems to me that it is not just a myth that this music was so complex. __EOS__ Well, the first thing is that I think it's perfect for America because most of all the jazz player has to develop an individual sound and style and also has to be able to play with other people and as an improviser, which means that he or she has to be able to make his or her notes fit in with the group. So that means that the improvisation connects it to a democratic way of making music. ",0

51383," You know, you've made the point in the book and in a lot of places that when so little information is provided, it invites speculation among journalists and others to fill in gaps. And, you know, one could look at these developments and see petty corruption, and, you know, you've said, you know, people get favors, jobs as favor, parking places, or you could - it could be that there's massive financial corruption, you know, waste in the millions; or people shaking down others for jobs, or promotions, or intimidating people or bribing people.__EOS__ Well, I'm not privy, of course, to the various financial misdoings that are going on, but I have followed some of them. You know, to me it was shocking to hear when an archbishop who really was a whistleblower in the Vatican City governor's office revealed that when he came to his job, he discovered that the Vatican was paying almost three-quarters of a million dollars every year to erect its nativity scene in St. Peter's Square. Obviously, an inflated contract.__EOS__ the contracts are given to friends, the contracts are inflated. You know, I don't see anything that would probably come onto the radar of high officials because it's kept at a low level. And I think with the agency that Benedict set up, I think it's going to be much harder to do that kind of thing.__EOS__ That archbishop who discovered that contract, that was Carlo Maria Vigano, right, and then he was transferred out of the Vatican then, wasn't he?",0
51384," Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, you know? __EOS__ That confirms something for me. You know, I'm surprised how many times an artist that you pay attention to, and you go back to hear their earliest work, how fully formed some people arrive. And when Mose recites that verse, it sounds like he wrote his first song with his point of view completely intact. And I always find that really fascinating how often people sort of walk through the door initially and, you know, they've already got the uniform on. __EOS__ Well, Joe Henry and Mose Allison, it's great talking to you. Thanks so much. __EOS__ Thank you. ",2
51385," Here's an email we have from Mark in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas  When my wife entered hospice care after battling cancer for nine months, I had complete confidence in the organization's competence. What I learned was that hospice organizations experience the same challenges as other organizations. When my wife asked to be admitted to the resident hospice facility, the nurse told us it was not time for that yet and she would be discharged as soon as a doctor examined her. Less than 24 hours later, after I pleaded tearfully with the hospice team leader to admit her, my wife died in the ambulance on the way to the facility. __EOS__ They are being presented as alternatives more often, but I must say not often enough and Larry mentioned that it is important to say that some of these decisions and some of the actions of physicians are done through love and caring and emotion. But very often, physicians are also kind of acting out of defensiveness and fear at the same time and one would hope that our medical schools and the hospital teaching units would be able to introduce to the doctors. The doctors have more power than anybody else, perhaps, in a hospital atmosphere. __EOS__ Let's go next to Mark with us from Wichita. __EOS__ Hi. ",0
51386," Well, I don't have any problem with the reading with them because I love to read. I don't look at it as a chore. The newspaper comes in the door everyday and most of them, you know, look at some part of the paper and that's good. That's good. They, you know, like the sports section, whatever. I don't care. I don't care if they're just reading the comics as long as they're reading something. And I think that my attitude about reading probably helps them be good readers and not look as reading as a negative.__EOS__ Okay.__EOS__ But, you know, it's just not my thing. But the thing is that one size really doesn't fit all with kids. And if less fortunate kids do need these great programs, families that are able to provide for their kids, they really shouldn't be penalized. I would hate it if you took summer away from my kids because we - well, summer vacation. You never take summer away. God knows, it's been hot. But, you know, I just like to be able to have them do something else and have them be bored for a little while and try out something new on their own.__EOS__ Let me ask our other two guests about that idea because, Ron, during the school year, a lot of us have this sort of model of school is work for kids. You know, we teach them to take it seriously, to say this is your work. It's your job to go to school and to learn. What about during the summer? What do you think makes sense as a way to carry the learning forward? Or should there be an effort to say, well, it's actually fun?",3
51387," Hello, Neal. How are you today? __EOS__ I'm well. Kate Webb worked for your archrivals, the United Press International. __EOS__ That's correct. And it was arch rivalry. In those days, the Vietnam War was one of the last two stories in which AP and United Press International went head to head on a daily basis, the other one being the space program. That was before UPI essentially disappeared later on. But at that time, during the war, we had a real hot rivalry going, and Kate Webb was a key figure in that. __EOS__ Tell us a little bit about what she was like. ",3
51388," You know, when I went to summer camp, we were taught archery, bow and arrow.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ And riflery.__EOS__ Sure. The .22. I mean, you probably can still smell the...",0
51389," So you're probably like, the first generation to have that as an option to get started.__EOS__ It's true. Yeah, that was my big break; my first big, paying gig. I was so proud of that. I remember before I got that commercial, I just prayed to the heavens that if I could just be on television and the kids from school could see me, that would be the answer to all my prayers and I wouldn't need anything more. And I went on the auditions, and I got the part in the Activision commercial. It was, you know, for the Atari 2600, the original home video game system. It was for a game called ""Pitfall."" And I remember all the lines still, to this day. I was only 13 years old, but it was  Just last night I was lost in the jungle with Pitfall Harry, surrounded by giant scorpions and cobra rattlers.__EOS__ Bravo.__EOS__ It's so weird how my lines - some things just stick with you.",1
51390, That's it.__EOS__ Go for it.__EOS__ Philip Galanes writes the Social Q's column for the New York Times. Harriette Cole writes the nationally syndicated advice column Sense and Sensitivity. Both were kind enough to join us from NPR's bureau in New York. Thank you both so much. Happy Thanksgiving to you both.__EOS__ Happy Thanksgiving.,3
51391,"  Abby, I'm trying to help you.__EOS__  Really? By judging me on my appearance and the way I talk? And what's the difference between me using my sexuality, and you using those glasses to look smart?__EOS__  I am smart. I placed out of freshman German.__EOS__  Or Lutz, using that sexy English accent to get me in the sack.",0
51392," What will you perform? __EOS__ I think there's only aria to pick really because it's a real finale aria - it's going to be ""Nessun Dorma"" again. I've been doing some work with some of the very good coaches on the show and hopefully, you know, it will be even better. __EOS__ If you win, will you go back to being a cell phone salesman? __EOS__ I don't think so. I don't think so.  you know, the reactions that I've been getting, nobody's expecting me back. ",2
51393," Well, we needed those songs to help us not to be fearful when we were doing marches or doing picket lines. And you needed a calming agent, and that's what those songs were for us.__EOS__ The march itself that we are commemorating today, that was not fearful, was it? What was your feeling being there? That wasn't a fearful time. What was that feeling?__EOS__ You know, I've never been afraid. My dad, who was a minister - his name was Reverend I.A. Harris - he taught us never to fear any man and to always think that you are as good as anybody else, but you're no better than anybody else. And on marches, I wasn't afraid because I knew who was by my side. Walk with me Lord.__EOS__ Do you feel now that music has the same power to inspire?",3
51394," All in their hearts they're saying, if we could just go back there, America would be right. Right for who?__EOS__ Not for blacks, not for women, not for Native Americans, he says, only for white men.__EOS__ None of the founders were necessarily interested in promoting a specifically Christian nation. Many of the Founders believed in something akin to separating church and state, even though they didn't use those terms. And in fact, most of the people in America were not regular church-goers. So what is that great culture that we are returning to?__EOS__ So I'm not trying to throw the nation back 200 years.",3
51395," Katrina. The storm became Hurricane Katrina and its devastation along the Gulf Coast changed the way that many Americans lived and forced many people to change the way that they think.__EOS__ There's the door. A shirtless drunk is passed out in front of it - then a bar, then another door. It doesn't look promising.__EOS__ The stairwell is even less promising  dark, decrepit.__EOS__ Then on the third floor, a door opens to a space seemingly the size of a bowling alley. An assault of color leaps off the walls, oranges, blues and greens. Pillars are painted in fantastic designs. The chandeliers are draped - no, covered - with gold Mardi Gras beads. The far wall - could be 100 feet away - is lined with books - mysteries, mostly, many of them written by the woman whose home this is, Julie Smith.",0
51396," You probably entered the rock world more.__EOS__ Absolutely. I was - I became queen diva of the background rock world.__EOS__ So suddenly you were probably in this world of, like, white rock singers who were looking for a gospel-tinged sound in their background.__EOS__ That's it, that's it.",2
51397," Thanks. __EOS__ So it's a pleasure to get to speak to you. I have a chronic disease. I'm 59 years old and I was diagnosed at about the age of 47 with multiple sclerosis. And I actually had onset of symptoms beginning about two years prior to that. And I had always been an extremely active person, watched my diet, walked 35 miles a week, did aerobics, did yoga, did qigong. I mean, you know, the whole gamut - weight lifting. __EOS__ Well, you know, one of the things I did in the book was deliberately seek out people who had taken some very hard hits. __EOS__ I immediately think of Patricia Neal in this kind of discussion. ",0
51398," Right. I got an assignment from a magazine to go to Belize, talk to people on the ground and find out what was happening down there. Nobody would tell me anything. There were rumors. You know, people had heard things, but nobody would go on record.__EOS__ Come out to my house. You can stay here. I'll send a boat to fetch you.__EOS__ And at this point, you don't really know what to believe from this guy.__EOS__ I don't know what to believe. I go back home. I write up my report. The story gets published in Gizmodo. And then three days later, I get an email from police officials, saying that McAfee's neighbor has been murdered. McAfee is nowhere to be found, and he is the prime suspect.",3
51399," Let's take a look at charter schools, another example of a type of school that you changed your mind about. So let's start with an explanation of what charter schools are and how they were started. __EOS__ Well, charter schools originally were the idea of Albert Shanker, who was the president for many years of the American Federation of Teachers, which is a teachers union. __EOS__ Let us start a small school, with your permission, and we will go out into the streets, recruit the kids who dropped out, recruit the kids who are about to drop out, and let us see what we can do to come up with ideas that will help make public education better. And it'll be a collaborative venture. __EOS__ How does a charter school turn parent against parent, teacher against teacher, in your opinion? ",0
51400," He says that men in army uniforms took him to a courtyard, stripped him to his shorts, beat him and more. __EOS__ In addition to this, a soldier and an officer who jumped up in the air and gonged down on his head with his leg. __EOS__ So you say they used a whip, they used a stick. __EOS__ Yes. ",2
51401," It sounds like this torch is still dimly burning. __EOS__ Well, listen. I believe that all torches are inextinguishable to some degree, no matter human beings say about that subject. And I just do believe that once that fire is kindled, it lasts forever. You do love that person forever. __EOS__ Well, I think this would be a good time to hear the Glen Campbell of ""By the Time I Get To Phoenix,"" written by my guest, Jimmy Webb. __EOS__  By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising. She'll find the note I left hanging on her door. She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving 'cause I've left that girl so many times before. ",2
51402," I know you love action films. Were you ever the victim of the action in junior high? Were you beaten up? __EOS__ No, no I was, well by that time I was a pretty tough guy, so I... __EOS__ Were you really? __EOS__ I didn't, I wasn't a predator. I didn't pick on other people all right, but people didn't beat me up. ",1
51403," I remember you talking about you breaking your thumb. What happened to your foot?__EOS__ Well, OK, this is what happened to my foot. I was in Kansas. There's a scene in ""Bruno"" where I am wearing S&M gear, and I'm chained up to my boyfriend, and he has a toilet brush in his mouth that is kind of strapped there. And anyway, we're chained up together. We were shooting it in this hotel room, and we, like, called up room service.__EOS__ Do you mind, you know, can you give us the room service? Do you mind unchaining us?__EOS__ All right, let's go, come on, everybody out, everybody out. And me and my co-star start running down the corridor, and we went towards the elevator, and we've got - you know, we always have like an escape car waiting, you know, a getaway car. It's like any good heist.",1
51404," Well, let me ask you about the people you had in this movie. I mean, you had some really superstar actors.__EOS__ I really credit the power of Superman himself, because I think every one of these actors - Kevin Costner, Diane Lane...__EOS__  Dusty!__EOS__  Mrs. Kent? I'm Lois Lane from the Daily Planet and I'd like to talk to you about your son.",1
51405," Were you familiar with that approach to hair? Did you... __EOS__ I never, never used it. I mean I just thought, no. It's got to be in the cut. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ From '54 to '63, when I went into my own first salon, I just said we're not doing any of that old stuff anymore. It's very pretty and nice, but we're going to stick our guns. ",1
51406," Yeah. __EOS__ ...because sometimes they're written exactly like that. It's like one cliche after another and sometimes... __EOS__ Yeah, it's ridiculous. __EOS__ It's ridiculous, I know. And there's always things blowing up and there's always that Carmina Burana kind of music behind it. ",1
51407," You know, I think a lot of what they're doing is about sound.__EOS__ Bryce Dessner produced the recorded collaboration between father and son.__EOS__ Pedro has an incredible sound. His guitar sound is just spectacular. Gaspar, his sense of what he's doing is, you know, I mean, half the time it's, you know, he might be playing one note but you're hearing four just based on his use of overtones. He has a very developed sense of the right hand with his bow.__EOS__ Pedro Soler says that today, most flamenco has become what he calls nice music.",2
51408," You also talked, Alicia, that you were all very close, and so the lines of communications were open.__EOS__ Absolutely. My platoon was very, very close and we stuck by each other no matter what.__EOS__ Can you talk to us, Alicia - when you started to feel that - wait, I might have something called PTSD. Something's just not right. And I guess this must have happened in interactions with your family members and your neighbors and coworkers.__EOS__ Well, my situation is a little bit different since when I was deployed, I was actually in Germany and I deployed from Germany, so when I returned home, quote-unquote, I didn't return back to the States. I didn't return to my family. I returned to Germany, where I had really nobody other than my other platoon-mates, so they kind of all understood.",1
51409,"  Thank you. __EOS__  Yeah, I wanted to thank you, too. __EOS__  We're going to take a short break now.  And if you'd like to join      our conversation with Amartya Sen--he's the winner of the Nobel Prize in      economics--you'll be--many of you will be pleased to find out that      there's very little economics in this book, ""The Argumentative Indian       Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity.""

51410," Enormously popular support in Israel. I think that the polls, now we're talking about Israeli Jews - Israeli-Arabs didn't feel this way - but the 85 percent of the country that's Jewish has been more than 90 percent throughout the war in favor of this.  __EOS__ The press was barred by Israel from going into Gaza during the actual war in Gaza.  And the director of the Israeli government press office was quoted as saying, ""Any journalist who enters Gaza becomes a fig leaf and front for the Hamas terror organization, and I see no reason why we should help with that.""  As a journalist, what was your reaction to that, and to being barred during the war from going into Gaza? __EOS__  I was really outraged, and in fact, I was personally quite vocal about it.  I spoke to Danny Seaman, the director of the government press office.  I personally complained to everybody I could, and I'm a member of the foreign press association in Israel, and we, as an organization, first tried to get the various ministries to help us, and then ultimately, went to the supreme court and asked them to force the government to let us in.   __EOS__ You told an incredible story about one of your colleagues, Taghreed El-Khodary, who lives in Gaza and has been reporting from Gaza for the New York Times, and her reports were just essential during the period that Israel was barring reporters from going in.  She was already there... ",3
51411,"  It's a good thought.__EOS__  It won't play.__EOS__  As a non-professional, I think it's an excellent idea. Excuse me. Un-dramatic, perhaps, but practical.__EOS__  Happy little housewife.",1
51412," Oh, you were learning, OK, yeah. __EOS__ I was, kind of love it. I was - or maybe also he was learning, who knows?  And so I think, you know, he might, you know, when he hears it again in a few years it might sound familiar. __EOS__ Mr. Ponti, thanks so much for your time. __EOS__ Thank you, thank you. It was a pleasure. ",2
51413," Right. Is there - in this character Constance in ""Alphinland"" - I just wonder reading about her in this world that she's created, is it a fear for a writer like yourself who has done so much writing that, in a way, you become trapped by what you've created?__EOS__ How old are you?__EOS__ I'm 44.__EOS__ Oh, do you feel trapped by anything yet?",0
51414," Hans Zimmer, can you tell us briefly what you're working on now? __EOS__ I am working with my good friend Jim Brooks on his new movie. And, yes, I'm sitting there with a blank piece of paper in front of me... __EOS__ ...so it's terrifying. It really, you know, it really is, because I don't quite know where the music comes from. So you don't quite know if somebody's going to turn off the tap or something like that. So every time when I'm at the beginning of a project, it's a little hard on everybody around me as well, because I turn into this, you know, neurotic thing that doesn't think he knows what he's doing and doesn't know how to write anymore. And, you know, the tunes are actually quite hard-earned. You know, there's a lot of sweat and late nights that goes on. __EOS__ Hans Zimmer, we hope you'll figure it out. Good luck with it. ",2
51415," Yeah, that's true. I mean, it becomes a kind of world philosophy, and it seemed to me at the time, for all of its intelligence, a slightly nihilistic one. And anyway, I was kind of on the fence. I enjoyed studying semiotics, and I learned a lot about it, but I was conflicted. So I put a lot of these conflicts into Madeline, who is even more traditional in her literary taste than I was, but who's also attracted by semiotics and the hipness of this new creed that's coming to America in the late '70s. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. It did. I mean, when I got to Brown, the place was riven, because you had older professors who were basically new critics and had been teaching a certain way for 30 years. And then you had this other gang who was down with the semiotic program. And as a student, you were, in a way, forced to choose which cohort you were going with. And finally, the professors from the English Department decamped and started the program in semiotic studies that went on to be called something else now. __EOS__ So what stuck with you about that? I mean, do you still read literature looking for tropes and signs and so on? __EOS__ Not so much signs and tropes, but I'm aware of cliches and I'm aware of experiments that have been done and I'm aware of a kind of deadness to a lot of realism both in the language and in the structure of a book. And it's something I, you know, fight against and also have had to accommodate myself to, because I still am someone who wants to write narrative fiction and even realistic fiction. ",3
51416," It was 2003 when his album ""Twentysomething"" came out. __EOS__  I don't want to get up just in the light. Leave me alone, I'm a 20-something. __EOS__ Since then, he's sold over four million records, been nominated for a Grammy and two Golden Globes. Jamie Cullen is now 30-something -just - and he's here to talk about his latest album, ""The Pursuit."" __EOS__  I'm sorry to say I didn't know her name. In fact, the last six hours are a haze. We sang together the fragments of a frame, why my motor skills are out of phase. ",2
51417," Well, how in the hell did these get under your bed?  __EOS__  I don't know, I don't know, but Malcolm would never cheat on me. Especially not with, this is like four yards of lace. A woman this big, wearing a thong? That can't be comfortable.  __EOS__ All right, Nia, this one's in the can. What can we look forward to upcoming from Nia Long? __EOS__ I am headed back to L.A. to direct a video with Yolanda Adams and I'm really excited about that.  ",3
51418," I'm wearing a new black skirt and a top I bought in Seattle a few months ago. And my favorite pair of shoes - they're coppertone, and that's about a three-inch heel with the nice little pattern on them. I was model - standing around looking in the mirror and this woman in her early 20s comes by  those shoes are killer. I said, really? She said, yeah, you got to buy those.  __EOS__ So you did. __EOS__ She talked me into them and now I wear them all the time. __EOS__ Those kind of moments are pretty fun though. ",3
51419,"  There ain't no trick to get rich quick. Dig, dig, dig with a shovel and a pick. Dig, dig, dig -__EOS__ No, those aren the - I've gone back and looked at the lyrics and those are the lyrics. __EOS__ They're the same. __EOS__ Yeah, those are the lyrics, actually. ",2
51420," Come away with an opinion? __EOS__ No, no, and I think that it's very, very important to realize that the waste emanating from nuclear power, this time span of consequence is something new to mankind, and it was as such, as this phenomenon, something new for us, all of us, that was my initial interest. __EOS__ Do you think that scientists will find a way? __EOS__ Well, the scientists in the film, they say themselves that there are no solutions to nuclear waste. ",1
51421," Thank you so much. __EOS__ And I have to note that you begin your book not with a story about your childhood and your youth and your mother, but about the discovery as a young attorney of a boy named Jeff locked in a basement of a foster care facility in Alabama. __EOS__ That's right. I began it with one of the very first cases that I worked on right out of law school. It was a very old case, a case that had been decided a number of years ago, actually decades before that, by Judge Frank Johnson in Alabama. This involved the rights of people in psychiatric facilities and in mental retardation centers across the center - across the state rather - and I was assigned to represent kids. And I found a boy who had been locked in the basement of this facility for days, as was a common practice. And it was a very important memory for me and one that I would never ever forget. __EOS__ That experience, though, of being locked in a dark basement, that's something that happened to you too. ",0
51422,"  Where it can used as evidence? __EOS__  Right, which was dumb because the cops came seconds after we left.  My girlfriend was like, what's going on?  I said, ah, nothing, nothing.  We left in her mother's car, a 77 Ford Granada that did not move. And about two minutes later, there were a bunch of - like a SWAT team,  an armed robbery call went out, and we just missed that and they found the note and gave it to the judge, and he read it back to me a million times.  Yeah, that was dumb. __EOS__  So, your sentence was? __EOS__  I spent a couple of nights in the clink there, and then so my sentence was the - it got reduced to a disorderly conduct. They ended up believing that I was only kidding.  And the headline in a local paper, bank robbery was only a joke, the headline's actually in the book, we were able to find it.  And it got dropped to like a disorderly conduct, so I got time served, $500 in court fee, and I had to do 25 hours community service. ",0
51423," And it's sort of that slippery slope of cloning that, you know, that rages into today. __EOS__ And artificial intelligence. Roy is the replicant in the movie - he's played by Rutger Hauer - and he finally gets to meet the man who designed him. This is a man named Eldon Tyrell. Let's listen to this clip. __EOS__  It's not an easy thing to meet your maker. I mean, what can he do for you? Can the maker repair what he makes? __EOS__  Would you like to be modified? ",0
51424," Yes. I - that was exactly what it was. And to Good2cu's father's credit, he understood. He didn't necessarily approve but realized that his son had developed his dreams sitting on the couch watching the World Series of Poker with him. And to sort of make his case, Good2cu showed his father all of the meticulous records he had kept on his poker playing.__EOS__ He had spreadsheets, like, showing how much he was winning and losing every day with each game, his strategies, how many games he could play at the same time. I mean, he was running this like a business playing online poker.__EOS__ That's exactly right. What sort of united all of these kids is that they all treated poker like a business. When they talked about winning at the poker table, they didn't talk about it in terms of, hey, I won this much today, but in terms of return on investment. If I invest this much time and this much money into a game, I can expect to see this kind of rate of return on that particular investment.__EOS__ And, you know, if they had been 30, 35, 40 years old, they would have been sober, smart businessmen, but they were not. They were 18, 19, 20 years old making a ton of money, and they acted like adolescents. True?",0

The mom's exhausted. She's flipping channels alone in her living room when she sees a grainy, silent film with a monster looking back - the Babadook.__EOS__ Well, you know, I wanted it to look low-fi and more handmade. And I think it's more savage that way.__EOS__ The best effects, says scholar Caetlin Benson-Allott, might just be the movie's young star.__EOS__ I think the director did such a good job finding a creepy child. .",1
51426," I appreciate the phone call. Let's go to Andy. Andy is calling from Portland, Oregon. __EOS__ Hi, Neal. Thanks for taking my call. Barbara, I'd be interested in you expanding a little bit on what you were just talking about. One of the places that I've found that the spontaneous expression of joy really is being preserved is in places like the rave dance culture, and the Burning Man culture, that have really grown to prominence in the last 10 to 15 years. __EOS__ Yeah. I think that's terrific. I haven't been to the Burning Man Festival. I really - I have to go some time -__EOS__ I highly recommend it. ",0
51427," 1973 for this movie. __EOS__ No, I don't know. I just - you know, I figured I was playing the action guy in it, so I - and I wasn't going to get any taller.

51428," Absolutely. Absolutely. It's so easy, again, to look back and say, well, you know, all the things that the isolationists said were wrong. And, in fact, most of them were.

51429," You have a character, Bootie, who is an outsider. He comes into this world, this Manhattan literary world, and tries to take down this literary lion Murray Thwaite. And he has really memorable line after witnessing the World Trade Center attacks. He says it was an awesome, a fearful thought. You could make something inside your head as huge and devastating as this and spill it out into reality, make it really happen. You could for evil, but if for evil, then why not for good, too? Change the world. __EOS__ Mm hmm. __EOS__ Do you have that kind of - albeit cautious - optimism? __EOS__ I don't - you know, I'm so un-in touch with my dark side in truth in my life so, so I don't know if I have - if I'm a raging optimist in general, but it did seem a thought. You know, why couldn't there be something positive that could affect the world as much and what would it be? ",0
51430," He only has one foot.__EOS__ He had a prosthetic and he vowed that he would play soccer once he got a better prosthetic, which he has been given in Norway and he's running again. But one of his greatest concerns on that flight was he said, what do I do during Ramadan? I'm going to starve because how would he break the fast if there was sun, you know, the sun never went down? So we explained to him that he wouldn't starve and I think that the Muslim community there had figured it out. But, no, he's a remarkable kid and he's doing really well. And it's so rare in journalism that you actually, you know, see impact from something you write. And this was, you know, just one kid but it meant a lot.__EOS__ What language is he speaking now and how do you communicate with him?__EOS__ Well, we're Facebook friends and he does well on Facebook.

That's right. And for that matter, when I was in - when I sort of embedded myself from the House of Representatives in 2011 while working on a book, I heard far less talk about how can we work together to achieve a solution, and far more talk about how can I get my map redrawn so that I get the voters I want and I basically won't have to take tough votes? And so I think redistricting has really created a perverse mentality that has undercut, you know, a lot of the intentions of a representative democracy.__EOS__ Robert Draper writes about congressional redistricting in the current issue of The Atlantic.__EOS__ We're speaking with veteran political journalist Robert Draper. He has a piece in The Atlantic about congressional redistricting.",0

They fail with monkeys, horses and dogs before succeeding with chickens. __EOS__  The hens, besides being easily procured and costing little both as an initial investment and for their subsequent maintenance, are capable of making rapid and definitive decisions. They stick scrupulously to the prescribed mental programs, and, given their cold, calm nature and their evanescent memory, they are not subject to distractions. __EOS__ Politics were a constant thread in Primo Levi's life and work. __EOS__ In 1970, he complained on Italian television that modern Italians were oblivious to the strings of fascism that still existed in the country, what he called the consecration of the privilege of inequality.

Yes. What's interesting about this change is that, actually, it was predicted, pretty much at the beginning, dueling sort of begins to take off actually around about Shakespeare's time. You remember the duels in ""Romeo and Juliette."" __EOS__ Sure. __EOS__ I mean, those are part of a practice that's being replaced by the duel, because you remember in ""Romeo and Juliette,"" the Montagues and the Capulets have these sort of street brawls between young men.

If they've been living with fear and shame, and then it's really going to hit the fan.__EOS__ You kind of said that in fewer words when you accepted the Oscar because you thanked your two children, and you said something to the effect that you didn't want fear or shame to inhibit them from being, like, the special people that they are.

I think that fantasy at its best is emotionally realistic, but      not--the same way that, like, a cartoon that I'll draw does not look like      a photograph, because my feeling is if you want something photographic,      just take a photograph. __EOS__  Mm-hmm. __EOS__  In the same way that when you're doing work that is this      romantic or this tragic or this over the top, you want to use its power.

He's shunned the romantic or heroic leads in favor of morally ambiguous and often complex characters.__EOS__ But I do admire his great dedication to our country and I do admire the genius that he had in creating a fingerprint system in our country and using modern forensics and restructuring this bureau in a way that was incredibly necessary in our country at that time. It was a much different time than we know of today. I think that, if there was sympathy or empathy to have, that the audience may have with him, it's in the understanding of his motivations, not necessarily the results.__EOS__ The film focuses quite a bit on the relationship between Hoover and his assistant, Clyde Tolson.

51447," I could have very possibly been delusional, but this new schedule, unlike SNL, every day at SNL is wildly different, like Mondays are so different than Wednesdays, and the whole week is sort of this teakettle boiling with the release coming, obviously Saturday at 11 30. And everyone who works there feels like they're, to some degree, inside this teakettle, and that pressure really gets to you and I think wears you down. And everybody who works at SNL looks, like, 10 years older than they are. The makeup hides that come Saturday, but trust me, if you see us at Tuesday night in the hallway, it's a bunch of ghosts and zombies. So this new job, because you get the release of doing a show every night, as well as the fact that, you know, we're not doing the show at 12 30, we're doing the show at 6 30, you finish the show, actually I'm getting home at like 8 30 or 9 o'clock, which is a fairly human time to walk in the door. And I've found the schedule, you know, a lot more amenable to having a healthier existence.__EOS__ So let's talk about figuring out what your version of ""Late Night"" would be. One of the things you actually had to figure out was how to walk out.__EOS__ You can't believe how hard that is.__EOS__ No, I can believe it.",3
51448," So what's some of the advice that the famous self-help author was giving to the self-help authors and would-be self authors who had paid to attend the seminar - the kind of advice that was moving them to tears?__EOS__ A lot of it was just inspirational stories. He told the story of how he had come to be a self-help author. And the classic narrative of an inspirational story is that somebody starts from a very low place - you know, they've lost their job, they have no friends, everybody they knew has died. I mean, sometimes it's really that extreme. And then they have an idea, and they put in some hard work, and then they achieve an amazing goal. And I think that in a way we're really hard-wired to respond to that kind of story. We just project ourselves into that situation, and it just immediately makes you feel hopeful about your own potential and your own situation. So I think that just by telling us the story of his success, everybody got really excited about the idea that they could replicate that success.__EOS__ Really, people were so horrified by that idea - that he sold it for no money on the condition that he could play the lead. And then he said, like literally, at the end of the story, did you know that David fought Goliath with only one stone? So he literally went from one inspirational story to another one that we are all familiar with. And people just got - they were just getting so excited and so pumped up by hearing, you know, oh my god, it's Rocky, it's Sylvester Stallone, but, like, he started out with nothing and it could have gone so wrong. And I think this kind of thing just really made people feel very hopeful about what they could achieve.__EOS__ So this gets to exactly what one of the things that makes me uncomfortable about self-help. It takes the person who is the exception that proves the rule and makes the exception that proves the rule, the rule. In other words, like, this person had an exceptional experience. They wrote something with no experience, everybody turned them down and then they had this huge success - which means that you can do that, too. But the point is, what makes that story exceptional is that very few people who get turned down finally get accepted like that. You know, it's not the typical story; it's unlikely it's going to happen to you.",0

Indeed, it was a history of them lying to your adoptive parents, lying to you, until they finally came clean. __EOS__ Correct. In fact, in 1983, there was a law that, a New York state law that legislated that all adoption agencies in the state had to reveal all medical information to adoptees and adoptive families.

It was 1968, so that's 40 years, and I was fortunate enough to go with Horace Silver that very first time.  So I got to travel quite a few places.  And what I came to understand over a period of time, going back and forth with different groups, is that Europe is very much a horn culture.   __EOS__  Really?   __EOS__  Yeah.  Every little nook and cranny, and most of the towns you go to, they got a little oompa band, they got some trumpets and saxophones and clarinets.  And so I discovered that most of the people who were in the audience at one point or another had studied music.

What are - some advice that you would offer to couples who are experiencing this, and also to the people who love them and care about them and want to do right by them? __EOS__ Well, for the couples who've experienced this, I would say embrace it, as hard as that may be. Love your baby forever. Cherish those mementos. Talk about it even if people are uncomfortable because in order for us to heal, we must grieve. __EOS__ Alan, what about you? Did you - were there things that you needed, that you and your wife needed, that you felt, in a way, you had to fight with people about? __EOS__ The one thing that I could tell friends and relatives of people who've suffered a stillbirth is just to extend your arm. Just say, I'm there. Just say, I'm there. Whenever you're ready, I'm there. Don't try to force yourself on them. Don't try to say, well, maybe I should step away, maybe I shouldn't do this.

51455," It does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy. And I think that is a function of the fact that some of these institutions have become too large.__EOS__ That startling comment may be news in Washington, where regulators gave a thumbs-up last week to nearly all the big banks, based on a stress-test of their ability to withstand a crisis. The attorney general's explanation is no surprise, though, to Stanford financial economist Anat Admati. She is coauthor of a new book called ""The Bankers' New Clothes.""__EOS__ People are saying that the banks are too large, but the issue is really  Why would there be this negative effect on the world economy if he prosecutes them? And that's because they would somehow fail or get distressed. And why does that happen? That happens when you borrow too much. So it's not about too big to fail, but it's about the likelihood of failing, which is the likelihood of being somehow having difficulty paying your debt, just like homeowners might when they have very little down-payment or equity in their house.__EOS__ One thing, speaking of regular folks, I mean, it had not really occurred to me, but you point out that of the debt that banks carry - and they carry about 97, 98 percent debt - say my savings account is basically a loan to the bank, a loan that I can take back at any time.",0

But I've talked to African-American families in recent years who expressed some wistfulness. They say that not all of the results of integrated education have been strong or positive in this country. __EOS__ Absolutely.  Matilda's sister Mary is a really interesting example of a way of thinking about what is lost and what is gained. She was not integrated until her senior year in high school. I'd like to hear what Matilda says about that. __EOS__ You know, when I hear my sister talk about the bond that the young people, the teenagers had at that age, the fun things that they liked to do, they've become accustomed to doing those things, and then to be uprooted and separated, even though perhaps the education was more up to date, they felt they were taken from the group of students that they knew and the bond that had formed between them had been torn apart, which was different from me because I was so young. __EOS__ Thank you so much, both of you, for speaking with us.

We sort of looked back at our first four albums and went, right, what is it about these albums that we like? Well, we loved the - it was more electronic than we sort of became.

The exit row was a few rows ahead of me. I had to go forward. I think some of passengers might have gone to the rear doors. And I initially got off and we were standing on the left wing, and that was kind of getting overcrowded, people were going into the water so I went out back up into the right front of the plane. So I had to go back into the plane and then got on a raft on the right side of the front of the aircraft.  And at that point, I looked back and just the pilot and the attendants were on the plane, and it looked like everyone had gotten off which I was very grateful for at that point.  __EOS__ I'm trying to image what the scene must have been like inside that plane as people are trying to get out.

And it was the director of that film, Roman Polanski, who approached you. How did you end up cutting her hair before ""Rosemary's Baby""? __EOS__ An interesting story. He wanted my balcony in London. I said, what do you want it for? He said I'm photographing Catherine Deneuve on the balcony, they're filming - ""Repulsion"" it was. And instead of staying for two days, as he promised, he stayed for a week. Well, our clients loved it. They were there on the ground floor, he's on the balcony and he didn't mind the noise. It was all part of the excitement, he didn't need quiet. So we just all carried on with our work and eventually he left. __EOS__ So he called and said would I come to Hollywood and cut Mia Farrow for ""Rosemary's Baby.""

51483," Well, the way the system works in Iraq is the way the system works in many parliamentary countries where he who wins the plurality of seats doesn't necessarily turn that plurality into a majority. And indeed, that was Allawi's problem, because he won 91 seats for his party, but you need 163 seats to be the majority in the parliament. So he and his party were not able to increase from 91 to the majority, whereas Maliki, his party won 89 and he was able to cobble together a coalition with some other Shia parties and to reach 163. Now however, not only are the Shia parties in the government, but also the Kurds and the Sunnis have joined as well. __EOS__ How involved were U.S. officials in reaching this power-sharing agreement in Baghdad? __EOS__ You know, U.S. officials probably more involved than anyone else -any other foreign diplomats in terms of trying to be helpful and to be respectful. There's a lot of talk about whether the U.S. has some declining influence, but it's not so much U.S. declining interest - influence. What has happened is Iraq is developing a political system, and so they are able to manage these issues. And I think our job should be to be helpful but not to interfere. __EOS__ Let me ask you about another concern here, which is that it's Iran who is coming out on top. Prime Minister Maliki, as we heard, now allied with the Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. If Iran is happy about Shia unity in Iraq, does it follow that the United States should not be happy? ",3

But if the lock, you know, on my house is some kind of a combination lock where you have to solve three quadratic equations to lock the door, I've hugely increased the risk of leaving my door unlocked.__EOS__ Let me try it this way and see if this is more convincing. What happened in our financial system before the crisis was over a period of decades the system outgrew, found a way around all the safeguards we put in place after the Great Depression.

And to prevent that risk, all you need to do, and I'm saying, you know, I'm trying to reach for a simple thing, maybe I'm making your point, is force that set of core institutions to hold sticker shock absorbers against the risk of loss. Because you cannot know what the future brings.__EOS__  when you say we did this, we made the securities that way, would say actually they did. The people who were issuing the securities managed to get all the regulations changed in their favor, to make the financial sector exactly what it was at the beginning of the...__EOS__ But to understand the perception, given the scale of innovation, but the vital, critical decisive problem was a more simple problem, which is people did not anticipate the risk that house prices might fall, we could face a bad recession and that might induce a financial panic.",0

So how did he end up going so very, very wrong? __EOS__ Well, he wanted to put all that energy into doing bad things. He didn't want to go and work anywhere.

51489," My guess is Dexter Filkins. 'His article about Kurdistan and ISIS is in the current edition of the New Yorker. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Dexter Filkins. He's a writer for the New Yorker. He's been covering Iraq and the region since before the beginning of the Iraq war. He used to write for the New York Times. In the current of the New Yorker he has a piece about Kurdistan and the Peshmurga. So let's get back to Kurdistan in northern Iraq. The Kurds want to be independent from Iraq and be totally self-governing. United States wants to keep Iraq intact. You write that the Kurds really see this war against Isis as an opportunity that may help them gain independence. What's the connection?__EOS__ Well, I, you know, I think we saw the connection when ISIS moved into Iraq and the Iraqi army collapsed. I mean, 50,000 soldiers and policemen overnight just disappeared, threw their uniforms away, literally in some cases were running through the streets in their underwear. And I interviewed a lot of these deserters, but the Iraqi - I mean, that wasn't just the Iraqi army collapsing, which, by the way, was built at enormous American expense, you know, billions and billions of dollars over the years. So I think that was a measure of the collapse of the Iraqi state. So the Iraqi state has basically failed. And the Kurdish state is very, very strong. It's very cohesive. It's - you know, Kurdistan is essentially a self-governing entity. And so I think the Kurds look at the rest of Iraq and they look out and they say we have never had anything except bloodshed and tragedy visited on us by the government in Baghdad. And we are not going to do anything to save this country anymore and it's time to leave. And I think what potentially enables that - I mean, it's a - you know, we're talking about a landlocked area of probably 7 million people. What really enables that is that it turns out, as we've discovered over the past 10 years or so,  that the Kurds are sitting on an ocean of oil and huge reserves of oil. And so, you know, all the big American oil companies are there, European companies are there. And they haven't - they're not really pumping all that much oil yet, but there's a ton of oil there. But the thing that makes that really difficult for the Kurds is that they're landlocked. So they need another country to allow them to move their oil out to see where they can get out and sell it. And they've had a really, really hard time doing that. You know, the Iraqis aren't going to help them. The Iranians aren't super helpful. Syria is a nightmare. And so that leaves Turkey and the Turks have historically been very hostile to the Kurds. And so lately, over the last 10 years or so as the Turks have just - you know, the economic boom in Kurdistan has made a lot of Turkish companies rich and so that's kind of transformed their relationship. And so there's a pipeline now that Turks are allowing the Kurds to ship their oil, but it's very, very complicated because the Americans for one thing - I mean, the White House is, because it's opposed to Kurdish independence, it's kind of put the word out that, you know, as they feel obliged to do that, gee, any country or any company that buys Kurdish oil could get a lawsuit. And so that's really chilled the market for the Kurds. It's made it very difficult for them to sell their oil. And so there's literally something like 11 - I don't know - 11, 12, 13, 14 Kurdish tankers filled with oil at sea right now looking for buyers. Some of those tanker, you know, they're filled with oil. Some of them have sold and some of them haven't because it's becoming really, really difficult. And, you know, these tankers are like - they've turned their beacons off so they can't be tracked and they're offloading oil in the, you know, the middle of the ocean to other tankers. And it's become this really, really, you know, weird game. But essentially, oil is the key to Kurdish independence. If they can sell their oil, then I think probably they're home free. But if they can't, then they're in trouble because Baghdad has basically cut them off from any kind of revenue. They're landlocked. You know, and if they can't sell their oil then they can't pay their bills.__EOS__ Right and because Baghdad has cut them off from revenue and because they're having trouble selling their oil, the government has been unable to pay its workers for - well, for all of this year so far.",3
51490," Yes. I noticed that... __EOS__ Don't say anything. __EOS__ Right. I mean people can see you walking down the fairway just chattering away. And what are you talking about?

You know what; you're just trying to figure something out. Talk about how you're feeling you know, what you felt.

51494," Yes, he was. And it all came from the British scientific establishment, who were - who believed that the key element in any human ancestor must have been a large brain. They believed that the brain led the way in human evolution. __EOS__ And it's interesting. One of the reasons he was mocked was because he'd had the nerve to combine Greek and Latin in one expression. They denounced him for being a poor classicist. __EOS__ Yes, I mean, it was an absurd piece of elitism that the members of the British scientific establishment were highly critical of his claims. And a lot was made of the fact that he had combined two different names, Australo, meaning southern, which is of Greek origin, and pithecus, which means ape, from Latin origin, and it was described as being a barbaric combination of Greek and Latin. __EOS__ And it's a broader point that there are existing schools of thought, and when evidence is brought up that contradicts them, they are thrown out of court as if they're unimportant because they don't accord with the largest school of thought, and you mention that.

51497," And how did supermarkets change for example, the role of people who worked in the supermarket, in grocery stores? __EOS__ Before the supermarket, grocery stores were pretty small. You might have two or three people; a store that had meat might have five or six people working in it. There was a store manager but the store manager worked alongside all the other workers - opening boxes, putting things on shelves, serving customers. A supermarket was an entirely different business. You needed a full-time manager. You needed workers who were specialized, because the store was so large so you had some workers who just handled boxes. You had some workers who just handled the cash register to deal with the stream of customers. So workers' lives in general became more specialized and more regimented. This was not a personal business as running a small grocery store was. In a supermarket you are likely not to know your customers. You had masses of people coming through and you simply had an hourly job. __EOS__ And once they had these bigger stores, their manufacturing operations and distribution operations made it easier for them to put their stuff on the shelves in big quantities and at low prices - give them even more of a competitive advantage, right? __EOS__ Sure. And A&P had very powerful brands. A&P had a brand called Jane Parker, for example, that it used on baked goods, very well-known. A&P had Eight O'Clock Coffee. And so it wasn't just the stores. It had a reputation for high-quality merchandise, much of which it manufactured in its own factories. And the supermarket really gave A&P a way to push those products through the system - to take advantage of its vertical integration, to keep prices low and to pump more food out to customers. ",0
51498," Well, I think that Christine Sommers work and the article she wrote is drawing attention to a bias that's there that does have, not just disproportionate impact on boys, but particularly boys of color, black and Latino boys, and something that we should be aware of. At the same time, I want to complicate the issue some and recognize and point out that men still dominate our society.__EOS__ Dean Pianta, why don't you complicate the issue further too, because your research has shown that teachers' own expectations and beliefs to affect the classroom dynamic. Do you think that this is contributing or how do you think this might contribute to how boys are doing in school?__EOS__ Sure. Well, you know, I think it should come as no surprise that teachers factor children's behavior into the grades that they assign them and that there is a discrepancy between grades and test scores. You know, the classroom environment, you know, advantages, compliance and performance - those are the kinds of things that are valued there, and a teacher has to manage, you know, 25 or 30 kids. And in that context, particularly with a, you know, increasing pressure on test scores and accountability types of performance of rote and kind of factual skills, these are not particularly interesting environments for a lot of kids, whether they're boys or girls.__EOS__ And we also do a fairly poor job of supporting teachers to engage kids effectively in the ways that they interact with them. And so you put that combination of things together - a set of cultural expectations and beliefs about what we value in kids and in schools. We send messages that boys tend to be more aggressive or more active. We make attributions of those behaviors as being problematic in a particular environment and you set this kind of trap for kids whose behavior deviates from, you know, kind of accepted norms of compliance and conformance. And whether they're boys or girls or Latino or black or young or old, they tend to get excluded and dealt with harshly.",3

51506," The bonus from the federal government for manufacturing the weapons.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ Exactly. And at Rocky Flats, production was always the highest priority, and safety of workers and certainly of local residents in their surrounding communities always took second place to that. Production was the most important thing.",0
51507," I have to ask, Lindsay, what is your relationship with guns?__EOS__ I only shoot cameras.__EOS__ And I am truly a very unlikely candidate for doing this project. Four years ago, I didn't know the difference between over-under and a side-by-side. And if you had asked me what the castle doctrine was, I would have thought that had something to do with King Arthur's Court. I really had no idea about gun culture. So I didn't have any really strong feelings about guns one way or the other.__EOS__ Has that changed?",0
51508," Guo Jingming is a different kind of writer. For a start, he's the man singing this love song, which he penned himself. This 25-year-old author is a celebrity, more of a pop idol than a writer. He poses for pinups, drives a Cadillac and sometimes takes bodyguards to book signings to protect him from the devotions of his young female fans. When asked about his runaway success, he paints himself as the voice of a generation. __EOS__  Before me, Chinese authors were pretty old. And today's young people don't understand life depicted by older authors. So they like my work because it's by a writer their age, about stuff very close to their lives. __EOS__ In person, Guo is a 5'1"" androgynous sprite, sitting on a white fur couch in his office, his dyed chestnut locks tucked into a black Gucci cap, his white jeans cinched with a Hermes belt. __EOS__  If you're the poorest out of all your friends, you don't have a sense of freedom. You think a lot about the pressures of life. China's young people nowadays are divided quite obviously into different classes. Some people are very rich, some are average. ",0
51509," Thank you, Simon.__EOS__ You've been thinking about these issues and working on them for 20 years. What do you think drove people to commit genocide?__EOS__ There are many reasons why people kill each other. One of those reasons is, of course, bad leadership. When leaders teach the people they lead to kill others, then people go ahead in what their leaders tell them. A second reason is because people are poor and are not educated well enough. They always, as I said, tend to trust their leaders, and, also, the worst reason this is the impunity. In Rwanda, for instance, we have been losing people since I was a young kid, late '50s, early '60s.__EOS__ Twenty years after the genocide, are you angry at the Western world, the United Nations, the U.S., the European Union for not doing more?",1

You co-wrote the song with Mick Jagger, but you originated it, and you didn't know you were doing it. Can you...? __EOS__ I wish all the songs could come this way, you know, where you just dream them, and then the next morning, there they are, presented to you. __EOS__ Well, I didn't do anything. You know, maybe I hit a button when I was asleep. So I put it back to the beginning and pushed play and there, in some sort of ghostly version, is  da, da, da, da, da - I can't get no satisfaction. __EOS__ But there's the song in its embryo, and I actually dreamt the damned thing. You know, and I'm still waiting for another dream. ",0
51512," We have to address one more issue before we let you go so I'll start with you, Corey, cause I'm going to give Ron the last word here. I give you the first word so I'm going to give him the last word today. Two federal circuit courts issued opposites rulings this week about whether subsidies for the Affordable Care Act are legal. Some legal experts assume this will end up before the Supreme Court. With these subsidies in dispute there's a new GAO report saying that the program is vulnerable to fraud. I mean, do you still count this as a possibility?__EOS__ Oh, no question. And evidence comes out every week that says is a policy success. Number one, right now you have more people who have healthcare than any time in the history of our country - that is a proven fact. The second is we see the law is working - more than $90 billion has been returned into individuals and families as rebates because insurance company's are either have excessive profits or they're not using those funds to actually provide services and insurance to families so they're getting those rebates. And then you see overall it's helping us to save money. So the program is definitely working. What you see here, this week is a classic argument between the letter of the law versus the interpretation of the law. The letter of the law says what it says about having that not applying properly so that it can't be used. The interpretation of the law says of course the federal government is able to do this and provide these subsidies.__EOS__ Let me give Ron a chance to weigh in and finally I just want to say that NPR is reporting that 57,000 immigrant kids have come since October not 70,000 plus. I just want to sort of tell you that this is what our reporting said. Ron final thought for you, you know, is that Republicans have, you know,  there've been dozens of house votes to repeal or defund the program. Is this a fight still worth having on the Republican side.__EOS__ Yeah, I think it is. I think it's, you know, when Corey says that millions more people say have coverage, that's right, but there's a difference between having healthcare coverage and having access to a doctor. You're finding a lot more providers are denying folks on Medicaid - the ability to go to see them because of course they're not being fully reimbursed by the federal government. This is very important. The very statue says it's an exchange that is run by the that is entitled for people to have subsidies, not the federal government running a exchange. And a far better lawyer, far better mind than mine Laurence Tribes said that within a year or more the Obama Care that we see now won't exist.",3
51513," You know, I hate to even think about those moments even though those games, you know, I think it only made us better. I think you have - in order to be successful you have to go through, you know, trials and tribulations throughout basketball and throughout life to become better, you know. And I think that's why we - you know, I dedicated one chapter to the point of us losing big games that we thought we could have a chance to win but ultimately made us better. __EOS__ Made you better because it taught you that you weren't quite as good as you thought you were. __EOS__ Yeah, exactly. You know, it basically put us back in our position. You know, but it helped us, you know, mentally just, you know, refocus, you know. And every time we lost we may have been just a little bit, you know, I don't know to say, arrogant but not as focused as we knew we could have been. So, you know, when we lost the game that we thought we should have won at the time, you know, we refocused ourself and we was ready the next time. __EOS__ Dru Joyce, let me ask you, obviously part of this book is the story of your relationship with your son. And I must say it's an unflinching look at that relationship. There's also the story of you as a coach, somebody who did not start as a basketball coach, who learned it as he went along, as you were coaching these kids in games like that AAU Championship game that we're talking about.

51514," When you got out of prison, were you able to find work? You had won journalism awards in prison editing the prison magazine. Did you want to practice journalism when you got out? __EOS__ Absolutely. But the thing is, I knew before I got out, Terry, that I would be unemployable. I would not be able to work as a journalist because the problem with being high-profile is you have to detractors, even people who dont know you. I mean people who dont have no axe to grind with you they, you know, they just oh, they still have opinions about you. I didnt have the advantage of anonymity and which is why - what helps a lot of guys. And since I had the detractors... __EOS__ But you had such a good - you had awards. I mean you had an award-winning journalism career in prison. __EOS__ That doesnt mean anything in real life. What it means - in real life when youre talking about the media, youre talking about it's driven by advertising, and advertisers may have a problem with you having this ex-con on the staff. So, you know, that's just the way it is. I understood that before I got out. I understood that I would probably end up having to be self-employed. And... ",0

51516," Oh, yeah. __EOS__ It was a... __EOS__ It could be more than that too, I understand. __EOS__ It could be a lot more than that. And it's also just three years of your life. At that age, it's a very disconcerting thing just to go and be in the army. It was a big crisis for me to have to go to the army. I was very lucky that I did get into a program in the army where they allow musicians of high talent to continue being musicians through the army. And I actually did a lot of arrangements for army bands and the army orchestra. ",2
51517,"  A lot of times, when critics review an album, they kind      of review it like they're reviewing a book.  You know, they just take the      lyric sheet and they talk about it, and sometimes, a line that looks      really stupid on paper can sound amazing and sound really meaningful and      vice versa. __EOS__  Fountains of Wayne's new album ""Out of State Plates"" is a      closet-cleaning collection of unreleased recordings by the band.  One of      the stand-out tracks is a cover of this well-know hit. __EOS__   Give me a sign, hit me, baby, one more      time. __EOS__   Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know      something wasn't right here?

The band members are Peter Rowan, Jody Stecher, Keith Little, and Paul Knight. __EOS__ Yeah, you know, he was a real person. He just got, he gave himself to the music. He gave himself to his audience and he became a big blank screen upon which people could project anything. And that's one of the sacrifices of being a performer. And he loved to play so he never turned down an opportunity to play music. If it was going to be music he'd do that over anything. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ He just didn't want a whole lot of conceptualizing over something that was fleeting and I think that permeated his worldview. ",2
51519," Yeah. And it was a reaction to the out-of-control mythology that had gone before, all of the George Washington slept here myths and all of the greatness of Washington myths. They had become so ridiculous and so foolish that Woodward just felt he had to get rid of them. __EOS__ And they took to describing this man, who had been described in the past as, among other things, a very fine dancer, as a guy with big hands and feet who could barely move right. __EOS__ That's right. And he - it's almost like he pawed apelike at any woman who passed his way. And women were constantly jilting him. __EOS__ You have been immersed in Washington's papers. You've written about him as well and now have written about those who've written so peculiarly about him. What nugget of truth survives for you?

I mean...__EOS__ So I mean like what have you really changed in your life?__EOS__ I mean I, you know, I, you know, I think that there's certain ways that people, you know, are always themselves. But I do think people change and I feel like that is the hopefulness that I think the show tries to get at. And I do think that, you know, that's a big question that, you know, both Laura and I have discussed throughout the entire shooting and the writing of the show and, you know, how the enlightenment is Amy.__EOS__ You know, I think one of the reasons why people, like, in their late teens or early 20s have to leave home, whether it's to go to out-of-town college or just like to move to another place or start a new life some place else, is because sometimes in order to change you have to leave behind the people who insist that you are who you are and you can't be anybody different.",3
51522," Well, at this point the decision is to go ahead until the decision not to proceed further. Where we are so far is to develop this so that it can be provided to manufacturers. So they can put it in their respective systems and optimize its growth characteristics and to begin to manufacture it. They can do that on a smaller scale. That won't occur until mid June. And we'll need to have a go or no go decision around them. __EOS__ Give us a sense of some of the calculations that have to be made before that decision can be made. For example, would we likely be given a swine flu vaccine in addition to, would it be mixed in the cocktail for next year's flu shots, or would it replace things that would otherwise be in those shots? __EOS__ We haven't made a final decision on this. But I'm suspecting that the way things are developing with the current seasonal flu vaccine and this one, by timing alone, this might come after the seasonal vaccine is ready to be delivered for the fall season. On top of that, the other key thing that needs to go on between now and when the vaccine would be ready, would be to do the important testing to try to find out what the right dose is and whether or not this needs one or two doses. Some of those things would also factor in on whether or not it will be appropriate to fold into the seasonal vaccine. __EOS__ So it sounds like perhaps at least several months, if not a year, before we could have such a vaccine if we decided to produce one. ",3
51523," And what was it like for you when - I don't even know if you were old enough to understand the level of your mother's fame.__EOS__ No, probably not, because in '75 I was three years old. But it was - what my parents were doing seemed normal, because that's what they were doing when I was born. You know, my mom was music. So, you know, music poured out of my mother, and I'm sure I heard it, you know, before I even got here, you know, when I was in her belly. And music sounds and feels very normal to me.__EOS__ So let's hear your mother's hit, ""Lovin' You."" And this is from 1975. This is Maya Rudolph's late mother, Minnie Riperton.__EOS__  Lovin' you is easy 'cause you're beautiful. Makin' love with you is all I want to do. Lovin' you is more than just a dream come true.

No one's going to appoint the 37-year-old whose only experience in life has been a former prosecutor and a partner at a law firm.__EOS__ Not that being a judge was easy. The first year, she says, there was so much to learn that she sometime had not a headache but a brain ache. It was the steepest learning curve of her life, she says, steeper even than her first year on the Supreme Court.__EOS__ That first year on the district court, I wasn't sure my nose was above the water.__EOS__ She would spend 17 years on the trial bench and the court of appeals and then in 2009, President Obama appointed her to the U.S. Supreme Court, the first Hispanic ever to hold the post.

And, of course, the great thing about America is that it is a country based in religious pluralism. And we found many, many Muslims on this journey still saying that America is the best place to be a Muslim. __EOS__ Our role model is Thomas Jefferson. So there is the awareness among Muslims that things may be bad but they would still be worse back home, wherever they come from. __EOS__ At the beginning of your book, you describe an uncomfortable visit to a mosque, a congregation in Omaha, Nebraska.

How do you make it right when you apologize? __EOS__ Well, first of all, I mean, the Iraqis themselves, many of them were opposed to the violence that was being imposed by al-Qaida, especially suicide bombings. Even if they didn't support the American occupation, they did oppose al-Qaida violence. __EOS__ And was it important to apologize to the men of the house in front of their families? ",0
51547," Well, it was awfully - that goes to my point about how it's a small industry. __EOS__ Let's go next to Mike. Mike's calling us from Cincinnati. __EOS__ Hi. I just wanted to make the point that I think that your ability to negotiate and to be able to walk away is, it's really situational. There are times when you are completely powerless, and I have a brief example of that. __EOS__ Go ahead. ",0
51548," Dr. Williams, we're all, obviously, horrified by this story. But the question, I think, on everybody's mind is how could this happen? I mean, what would be going through someone's mind that would cause this? __EOS__ From what I've read, it sounds like depression, and psychotic depression to be exact. And this poor woman, you know, it sounds like she's been struggling all of her life, barely making it out of school and having become dependent on what sounds like a decent guy. You know, finally she, you know, had been happy after years of struggling with two other children, and then as life happens, he died of cancer. __EOS__ That kind of let her unmoored. __EOS__ Right. And so, I mean, life - you know, people think that life is supposed to be level and stable. But life happens. Good things happen. Great things happen. But sometimes in everybody's life, tragedy happens. And at those times, you need to rely on the skills you have, but also the people around you need to step in and make sure that you're okay. And it sounds like combination of friends, family, state and fed government, you know, kind of let her down. ",3
51549," They were your backup band before they became famous.__EOS__ They were my backup band, and I just got out of the way.__EOS__ So the song I want to play from your first album of Mexican songs is - and I'm going to say this wrong, ""Rogaciano El Huapanguero.""__EOS__ Huapanguero, yeah, ""Rogaciano El Huapanguero."" A huapango is a certain kind of song, it's a style of singing.",2
51550," .__EOS__ You're back to the normal world, so, you know, once the amps go off and all that kind of stuff and you walk down the steps from the stage - yes, it's a different thing. And you're kind of back into reality in a way, so I know about that. And Hendrix, you know, he wasn't that confidence to start with. It's been documented. He didn't, you know, even the first time in the studio, like, he was amazed, like, scared at his own voice coming out of the microphone. He didn't want to be the lead, man, he didn't. So, you know, he was just shy in that way, but at the same time he had a confidence in his plan and he knew it. I heard interviews where you could hear, you know, he was kind of cocky. At certain times about his guitar playing when people tried to compare him to other players. But I think his vocal ability he wasn't too sure about, and, you know, I can say I've been there before. Like, first Outkast shows - they were kind of like, you know, I hardly could move because it's a new thing. And you got to get used to it, but once you've done it, you know, for a while you kind of get into your own confidence and we see that in Hendrix in this movie.__EOS__ My guests are John Ridley, who wrote and directed the new film ""Jimi  All Is By My Side,"" and Andre Benjamin, who stars as Jimi Hendrix. We'll talk more after break. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guests are John Ridley, who wrote and directed the new film ""Jimi  Always By My Side,"" which is about one year in Hendrix's life. The year that he was in England, right before going to the Monterey Pop Festival and becoming a star. He also wrote ""12 Years A Slave."" Also with us is Andre Benjamin, who's best known for his work in the band Outkast and he plays Jimi Hendrix in the movie. So there's a central scene in the movie in which Jimi Hendrix and one of his girlfriends go to buy marijuana from a dealer whose named Michael X, who's from the islands. He's from one of the Caribbean islands. And Michael X passes himself off as someone who's, like, very political. And he wants Hendrix's music to be more political or else he thinks - Michael X thinks - this music is trivial. Let me play an excerpt of that scene.",2
51551," Did you share that you didn't love, ""Do You Know the Way to San Jose"" with them? __EOS__ Yes, I did. __EOS__ Were their feelings hurt, or did they just not care? __EOS__ No, they didn't care. ",2
51552," I'm going back to my trailer, and when Ms. Davis gets herself together, call me.  And then when we were playing in the - in 21, we were all sitting there together. And so I came back from having talked to Eve in the ladies room.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ And Anne and I were very good friends. I mean, I loved everybody in the cast except Bette, because she wouldn't let you love her. So I - we were all sitting there, and I said  Did you know that the man who made the wonderful glass teapot, Pyrex, when he found out they were using it to make martinis, he stopped making them?__EOS__ I don't know how I've lived this long without knowing that.",1
51553," Is it harder to keep bees these days? __EOS__ It's a lot harder than it was, say, 20 or 30 years ago. I mean certainly in Britain in the old days, you could literally just leave a hive at the bottom of the garden and collect the honey at the end of the season, and hope that they didn't swarm and that would be okay. __EOS__ Bill, in the end, what's satisfying about beekeeping? __EOS__ It's a couple of things really. It's you're doing something positive. One, it gets you out into the fresh air away from the golf course, for instance, and away from the TV. And I have most of my hives on a farm and I get to pretend to be a farmer for an afternoon. And I go down to the orchard and the sun is shining when you do that. And you're helping the bees pollinate other things and create honey, and give you this lovely liquid gold harvest at the end of the summer. ",0
51554,"  .... __EOS__  Our next guests are one of the most talked about      bands here in New York in years.  We're happy to have them tonight.  Here      to perform ""Your Little Hoodrat Friend"" from their new album ""Separation      Sunday,"" this is The Hold Steady, everybody. __EOS__   Your little hoodrat friend makes me sick, but      after I get sick, I just get sad, because it burns being broke and it      hurts to be heartbroken, always being both must be a drag.  She's been      calling me again... __EOS__  On stage, the musicians strike an unlikely pose for would-be rock      stars.  Guitarist Tad Kubler's shaggy blond hair, tie and a shirt--tucked      in at his girlfriend's request--make him look something like a surfer      with a court date.  And then there's singer Craig Finn. ",2
51555,"  Oh yeah, sure, Carl.__EOS__  Well, Rita, it's an allegory about spiritual survival in the contemporary world. The main character is this freak of nature. He's this man who doesn't have a normal head. He was born with a dog's head.__EOS__  A dog's head?__EOS__  Yeah, you know, sort of a fantastical story.",1
51556," I mean, they were the Special Operations Executive. They were often parachuted into France during World War II to act as radio operators and to liaise with Resistance people on the ground. So they had an awful lot of information. They all carried code books, and if they were caught they were guaranteed to be tortured for that information, and they knew this. __EOS__ I feel the need in 2010 to talk about the passengers on United Flight 93. __EOS__ One of the reasons I wanted to do the passengers in Flight 93 was partly because I was, like a lot of people, I remember exactly where I was when the Twin Towers were hit on that particular day. I was teaching in a comprehensive school in London. I remember seeing it on the news and, you know, the whole world stopped. __EOS__ Let me ask you about our modern definition of heroes, because it does seem to me there's a phrase that's entered the language in recent years  exit strategy. And, of course, fruitless, vain charge of the light brigade kind of courage is something that is understandably diminished these days. But the term exit strategy sometimes nettles me. ",0
51557," Can we ask for the story about that? I mean, you didn't go out of your way to get married in a hospital. I guess in a sense, you did - right?__EOS__  We had applied to get married in Illinois. We had 60 days. We were never in the same town. My wife showed up, and we had one day left; and she walked in the door from Los Angeles, and I suddenly grabbed my stomach. I said, boy, I'm not feeling well. She said, you're not getting out of it that easy. But we wound up going to the emergency room. I had my gall bladder removed.__EOS__ Well, that's one way to say l'chaim, isn't it? I made a short list  addiction abuse, adultery, abandonment, imminent incest and just plain old hatred. So is every family is a little bit like the Westons of Osage County?__EOS__ What we have seen by doing this play is that the story of this family is pretty universal. And the dinner scene alone, in the theater - I can tell you that some people are howling with laughter, and other people are in tears and crawling under their seats. They find it very upsetting to watch because it hits pretty close to home.",1
51558,"  Tell me where my easy ride has gone… __EOS__ One of the interesting things that I've found is  you are, if nothing else, true to the South in terms of the kind of music you've selected throughout your career and also the interpretation of other songs really has a feeling of that Southern breeze, if you will. That is near and dear to your heart to this day, I would suspect, fair? __EOS__ It is very much. I really love my home. I love Mississippi. I love the South. I love our way of life. And I think when I left home in my mid-20's I lived in New York for quite a while, and I started to miss the South a lot; and I think that's what you feel and that's what your hear coming through the music. __EOS__  Tell me where my easy ride has gone… ",2
51559,"  Young man, I am delighted that you are interested in this job. I'm very busy. I did… __EOS__  One thought kept racing through my mind as Buck talked. I had no idea who this guy was. And I guess that must have shown. __EOS__  You do know who I'm, don't you? __EOS__  You have seen ""The Tonight Show."" ",3
51560,  Do you think a woman should be educate? __EOS__ Definitely. __EOS__  But is it not a problem that a woman have a smaller brain than a man? __EOS__ That is wrong. ,3
51561," And I had, like, an eating disorder in high school for a bit, so it's like, I think God kind of put me through that to, you know, make me stronger for when situations like that kind of come up and still come up, obviously.__EOS__ You - that time in L.A. after high school, those four or five months you lived there, they were kind of a disaster, right?__EOS__ Oh, my God. I lived, like, on a mattress, like, with this crazy girl. We lived in, like, a room with, like, these people's house and, like, they didn't allow us to use their kitchen. So we had, like, a little refrigerator. Like, it was really funny. But I mean, at the time...__EOS__ You were waiting tables and things like that?",2
51562," ""The Rover"" is a spare, uncompromisingly bleak film set in a very particular future. It's 10 years after a worldwide economic collapse, and the Australian outback is populated by unhinged people, exhausted by heat and despair. And then Eric shows up. Eric is a bearded, sweaty, sun-burnt man - a fierce-eyed individual whose thousand-yard stare could solidify molten lava. As played by Guy Pearce in a performance of pure, controlled ferocity, Eric is the last person whose car you want to steal. But that's just what a gang of thieves does in ""The Rover's"" opening minutes. Eric questions everyone he meets, repeating - I'm looking for my car - in a quiet monotone. Eric catches a break when he comes across the gang-leader's seriously wounded brother. The only man who can help him find his car.__EOS__  Where's your brother? Where is he? You tell me where he is, or I'm going to kill you. Where is he?__EOS__ That wounded brother is convincingly played by Robert Pattison in a role that is as far from the ""Twilight"" series as he could possibly get. The brother is damaged, twitchy, unfocused - a lost soul in a pitiless world, and Eric focuses on getting him to tell what he knows.__EOS__  Anything that means anything right now is that I'm here and he's not. Your brother left you to die. That's what people do.",1
51563," Yes. And it was more difficult for him, because Anne told me that he used to call up every other day, because he was in New York and we were in L.A. And he would always start the conversation off with  Did he kiss you yet?__EOS__ He was a little jealous.__EOS__ So that's how you thanked him for offering you a role? Turning it down and going to bed with his wife.__EOS__ Yes.",1
51564," The crematories who agreed to help us are basically doing this as almost at a at-cost basis of $150 per case. I average about 20 cases per week. There was no budget set aside for it, so when this situation came to light in February, and we were facing it basically head-on, we had to evaluate how much are we doing a month, and at $150, what would the cost be? And unfortunately, we were already in the midst of a budget crisis to begin with. And we're just basically trying to put the department on cruise control to get through the end of the fiscal year, then this hit. __EOS__ So that's about $3,000 a week, $12,000 a month that you have to pay? __EOS__ Just about. __EOS__ And where are you taking the money from? ",3
51565," Well, there had been a square decision about - I forget the exact year now, holding to the contrary. It wasn't on exactly the same facts, but it held that the amendment protected military uses of firearms as the language of the amendment itself. __EOS__ The well-regulated militia language. __EOS__ Well, the militias and the right to bear arms, and the text of the amendment makes - refers specifically to military uses, and that had been the basic limitation in the law prior to that decision. __EOS__ But what about the well-regulated militia part and the difference between the originalists and others on the court? ",3
51566," Okay. I'm sorry about the earlier technical difficulties we had, and apologies for that. Can you tell us how you apply these principles there in Brooklyn? __EOS__ Yeah. I think really similar to what Julie Jackson was saying, is that a lot of our teachers - this is the language we build for teachers when they come into the school. So whether they are a first-year teacher in the first days in the classroom or just new to our school, this is just some of the expectations that we have for teachers around how to build an effective classroom culture. __EOS__ And can you talk about some specific technique that helped you when you were a teacher? __EOS__ Absolutely. I think the one that I loved the most is the 100 percent. And I love it for a number of reasons. And it's kind of the backbone of what our school is about and I think a lot of what successful schools are about. Just the idea that what we're expecting from students is not that a couple of them achieve or a couple of them follow directions, but that when you're talking to a group, that you're seeing 100 percent following  directions and ultimately 100 percent achieving. ",0
51567," ...But also something that you have continually hoped would not be in some ways.__EOS__ But I was also taught at a very early age - is that some things will always be there. And I think race is something that, irrespective of how much we may try, it will always be there.__EOS__ Let me talk to you about that because one of the things that you do in the book is you describe some of the day-to-day indignities...__EOS__ Yes.",0
51568," Don Van Natta, Babe Didrikson should have been embraced as an American hero, but for much of her life she was really seen as this kind of an oddball, even a freak. How has our image of her changed over time, do you think? __EOS__ She's, I think, one of the great American forgotten athletic superstars. I went to Beaumont when I began research on this book seven years ago, and there was a little museum there for Babe. It's a building that's just devoted only to Babe Didrikson. You can see her two gold medals and her silver medal, a key to Denver that was given to her after she won the Women's Amateur in Scotland. __EOS__ And probably a reality TV show. __EOS__ Yes. Right. ",0
51569," All right, follow me, follow me. And we start running, you know, down this corridor, and you see, like, other hotel guests looking at us. And he's - I go  Where are we going? He goes  Just follow me, follow me.__EOS__ Why are you doing that? He says  Get out, get out the window. Jump out. So I look outside the window, and we're 14 stories up, and it's a building from I think 1910, and there's an old, rickety fire escape there. And so he said, come on, go, go, go, the police are going to get you. Come on.__EOS__ How do we get down? He goes  Jump, jump.__EOS__ That sounds really horrible. And it reminds me of something that Jerry Seinfeld was quoted as saying in the New York Times, in an article about you.",1
51570," Both of these producers, Nile and Pharrell Williams, are very closely aligned with the kind of period that they came out of. I mean, Pharrell is one of the kind of definitive producers of the aughts' kind of modern hip-hop. And now, Rodgers, obviously, a huge voice of late '70s radio and disco.__EOS__ There was no sense on this record to think really about the music of the future rather than really to focus on, OK, what are we missing right now as music, and what is the music we want to make, but also let's just team up with musicians from different eras and different generation and really try to create something contemporary and right now to make the music of today.__EOS__ And it sounds like this speaks to the album title ""Random Access Memories."" Obviously, RAM is reference to a kind of computer data storage. What does it mean for you here?__EOS__ Well, it's really the, you know, the parallel between computers and hard drive and the human brain, but it's really also having fun with the word memory, which has become a very technical, very sterile term. And, obviously, when you use the plural, which is memories, it's something that is totally different. It's something that is highly emotional. This felt interesting to us right now in a world that is predominantly technological today.",2
51571," That is a great point. I think it's a really interesting point, and I'm thrilled that so many of our women writers are doing great. It's a little tricky in the literary world to figure out how well we're doing, because it's not like the Senate where we can count or the boardroom where we can count and we have those hard numbers. And I think there's a lot more - there are a lot more women writers who are doing amazing work than we do hear about, and I want those women writers to get as much press and get as much sort of blockbuster attention for their literary novels as, say, Jonathan Franzen and Jonathan Safran Foer - that category of the male literary blockbuster novel. __EOS__ But hasn't this argument been going on for a while between art and commerce, and is it really a different conversation for women? What's, you know, really what's different about this conversation on the women's side than it would be for, you know, male popular fiction, like the Tom Clancys, Scott Turows... __EOS__ That... __EOS__ ...versus, say, the more - what I think some would consider more serious sort of fiction, that perhaps males are more attracted to? ",0
51572," He would. And it was, you know, it was a great commentary, actually. It was very, you know, it was very Midwestern. __EOS__ You know, ""Eight and a Half,"" you go wow, this one's crazy isn't it? __EOS__ Did movies seem magical when you were young and if so, do they seem that way now that you have to make them and get the budget for them and deal with the horses for them and, you know, all that? __EOS__ You know, we had to look behind the curtain. It's terrible, in a way. ",1
51573," He did, very proudly.__EOS__ Aka is the name of the language.__EOS__ It is. Yeah.__EOS__  So when do we leave for the forest? .",1
51574," Well, first of all, it's beautiful on its own, you know, with the figs. And you could probably use other fruits as well. You could you - I think it would be really nice with raspberries. You could do a raspberry liqueur. But my suggestion for presentation is use a white plate. I find that people sometimes their dishes are too complicated and fussy. And if you put anything on a white background, it looks beautiful.__EOS__ Now, you don't see a lot of chocolate on Thanksgiving, which I think is a major oversight, so I was pleased that there was a chocolate recipe in this book - intense chocolate custard. It sounds really indulgent but the directions look kind of easy, right? Can you tell us what you do to make this?__EOS__ It's just bittersweet chocolate, a little bit of light cream and a tiny bit of butter. And you melt the chocolate, you add a little bit of water and you just stir it in until it's melted. And then you pour it into little glasses. I like to use shot glasses. I call it intense chocolate custard because it is very intense and you don't need a whole lot to be satisfied. And then you put little chocolate nibs on top.__EOS__ Plus it's kind of nice. You've just had this big meal and Thanksgiving is kind of all about excess, so it's nice to think about streamlining your dessert to make it small, intense special.",0
51575," Well, generally speaking, you'd get an email in your mailbox that says hi, hope you're having a good day. __EOS__ By the way, I'm going to take your business down if you don't give me $100,000 or $20,000. Do it now, and talk to you soon. __EOS__ It's nothing that you'd expect. It doesn't come across incredibly serious at the beginning. __EOS__ But in fact it happens, right? ",0
51576," Hi. Can you hear me all right? __EOS__ Yes. You're on the air. Go ahead, please. __EOS__ Yes, Charlie. __EOS__ All right. Yes. I have the same situation only not from a five generations. This is actually my natural accent. I'm Scot-Irish and I'm also a Welsh in ancestry. My brother died at an - his early 50's with complications of full-blown schizophrenia. My father - on my - my father was paranoiac and schizophrenic and violent. And my grandmother, also was schizophrenic. And that's three in a row and so I never had children. It's a terrible toll upon the family and I've a medical background and frankly, such onset in the late - early 20's, in late teens is a very common thing for schizophrenia. It's unfortunate nowadays that they call that manic depressive a lot. But when you are hearing voices and you are not even in tangential touch with the universe that we know, that's schizophrenia. My brother was just, basically, came home after a few weeks out in the real world, totally out of control and totally the rest of his of life was just like that. And I have great sympathy for your situation and for the problems that you face in your life and I think that this is something that may well be genetically inherited within Celtic people in general. Not that everybody that you meet that's Irish and colorful is crazy, also, I have one other comment and that is an awful lot of people who drink are actually tight shading - self- to medication for schizophrenia and I've met that a lot with my brother. ",0
51577," You know, after the 9/11 attacks, there was an effort to change the way the intelligence community operated. The 9/11 Commission called for a complete overhaul to deal with the fact that information was not shared among disparate agencies. You know, dots weren't connected and signals, you know, signs, clues, were lost that might have detected the 9/11 plot. And there was this idea that we're going to create a director of national intelligence, someone that could make all of the parts work smoothly together and get out of their kind of bureaucratic isolationism.__EOS__ They hated the idea of an intelligence czar. You have to understand that each of the 16 intelligence agencies that existed before the creation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, they're bureaucracies and they have a bureaucratic identity and lifespan of their own. Which means that, you know, they love their independence. So I mean, it's in that sense, they're no different than a major corporation.__EOS__ But surely they recognized that the inability to share information and coordinate investigations harmed the effort, endangered the country. What did they think needed to be done, if not, you know, a new intelligence czar, some directorate?__EOS__ Well, the purpose of the, you know, the creating the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was exactly as you suggested, to create an intelligence czar, a strong individual who would sit on top of the 16 other intelligence agencies and force them to share information and work together in peace and harmony.",0
51578," Do you think of yourself as somebody who is the kind of fellow who is beloved by all, yet loved by none? __EOS__ We are verging into territory that's a little too personal. __EOS__ That's fine. __EOS__ So let me just say... ",3
51579,"  Even though I dont say it often enough, I appreciate everything you did for us. Never take you for granted cause it ain't hard see, the best parts of you are now a part of me. Oh, Momma. And when it was cold outside, you kept us warm and held us down. __EOS__ Hi, boys. Who wants a snack? __EOS__ Mom, get out. We're in the studio. __EOS__ Just checking on my guys. ",2
51580," Well, it's a normal occurrence now to see, you know, the Secretary of State or any kind of cabinet member just - they walk into the restaurant and sit down. And they're treated just like everybody else in town. The president has been wonderful about including the community, especially the school children, for things like, when Vladimir Putin came to town, the high school kids were the ones that asked the questions to the president and President Putin. So, world events here are more like local events and not just something that you see on the news.__EOS__ Well, the Bushes, I gather, are planning to keep the ranch. So you likely would be seeing them again, just not into the presidential seal necessarily.__EOS__ Well, we don't normally look at him as, you know, the suit and tie and jacket kind of president that you see on the television. We see him a little more down to earth and joking and he's himself when he's in town. I'll be looking forward to seeing him at our roundtable in the morning, just sipping his coffee, to see him a little more, a little more relaxed, that part will be good.__EOS__ Well, Valerie Citrano, it's good to talk to you. Thanks very much.",3
51581," Yeah. He's famous for being cheap. __EOS__ Yeah. So, what did you learn from the real cheap side of special effects... __EOS__ ...that you later applied to the real expensive side of special effects? __EOS__ It's a funny question because I was just talking to Roger last night, and I haven't seen him in years, but we ran into each other, and we were joking about the fact that he's made - probably all of his movies combined would not have cost as much as ""Avatar."" And he's made, you know, 100 films. ",1
51582," Yes. Well, I'm sure you or whoever else is interested can go through and pick out a lot of... __EOS__ ...a lot of similarities between, you know, these character's experiences and my own. And that's, you know, that's one thing that you do as a writer or an artist of any sort, you use pieces of your own life. __EOS__ My guest is James Franco. His collection of short stories, ""Palo Alto,"" will be published later this month. He plays Allen Ginsberg in the new film ""Howl."" __EOS__  You cut your hair. You hurt yourself. Are you okay? ",1
51583,"  I know.  I know that.  I know that.  I was writing love      songs.  I mean, I--was my behavior good?  No, but it was what it was.      So, hey, look what happened to me, you know?  I changed. __EOS__  While I have you here, I do want to ask you a couple of things      that maybe some of your biggest fans don't know that we found out while      we were preparing for this interview.  I hope you don't mind.  You were      once the musical director for Marlene Dietrich? __EOS__  Sure.  We played songs like  `Falling in love      again, never wanted to.  What am I to do?  I can't help it.' __EOS__  You also wrote the theme music to the sci-fi film ""The Blob""? ",2
51584," The bottom line is the Coleman side has maintained all along, ever since it fell behind in the tally, that in some places absentee ballots were rejected for reasons that they would not have been rejected in other places. So if you were voting by absentee ballot in one county and the witness that signed your absentee ballot packet was not a registered voter, some places in Minnesota, that ballot would not have been accepted, opened and counted. In other places it would've. __EOS__ And how many ballots are actually at stake in that argument? __EOS__ All told, there were about 12,000 rejected absentee ballots. Both campaigns all along have maintained that the vast majority of them were rejected for valid reasons. The Coleman campaign, says right now officially that it things about 4,000 rejected absentee ballots were wrongly rejected and therefore should be opened and included in the recount. And they have been expressing confidence all along, that if all the properly cast ballots, as they'll call them, were opened and counted, that Senator Coleman would prevail. __EOS__ And what does the Franken side say about those absentee ballots? ",3
51585," ""Whisper Not,"" I gather, is the title of your forthcoming autobiography. __EOS__ Yes, it's coming. The problem is the publisher wants no more than 300 pages. I have well over a thousand. So... __EOS__ Oh my word. __EOS__ Trying to boil it down. ",2
51586," So I guess I just want to say thank you. Thank you for the interview. Thank you even more for your movies and your music. I'm so happy that I've had the chance to talk with you because I know how little of this you do.__EOS__ I'm happy that I had a chance to talk to you too, Terry. And it is Terry, isn't it?__EOS__ Yes, it is.__EOS__ Isn't that funny.",1
51587," Go ahead, please. __EOS__ I was calling to discuss the March 2002, incident in the Shah-i-Kot Valley of Afghanistan. That was an incident where I think three Chinooks were lost to al-Qaida and Taliban forces, and we had several special operators that lost their lives, as well. I think it was a classic underestimating of a motivated and well-trained enemy that has kind of characterized the war in Afghanistan. __EOS__ And why did you think it's - other than a bad mistake, how did it contribute to a turning point? __EOS__ Well, I think when you see big pieces of equipment starting to be destroyed and when you see - when you see the well-armed and well-trained Americans being confused by people with low technology and low weaponry, there was a lot of fratricide going on in that battle. And I think it was kind of a wake-up call that we can't just send - we can't just send lightly armed units with no backup and without a real rescue plan available. ",0
51588," When he retired he had more medals, like how many... __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ ...the second most medals... __EOS__ Depending on how you count them up, he was one of the most decorated police officers ever in the history of the NYPD. Which I think makes Eppolito's alleged fall from grace all the more fascinating. ",3
51589," ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is really one of the most kind of brutal, sadistic Westerns, in a way... __EOS__ No, it's done with tongue in cheek. It's not brutal. __EOS__ I know. I know there's a lot of humor in it. But what kind of mood did Leone tell you that he wanted? __EOS__ One of the things he said to me, he said, I want every shot to be done like Vermeer. I want the light to come in from the side windows. And he said to me, I don't want you to have your gun in a holster. I said, where will I put it? He said, with a lanyard around your neck. I said, oh. And then it dangles between my knees, right? ",1
51590," So what was different in terms of how you handled this article and how you typically handle articles that are investigative or critical of the organization that you're writing about, or the company you're writing about? __EOS__ Well, I had done a story a few months ago about Gannett's bonuses, and I spent four days trying to get the company to comment on what they did. And on Sunday night, just before deadline, they said  We're not going to comment on these bonuses. __EOS__ Really? You're a newspaper company. You're a publicly held company. These bonuses are a matter of public record, and you have nothing to say about them? And I just found that appalling. And I think some of that was sort of reflected in the fact that A, I didn't bother to call them, and B, that I was angry after I'd written about their last set of bonuses, that they clearly were a life beyond consequence, and they just stepped up and did it again and gave this guy a huge bag of money on the way out the door. __EOS__ My guest is David Carr. He writes the ""Media Equation"" column for the New York Times, and he's featured in the documentary ""Page One,"" which has just come out on DVD. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. ",3
51591," Sean Hayes in a scene from ""Will & Grace."" How was your character of Jack described in that first script, the one that you used to audition? __EOS__ Oh, gosh, I don't remember. But to me, you know, at the beginning of ""Will & Grace,"" I played Jack as the funny next-door-neighbor type, as we've seen in the past, and I thought that was my role. __EOS__ So you changed your interpretation of the character as time went on? __EOS__ Definitely, 100 percent, because I wanted to explore the - I wanted more distance between the types of gay characters between Jack and Will. ",3
51592," I was in my home on Jan 31st, when, at 9 o'clock in the morning, four men from the Intelligence Ministry came to my home. They confiscated my computers and a number of my documents and books. And then they took me to another building for interrogation. I was told that if I don't cooperate, if I don't confess to being a spy, that I would be taken to Evin that evening. And because they did not want to make a false confession and say that I was a spy, they took me to Evin prison. __EOS__ And it was how long before you were able to call your parents in North Dakota? __EOS__ I was allowed to call my parents about 11 days later, after I told my interrogators please let me call my father, at least, to let him know that I'm alive. And they forced me to tell him a lie — to tell him that I didn't know where I was and that I had been arrested for alcohol, but these were not true. __EOS__ For buying a bottle of wine, is what you told him. ",3
51593," Well, that's part of it. Lincoln always says, you know, why should they enlist unless we give them the promise of freedom? You know, and then later on, when people are urging Lincoln to rescind the proclamation, Lincoln says  How can I do that? We have promised these men in the Army freedom. How can we go back on that now that they have risked their lives and fought and died for the Union? __EOS__ Eric Foner will be back in the second half of the show. His new book is called ""The Fiery Trial  Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery."" Foner is a professor of history at Columbia University. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ Well, slavery is in the Constitution. The word slavery is not there until the 13th Amendment, which abolishes it. But it certainly - I mean the fugitive slave clause says slaves have to be sent back if they escape, the three-fifths clause gives the South added representation for part of its slave population. There's no question that as a state institution, slavery is protected by the Constitution. And so what gives Lincoln the authority to issue this order freeing most - not every single one - but most of the slaves in the South and, of course, it is issued as a military order. Lincoln issues it as commander-in-chief, in other words, it's to promote the military success of the Union Army. And Lincoln says that what gives me the authority to take military measures and emancipating the slaves is a military measure to undermine the ability of the Confederacy to fight this war. __EOS__ A lot of people think that President Lincoln freed all the slaves in the United States with the stroke of a pen - all the slaves in the United States and the Confederacy with a stroke of a pen. But you say it really wasnt quite that way, that it didnt free all the slaves. ",3
51594," Let me tell you how you collect...__EOS__ You might be wondering about the science behind this.__EOS__ Let me tell you how you collect that stuff.__EOS__ So now that you can visualize what's going on in your colon, do you feel your digestion more powerfully? Like do you visualize the food going down? Do you visualize the twist and turns in your intestines?",3
51595," How did he get Kennedy Civil Rights Bill started? The Republicans were keeping it bottled up in the House Rules Committee, which was chaired by a Southern racist named Howard W. Smith of Virginia - Old Judge Smith, they called him. And they couldn't get it out of the Rules Committee, because there weren't enough votes there to let the Rules Committee release it to the floor of the House.__EOS__ You know, Johnson was an ambitious man. And, you know, you write that he desperately wanted to become president, from an early age. So when events thrust him into the office, because of the Kennedy assassination, he has a few months to plan to keep the office. He has to secure the Democratic nomination. It's not at all clear what, you know, the Kennedy folks might do, and try and win - he needs to win the 1964 election. And you can look at his pursuit of the tax cut and of civil rights legislation and the war on poverty - which he also announces in this period - as in service of his presidential ambitions. So the question is how genuine was Lyndon Johnson's commitment to social justice?__EOS__ You know, that's a really good question. I mean, you're certainly right that ambition was the driving force in Johnson's life. But there always was this deep compassion. Let me tell you one incident that I think was very revealing. Johnson - when Lyndon Johnson is going to college, he's very, very poor. And he has to drop out between his sophomore and junior years to earn enough money to continue.__EOS__ Johnson would spell. I would repeat. Johnson would pronounce. I would repeat.",0
51596," It's really horrendous when you look at it as individual human being with feelings, with aspirations. Maybe that girl might have had somebody she really liked, but the whole thing changed because - let's call it what it is - because of the rape.__EOS__ I think it is fundamentally an ethnic thing, a cultural thing that should be understood in the cultural context.__EOS__ Sitting through that conversation, I wasn't prepared for what they said. I had actually convinced myself that dad didn't know anything about what had happened to the sisters, because I couldn't imagine how a person could know that and have that not sort of have you completely come apart at the seams, for knowing that this was most likely the reality of your sisters. And so I was really struggling in that moment, in that interview.__EOS__ What is it that we're going to share with our kids, about who they are and where they come from? And we're at that crossroads in that moment in that conversation, because I'm pretty sure that is the last conversation my dad wanted to have with me, let alone on camera. But you know, it just - he walked right into it and knew that that was going to be the question that I would ask.",1
51597," You know what? Not at all. It was quite the opposite. I always had the plan of moving to L.A. They knew I always wanted to do this. And I think really in eighth grade I made it certain just to let my parents know this was my plan. You know, I'm going to move to California or New York and I'm going to try to become an actor, and that they knew that from early on. And so when I started taking it very seriously in high school and they would see, you know, these productions that we put on and they would see how excited I would get about them, they were all about it when I mentioned to them that I wanted to take zero hour, where I'd go to school early, you know, to do an extra class and take correspondence, which was really homeschooling as well, just to graduate early so I could get out to L.A., you know, sooner than later.__EOS__ Well, they must have a lot of faith in you and in your ability to follow through on the dream.__EOS__ Yeah. I know it's and, you know, obviously I couldn't have done this without them and it's incredible, very, very blessed.__EOS__ So you get to LA and then what? You don't know anybody there. Like, You don't, I mean....",3
51598," That is in fact my daughter's room and it's one of the few moments where the black and white makes me sad because it is pink.__EOS__ And you can tell, though, it's pink.__EOS__ Well, the great thing about shooting in your own home is location scouting means walking around with a cup of tea going, hmm. And my daughter had that big doll house with those Barbies in it. So that was a perfect place for him to sit down in resignation when he finds out that Claudio wants to get married.__EOS__  But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?",1
51599," What an odd sport. So you write about probiotics in your book. And, you know, we've talked on FRESH AIR about one of the ways doctors are - you know, scientists are experimenting now with creating the right bacterial balance in your gut is the transplantation of fecal material.__EOS__ Well, just on the topic of fecal transplants, which is a form of probiotics, a very extreme form of probiotics, and in fact I observed one, and it isn't - at the time it was not - it's not dried. It's certainly not sterilized.__EOS__ Yeah, and I think my attempt to make it less gross-sounding in my description, I totally sanitized the process in a way that you couldn't do it without killing the good-guy bacteria. So thank you for giving a far more accurate description of the transplant. And...__EOS__ Well, eventually they - I was going to say that eventually the hope is to make a - somehow make a pill form. I mean you can freeze bacteria. You can - eventually it will be a more standardized and less gross technique. But right now it's very simple  Take it out of Person A and put it into Person B.",3
51600," My mother was very important in my life, my late mother. She could not read or write, but she sent me to school. She supervised my homework. I remember the constant question she'd always ask me, even when I got 100 percent in anything. She'd still ask me whether that was the best I had. She was very fascinated with the best that I could have done. And in every situation, she comes to my mind. It's like I see her all the time as someone who's watching me, all the time, when I'm trying my best, under whatever circumstances I might be in, whether in jail, in exile or whether under attack.__EOS__ Well, for those who are not fortunate enough to have such a mother, do you have some wisdom, perhaps, that you could share with us?__EOS__ It isn't a wisdom, but actually a reality. When whatever forces put you down, you don't stay down, because if you stay down, you're fulfilling their wishes. To me, this is very, very, very important. I tell my children all the time  When life knocks you down, don't stay there. Rise up again. Keep on trying. To me, this is very, very important. Yeah.__EOS__ That was author, playwright and scholar Ngugi wa Thiong'o. His latest book, a memoir, is called ""In the House of the Interpreter.""

51603," Old number nine, the ninth son-in-law.__EOS__ Oh. .__EOS__ I wasn't the first guy to come through to marry one of the pretty Cash girls or the Carter girls that didn't work out. So I think from day one there was an understanding that he was my chief and my boss and my mentor. But when I became the son-in-law, that was a completely different room. That lived in a different room. But we kept our professional relationship totally separate. And after Cindy and I were divorced, you know, he was mad at me for five minutes. And then he got over it. And we got together and played the guitar and never said a word about it. And to the day he died - we actually became next-door neighbors. Connie and I lived next door to John and June. So we were friends till the day he died.__EOS__ Well, just a few days before he died, you took his photo. And that photo is in your book that collects your photos. And it's a beautiful photo.",2
51604," So in one of the - the special senate primary, T.W. Shannon, who is the speaker of the Oklahoma - former speaker of the Oklahoma house, an African-American Republican, was running for the nomination and for the Republican Party. And he eventually ended up losing in that particular race to a Republican congressman from the state as well. And so it was really interesting, I don't think people thought that the race was going to end up being as decisive as it was. People anticipated a runoff and Shannon only got about a third of the vote. It's actually interesting to look at the counties where he did win outright or win a plurality and a lot of those places either had larger than average black populations or larger than average Native American populations. I think some people thought with the success of somebody like Tim Scott in South Carolina that we were seeing the resurgence of African-American Republicans. And while I think that we are increasingly going to see more African-American Republican nominees and actual elected officials, whether we're talking about members of Congress or senator, even at the state level, you know, we still see that there is still plenty of room and progress to be made there and still many glass ceilings to crack at various levels.__EOS__ Interesting. We are going to hear from Tim Scott in just a few minutes. We're going to talk a little bit about something else. He's become an important conservative voice on the whole question of poverty and how poverty should be addressed. We're going to hear from him a little later. Charlie, the - what about the whole question of the state of the tea party and whether it still remains a force in American politics? Did we learn anything?__EOS__ Well, I think overall it was not - if you're keeping score at home, it was not a great night for the Tea Party. Chris McDaniel was sort of its signature candidate in Mississippi and Cochran was probably the Tea Party's last, best remaining chance to take down an incumbent. They have a couple of opportunities coming up but not as - they are not as well-positioned as in Mississippi. But I mean, I think, you know, the ideas of writing the Tea Party's obit, it misses the mark. The Tea Party, you know, at least in my estimation, is definitely not dead. You can still see it leaving its mark in elections - in House elections - in open seat house elections in particular. You see it leaving its mark in moving the party to the right and on Capitol Hill. But I do think what we're now discovering about the Tea Party is - we're beginning to see the outlines of the outer limits of what they can accomplish. Meaning, for example, incumbents no longer get caught sleeping the way they used to. And I think another change that you see is that Republicans and their supporters in the business community now understand that they can't sit back. They are taking on the Tea Party head on, in a way that they were much more reticent about doing in the 2012 election cycle. So I think you're beginning to see almost a maturing of the fight between the two. And so I don't think that this is the end, in any way, for Tea Party.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, we're talking about the primaries that took place earlier this week, and we're talking about what the headlines are from those. With us are Charles Mahtesian, he's a senior political editor for NPR and Andra Gillespie is a professor of political science at Emory University. So Professor Gillespie, one person generating buzz - you talked a little about kind of the rising class, if we could call it that, of African-American politics. That next wave, Maryland's Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown is now poised to become the first African-American governor of that state. That's because, you know, the Democrats are so dominant in Maryland and the winner of the Democratic primary is usually, you know, heavily advantaged in the fall. Tell us a little bit about Anthony Brown if you would. And is his a career that is worth watching and if so, why?",3

51606,"  So when Electricity invited the audience to learn the Star Exercise, the entire crowd of yogis, rockers and rabbis alike got up out of their chairs, stretched their limbs into a starfish position and took 108 breaths of fire together. __EOS__  After the last exhales, Ya Ho Wa 13 launched into one of their famously unrehearsed sets of spontaneous music.  As Djin the Aquarian played his guitar with an eagle feather, Electricity danced by the fire exit.   __EOS__  A few days later they'd all be gone. __EOS__ This is Jen, who works at National Public Radio, who has been recording us.

You've got a sound that is him. And that's rare. You - just a couple of seconds and you know who that is. Not only who it is but kind of how he is. __EOS__ A leading saxophonist on the edge of jazz since the '90s, Greg Osby admires Rollins for his instrumental command and his freedom. ",2

51610," Yeah... __EOS__ Sitting in front of thousands of people like that, belting out your music. __EOS__ Yeah. And I tell you I love to hear sing together. I think it's great. And - but I found playing in smaller places, just solo piano, people were so willing to sing. And it was a very church-like, just without the preacher part, you know? So, yeah, I started to sort of conduct and encourage the stuff that I thought was the most musical. And now it's stuck to this day, people still do it and people, I think, are meant to sing. That's just something that just comes up. It's in every culture. __EOS__ Yeah. ",2
51611," Yeah. What was it about George Burn's toupee in that movie? __EOS__ Oh, George had a toupee. And I said to him, George, God wouldnt wear a toupee. He said to me, well, I have to. I'm not going to appear without my hair. I'm just not going to do it. I said, well, how about hats?

I was surprised it took so long.__EOS__ You wanted to sing a song to the committee, right?__EOS__ I think I did. They questioned me about a song. I said, well, that's a good song, I'll sing it to you. No, they didn't want me to sing it. They wanted to know where I had sung it, at the following place.

You're just paying attention to the other voice and that other melody.

When I'm singing ""Standing in the Rain,"" it ain't about having a good time.

A little canape and cocktail frank is not necessarily going to break down the wall of mistrust that we have with Republicans.__EOS__ Yeah, I guess what - the interesting thing to me about this is that as you describe it, it isn't just that, it might - that it wouldn't work to have folks over for drinks who are out to get you, but that Obama in some sense sort of fundamentally didn't believe that this is what he ought to be doing, that people ought to be doing the right things for the right reasons, not because they're friends with somebody.__EOS__ Right after the Obamas got to the White House, they held their first Super Bowl party, and they - first they invited personal friends, and then they decided to include a couple people from Congress and some officials. They included some wounded veterans, and the president got to the party, and he wasn't at all unfriendly, he greeted everybody, but as soon as the game started, he went up to the front of the room, and he sat in a chair that was labeled for him, and he watched the game.__EOS__ Look, it's a point of pride for him that he's going to be a regular guy and watch the Super Bowl like a normal human being and not, you know, sort of be  on and be schmoozing at every moment.",3

Or send us email, talk@npr.org. I'm Rebecca Roberts. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. __EOS__ This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Rebecca Roberts. __EOS__ Thank you. I'm wondering about developmental disabilities.  Excuse me. My husband was diagnosed with Asberger's syndrome, or high-functioning autism, less than a year ago - basically because I finally hit the wall and realized that he was dependent on me. __EOS__ And Janet, do you think that had he gotten a diagnosis younger, it would have been a different outcome? ",0
51624," I think the title of the book begs the question about how bad you think things are. So give it to us straight with no chaser. Why does America's reputation need restoration? __EOS__ Well, I do think that this has been one of the worst presidencies that we've had in terms of what it has done to America's reputation. I loved representing the United States. There was nothing that made me prouder than to sit behind a sign that said United States, and I'm proud of America. But I think that what has happened and primarily around Iraq, has given us a bad reputation. Most people my age when around the world, if you say America to them, might think about Omaha Beach or the Marshall Plan. If you were to say America to the majority of the world's population that are younger, they would think Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. And that really encapsulates what the problem is. We've lost our moral authority. __EOS__ You also talk about, well you talk about two things. One is, you talk about the performance of this administration in your view, but you also talk about sort of historical trends that represent challenges for the U.S. anyway. So I'd like to isolate those in turn. First you say that the pre-eminence of American power remains among the major facts of 21st century life, but our ability to control events through the use of that power has eroded. Why is that? __EOS__ Take Iraq, for example. I do think our military has performed brilliantly in Iraq, and there's every reason to believe that militarily, the surge has worked. But we are not in control of the political situation inside Iraq. We can only tell Prime Minister Maliki to do so many things. We certainly are not in control of the various factions within Iraq, and we're not in control of the neighbors of Iraq. And it's just one example of, no matter how powerful are or how good our intentions are or are military is, you can't control all the outside events. And that's true whether you're dealing with China or Russia or Ecuador. ",3
51625," Because of their bonnets... __EOS__ Because of their bonnets, right. And... __EOS__ Which are almost like blinders and shut out... __EOS__ They really are. We used the real size ones and they come out a foot on either side. But also, you know, if you're traveling seven to 12 miles a day and you have a wide screen, you can really see what tomorrow is and what yesterday was, and I really wanted to keep you right with the immigrants. So it worked - and also just aesthetically I thought the bonnets of the wagons and the bonnets of the women all looked really beautiful in this square frame, which gives you a lot more foreground and gives you space over the mountains, which to me is a really nice way to photograph the desert. Which I should say, Robert Adams, you know, did this book ""The American West,"" which is a more '70s, you know, man's footprint in the West. But those photos were all in the square and those were kind of inspiring to me, looking at the desert in that format. ",1
51626,"  Many war stories might end there, but Michael Phillips' book is      unusual as war stories go.  It goes beyond the battlefield to chronicle      the battle to save Jason's Dunham's life. __EOS__  The doctors took a look at him in triage and decided that      he was not going to make it.  And they put him aside in what they call      the expectant ward, which in this case was a washroom.  And they assigned      people to sit with him.  There were dental technicians, a psychologist, a      chaplain, and they sat with him for 45 minutes as he was in a coma and      waited for him to stop breathing.  And he was a very well-built guy, did      a lot of muscle building, that sort of thing.  And so he was sort of      flopping over the side of the stretcher, and they thought, `God, he      really looks uncomfortable.'  And so they thought, `Well, we'll try to      strap in his arms so that he doesn't fall.' And as they did that, Heidi      Craft, the psychologist, was holding Jason's hand. And just as they were      doing that, he squeezed her hand and pulled her down to his chest.  And      you have to remember, at this point, Jason had not done anything      resembling voluntary motion.  He was in the deepest of comas.  And she      said, `Oh, my God, he squeezed my hand.' __EOS__  They spent eight days trying to save his life but ultimately... __EOS__  What happened was they evacuated him from Baghdad into      Germany to the...

But, specifically with respect to our kids, you know, if you're a mom you need to role model and show them what kindness and empathy and inclusion.

She fought to end the barriers that denied American citizens their rights purely on the basis of sex, and she demanded rights that not one of us would be willing to give up.

51641," One of the things you used to carry with you when you were in Iraq working on the Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit was the rosary of your dead Aunt Mary and a scapular.

If I did give her $2,000 for that, she would have eventually found out that I ripped her off, and she would have told everybody for the rest of her life that don't go to that store. They will rip you off. And just through that six degrees of separation everybody in the world would know it. And... __EOS__ Yeah. So Rick Harrison buys $13,000 worth of goodwill or good karma or something. __EOS__ And I believe it works, because I'm sure that lady right there will be worth her weight in gold in advertising because she will tell everybody for the rest of her life what I did for her.

It's crazy. The record was, you know, we put together this record. It was really a great way to learn the material and create a way to play together as duo partners. And it really came together and we made a real effort to keep the tunes really concise and straight to the point. But we don't feel that way when it comes time to do a live performance.

Now when we got to Big Fence, we found pretty much all of the adult women on the island gathered there to speak to us, and what they wanted to tell us was, with these trials of seven men just about to start, it was all a load of rubbish. No one had ever been abused on Pitcairn. No child had been raped. No girl had been abused. __EOS__ Apart from the content, what they were telling you, I'm wondering, what kind of impression did you have of these women, I mean, just their general affect and demeanor?

And when the family left Russia, the family piano had to stay behind. It was a small brown upright, a Petra. __EOS__ Yes, so I'm so sad, it's still - it never and never ever stops being less sad. But it's sad on so many levels. My mom, she entered a conservatory when she was 16. Her dad, my grandfather, he gave her that piano as a present for entering the conservatory and she'd had it all through her piano life. I had that piano near me as long as, you know, my memory extends, like it was always there. ",3

It was that close. __EOS__ The surgeons did not easily find the bullet to remove it, and in fact considered leaving in the president's body. __EOS__ Well, often these  in these injuries you do leave bullets in bodies, because they're benign. They don't go anywhere. In this case the surgeon had two implications. One, he didn't want it migrating somewhere else. That could cause trouble. And two, he envisioned, as he's hunting for this bullet, he's about to give up, he's like maybe I'll just leave it, he can't find it, he's squishing around in the lung, and it's like kind of moving around with his fingers, he can't find it... __EOS__ Now, when you say squishing around, he is literally holding the president of the United States's lung in his hands, trying to find the bullet.

51656," This is a B-movie experience I haven't heard of.__EOS__ It was - that was the nickname the theaters have. And I went to see these movies, and the way they transported me, the way they made me feel in awe of these gigantic creatures strolling across the ocean, coming into the city, it's unlike any Western movie genre ever. And moreover, there was an implicit code in watching these movies, even as a kid, where I knew they were miniatures. They were miniature cities, miniature planes, miniature tanks. So there was no real-life impact to me. They became spectacles, almost ballets of elemental creatures.__EOS__ I was going to ask about that because those older films, I mean, it's almost kind of laughable looking at some of the special effects, right?

It was the tip of the iceberg. I mean, really, it is remarkable how one person got picked out, and the entire stadium focused their ire on him and almost tried to kill him. I mean, it was really a shocking thing. I decided to do this film when I took a look at the film and saw just how furious that crowd was and how they're trying to rip him to pieces for really doing the most innocent thing that a fan can do in a baseball game, which is to reach out and try to catch a ball. __EOS__ And as you point out, as the film shows over and over again, he's hardly the only one who reached out for that ball. ",1
51660," Yes. __EOS__ And you've talked about how there were times that you really wished it was over because you were so unhappy, just like so miserable. And so, when you were threatened by the idea of somebody else killing you, did it make you feel any differently about life? __EOS__ Look, I mean, the time that I tried to commit suicide, that had everything to do with the crazy amount of cocaine I was doing. That, combined with the fact that I was already sort of having a nervous breakdown because I tried to quit liquor cold turkey to cure an ulcer that I had. And I was in this little apartment in L.A. I had to get up that day for a network character reading, 11 different sketches.  __EOS__ Artie, I really want to wish you the best in all ways and thank you so much for coming back to Fresh Air and talking with us.

But reports were people were beaten. There were people shot. People were actively chased. __EOS__ Have you heard reports of any protesters being killed today? ",3
51662," To me it can be. To be honest with you, you know, when you're dealing with truth and you're dealing with jokes trying to get a view point across, yeah, it can be tricky. One thing about my jokes is like you don't feel any type of anger or like malice in my voice, you know, I'm just giving you my perspective, you know.__EOS__ But why do you think comedy still seems so segregated, though? Do you know what I mean? If you go and see African-American comics you'll see some white people there. But in similarly with white comics, you'll see some black people there. But do you share my observation about this?__EOS__ It depends on the comedian. My audience is diverse so I don't know if people are getting on my train, you know, from MTV or was it ""Fast Lane"" or ""Any Given Sunday,"" or ""How To Be A Player."" I mean there's a lot of things that I've done that I've gained momentum. But what's cool about ""Crazy, Sexy, Dirty"" is all those fans are seeing me as a grown man and what my perspective is right now.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. We're continuing our Make Me Laugh summer series with comedian Bill Bellamy. His latest show was just on Showtime. It's called ""Crazy, Sexy, Dirty."" And I think one of the kind of the classic subjects for comedians is the differences between the sexes, right? And this is certainly something that you talk about in ""Crazy, Sexy, Dirty."" And here's one example.",1
51663," The Civil War was fought of course, and the slaves were ultimately freed at the end of the war. African-Americans were granted full citizenship through changes in the constitution. The question was what was going to happen with women and she wasn't happy taking a backseat to African Americans. __EOS__ Well, I would phrase that somewhat differently if I may. African American men were granted the rights of citizens and African American women, of course, weren't. And there were differences among abolitionists in the North about this. Do we hold out for the, as I say, the fullest possible suffrage for all adult Americans, or just do we end the current emergency with terrible news of racial violence coming north? Do we give the black community in some form the voting rights that we're able to gain for them in the current political climate? And it's the political fight that we can - many of us can relate to. Do we hold out for the biggest possible thing or do we recognize the emergency of the moment and get rights or the tool of political power for whatever groups we can? __EOS__ She even argued that, if I'm not mistaken, that it could be harmful to women to allow themselves to be placed under, in some sense, the rule of black men, were black men to be given the vote. __EOS__ Yeah, there were some comments about what will we and our daughters suffer if these degraded black men are allowed to have the rights that would make them even worse than our Saxon fathers. She has one, I think, inexplicable comment about black women would find an even worse slavery under black men than they did under their former white slave owners, which is not a comment that she got from any black woman. ",0
51664," through all the pages of ""The Wealth of Nations."" __EOS__ Well, thank you. And thank you for having me on. And I just want to clear up, I am not going to write the rest of the series. One book that changed the world is just plenty. __EOS__ Well, the others - the Koran, the Bible, Thomas Paine - there's a bunch of them. What, you get the short straw? __EOS__ Yeah, I guess I did. It was - Toby Mundy is the editor of the British branch of Grove/Atlantic Press. And Toby asked me to write this, and I needed to money, and I thought, gee, 900 pages. How bad can it be? I read good. I was an English major. ",0
51665," Police came in the next day and just took them. __EOS__ So the lady who lost her earrings gets them back. The miscreant gets prosecuted. Justice is served, but you're out the money. __EOS__ I'm out the money and it's the price of paying - doing business. That's the way I look at it. __EOS__ All right. Now the other thing that you've got to do is figure out when somebody is trying to pass off a fake. So I guess you get pretty good. One of the things you see a lot is Rolex watches. How can you tell a fake Rolex watch? ",3
51666," Well, this goes back to the early days of rock and roll in the ‘50s, where, you know, what would happen at concerts was really a rebellion against the rule you were supposed to sit down and just passively watch things. __EOS__ Let's get Solomon on the line. Solomon also calling from Portland, Oregon. __EOS__ Hello. __EOS__ Hi, ",0
51667," Just as importantly, Washington didn't insist on standing in power as general, either. __EOS__ Yes. Exactly. __EOS__ And that was a tremendous lesson, as well. And I love your juxtaposition with the founders - and Washington, in particular - with what, by contrast, happened with the demise of the Roman Republic. Thank you so much. I look forward to reading your book. __EOS__ Thank you. ",0
51668," There's another part of this. Obviously, you weren't given the kind of access that you could go into this community and shoot it from the inside. __EOS__ No. We do reveal a bitter truths. We have footage - we have sermons from Warren Jeffs. We have photos of Warren Jeffs that have never been seen from his personal collection. And we do reveal a lot of truths, and it is crime. They are committing crimes. There are girls being systematically raped. There are boys that are being sent to job sites at eight years old. __EOS__ Warren Jeffs, you mentioned the notorious and now incarcerated leader and prophet of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. __EOS__ How easy it is for the prophet to see when a parent is with him or against him. If your children don't grow up in faith and it's your fault, you will have to suffer for their sins along with them, and there is no redemption for you. ",1
51669," So it's the size title that you didn't choose. __EOS__ , I'll say. And secondly, I did not endorse nor would I ever endorse a perpetual copyright, because in the Constitution it says, for limited times. And as an originalist, I don't screw around with the Constitution. My idea was to extend another 10 or 20 years so that it would benefit grandchildren, as well as children. __EOS__ Let me ask you about your book because you then - you have just written this new book called ""Digital Barbarism."" And you argue that the first target of what you call the barbarians is copyright and the individual voice. And I would like to ask you a little bit, who are you identifying, or why you identifying as barbarism, and who are the barbarians? __EOS__ I mean... ",0
51670,"  We're not Mormons or old-timey people. We don't exactly have a way of life, babe.__EOS__  You know what I mean.__EOS__  It's a brave new world, honey. There are test-tube babies and surrogate babies, and ""Jon and Kate Plus Eight."" I don't think that two friends having a kid together because it might be her last chance is the worst thing that I ever heard.__EOS__ Maya Rudolph, welcome to FRESH AIR. It's a pleasure to have you here. So you play the mother of two in ""Friends with Kids."" There was a time, I think, when actresses dreaded reaching the age when they were cast in the mother roles because those roles were unlikely to either be interesting or to be central to the movie. Think that's changing?",3
51671," I'm speaking with Lupe Fiasco. He's a man Jay-Z called the most creative rapper in the business. His new record is called ""Lasers."" __EOS__  It's so loud inside my head with words that I should've said... __EOS__ The latest single from this new record is called ""Words I Never Said."" And it's a political song, but it's also a very personal song. It's a song in which you address your Muslim faith. Let's take a listen. __EOS__  Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it. But if we know better, then we probably deserve it. Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship? Murdering is not Islam and you are not observant... ",2
51672," Yeah, that's right, he never goes out of character. __EOS__ And he never goes out of character. So here you are, you know, walking through the jungle with him, and you're both out of character here. You're not - but - so you're just talking as yourself, but he's still, you know, quote, ""talking black"" because he never gets out of character. And what you're talking about is the ""Simple Jack"" role, and so this ended up being a very controversial scene because of the use of the word ""retarded."" So I just want to warn our listeners, for anybody who finds that word, like, really, you know, insulting, that this is a comedy. This is a parody. You know it's an insulting word, and you're using it - you, the writer-director of this movie, are using it knowing that. So here's the scene. __EOS__  There were times when I was doing Jack that I actually felt retarded, like really retarded. I mean, I brushed my teeth retarded. I rode a bus retarded. __EOS__  Damn. ",1
51673," Well, dining, and I put it in quotation marks, was really a code word for social equality. And the feeling was, certainly in the South, that if you invited a man to sit at your table, you were actually inviting him to woo your daughter. He should feel perfectly comfortable asking your daughter to marry him. And so that's, you know, really the primary reason why people were so offended. It just shouldn't happen in 1901 that a black man would be able to, you know, have that entree into your family.__EOS__ A week afterwards, the president was with Booker T. Washington. They both attended the same event. It was at Yale University, Washington in the audience, Roosevelt on the stage, they are - the president introduced by Supreme Court Justice David Brewer, who surprised the crowd, you write, by tackling the dinner head on. Looking in T.R.'s direction, he said, I'm glad there is one man in the United States who knows a true Washington, whether he is a George or a Booker.__EOS__ Yes. And the crowd went crazy. Honestly, Yale was completely unprepared to have paparazzi and, you know, journalists hounding Roosevelt and Booker T. Washington while they were there, just wanting some comment about this dinner. And in a very funny way, Booker T. Washington's eating habits became an obsessive topic in the country. Everybody wanted to know who he was eating with, where he was eating. The poor man was probably tempted to start fasting.__EOS__ And it's interesting, you talk about the criticism in the South, and obviously, there was some support in the North, but African-American newspapers in the South were critical of Booker T. Washington.",0
51674,"  Thank you.  __EOS__  I don't know how much of the comments from Willie you were able to hear, but just what is your initial reaction to her description of what is taking place in Harlem?   __EOS__  Well, first of all, I think that gentrification brings about the inevitable cultural clashes, and certainly we have seen that play out in Harlem in rather heated and adversarial situations.  One in particular that has made headline news not only throughout this country but throughout the world is that of the drummers who have gathered traditionally for over four or five decades in the Marcus Garvey Park, which is located at 124th just off Fifth Avenue.  And Fifth Avenue and, of course, 125th constitutes part of the commercial thoroughfare of 125th Street, which is now the subject of a massive rezoning program that will alter not only Harlem's physical landscape, but also dramatically impact its socioeconomic makeup as well as its ethnic make-up.   __EOS__  Let me stop you, let me stop you there just to say I understand what you're describing, but I want to make sure we get in some of the other points. ",3
51675," . All right, let's go to Jack. He's calling from Michigan. Hi, Jack. __EOS__ Hi. How's everybody this afternoon? __EOS__ Well, we're having a good time. Thanks. __EOS__ Happy Memorial Day. ",0
51676," Well, you know, that's been the problem since day one. You know, General Eisenhower when he moved into the Pentagon as Army chief of staff after the war, the first time that he was off by himself and tried to find his way back to his office, he suddenly realized that he was hopelessly lost, and he wandered around with his hands in his pockets, trying to pretend he was out for a stroll. Finally, he quietly approached this group of stenographers and asked one of them  Could you tell me where the chief of staff's office is? And the lady said  General Eisenhower, you just passed your door 10 feet back and… __EOS__ …story will soon spread over the entire Pentagon. Eisenhower remarked that they had to give the designers their due they've made sure no enemy could ever infiltrate the Pentagon. __EOS__ We crossed through the courtyard and enter another part of the innermost A-Ring. It's bustling with activity - uniformed men and women carry on conversations that rattle off the cement walls. __EOS__ Yeah, they had pretty amazing conditions when they first moved in April 30th of 1942. I mean this is, you know, basically about seven - seven and a half months after groundbreaking, and they went into a building, which was completely open to the elements, so you have clouds of dust, were rolling through the building. There was water, sawdust everywhere. The first workers called themselves the plank walkers because they have to walk across planks of lumber that were strewed over the construction site over the mud and muck to just get to the building and a lot of them ended up keeping pieces of lumber underneath their desks because there was water just streaming into the building from rain storms and that sort of thing was happening quite a bit. It was just a chaotic scene but there was a feeling that there was no time to waste, they needed space and people were moving in. ",0
51677," Oh. I see. I see. OK.__EOS__ It was a repair job.  Yeah.__EOS__ So that year that you had the accident and you were hospitalized, I think that was the same year that your older - one of your older sisters died of a heart condition.__EOS__ Yeah, she died on my 13th birthday. So it's around that time. Yeah.",2
51678," And went to the State University of New York at Purchase, yeah. __EOS__ So, I'm trying to figure out where did you play Felix Unger in ""The Odd Couple""? __EOS__ I did that in Florida, yeah. That was one of the school plays that we did. __EOS__ Okay. So, it was a school play? ",1
51679," Right.__EOS__ I mean, do you find that disturbing at all?__EOS__ Yeah, I think it's totally disturbing. I feel very lucky that I grew up before Facebook and before Internet porn. I - it's such tough territory to navigate now. And I'm just dealing with guys that came up on the end of it, where they just were exposed to it. You know, they're in their 30s, and some of them have a lot of trouble with it. And there's new addictions because of it and these new expectations on these girls.__EOS__ So there's another sketch I want to play, and this is - this is a real girl thing. It's a sketch about how girls handle compliments from other girls. And this sketch starts with two girlfriends running into each other on the street, and Amy Schumer enters the scene a little bit later.",3
51680,"  How are we going to deal with this?__EOS__  We take them on, one at a time.__EOS__ And if that trailer is to be believed, this is familiar territory. Monsters chase men, men die and, occasionally, things blow up. Except, having seen this movie, I can say it's no more about wolves than ""Jaws"" is about a shark. It's about how we live our lives - the choices we make, and the mistakes and regret that can stalk us all. Go figure.__EOS__ Thank you, Audie. Thank you for having me.",1
51681," Well, after we left Libya my father became a very vocal opponent to the Gadhafi regime, and we lived in Egypt, which was a safe place for people who were on the wrong side of the Libyan dictatorship, up to the late '80s when they started to become friends, but also they realized that they could help each other. __EOS__ The Mubarak dictatorship in Egypt and the Gadhafi dictatorship in Libya. __EOS__ Absolutely. And one of the things that they did was to hand over dissidents that were residing in each other's countries, so my father was a victim of that. He was kidnapped by the Egyptian Secret Services and he effectively disappeared. __EOS__ Could your father still be alive in Libya somewhere? ",0
51682,"  Very few administrators have gone through what I've been      through with two wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and then the genocide in      Darfur, the reconstruction of southern Sudan, the massive increase in      spending in Africa, and now that we've just gotten money in the last few      days to begin to set up defenses around the world against avian flu      breaking out. __EOS__  That's not to mention the bureaucratic battles he fought and      lost. The Bush administration's most high-profile aid programs were set      up outside his agency.  A new government corporation runs the so-called      Millennium Challenge Account, a multibillion-dollar aid program to help      countries that govern well, and the president put his HIV-AIDS      coordinator in the State Department.  Patrick Cronin, a former USAID      official now with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says      the agency looks to be dying a slow death. __EOS__  USAID continues to have the best expertise on      development in the US government, and yet nobody will dispute that it's      lost its primacy in development assistance some time ago.  So what we've      seen since the '90s is the strengthening of the State Department's policy      leadership role in foreign development assistance.  The Bush      administration took that with a vengeance. __EOS__  Some development experts who want to see USAID remain      independent and development assistance untainted by politics are worried      the Bush administration will try to merge the agency into the State      Department.  Larry Nowels of the Congressional Research Service says it's      something Republicans have tried before, in part because some distrust      the bureaucracy, but there's also a new reason. ",3
51683," As you said, several men were sentenced to prison terms but they ended up not serving very long. And they are now released and the island goes on. How have the scandal and the trials changed Pitcairn Island? __EOS__ In some ways, a great deal, mainly because the emergence of the scandal, I think, shamed the British government into realizing that they had neglected this place for two centuries and that they better do something about it now. In a material sense, firstly a lot of the infrastructure has been upgraded, the roads - one of the roads has been sealed and they've got a rebuilt jetty and - and so on. So that side of things, plus communications - they have now got television, including CNN. __EOS__ Do you think the abuse continues or has it stopped? __EOS__ I don't think the abuse continues right now, because once it came - once the allegations were first made a few years back, the first thing that Britain did was to send police officers to the island, and social workers, and also a government representative. So for the past 10 years, there has been quite a number of outsiders on the island and I don't believe that any of the men there would be so silly as to engage in that kind of behavior when they are being supervised so closely. However, I also believe that if those outsiders were to go away tomorrow, that behavior would start again straight away because it's ingrained in the mentality of the men of Pitcairn, that this is - this is an okay thing to do, you know. There's - there's nothing wrong with it and, you know, that's what you do if you can. ",0
51684," You wrote an article about sexual violence in prison that is one of your best-known articles. And I think that one won an award, didn't it? __EOS__  It did, the George Polk Award, and it was also nominated for a National Magazine Award. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. So when you got into general population, you're relatively short. What did you do to protect yourself as a small man entering general population? Yeah. __EOS__ Well, the first thing is I was looking for a weapon. In fact, when I went before the initial classification board, the chief of security told me that, you know, he asked if knew anybody. I said no. And he said, well, you've got to get you a weapon, and either that or go into a protective custody cell. ",0
51685," Oh, I see. So that's exactly what I'm talking about. And so I started to think about home and I started to miss home. And I started to have those feelings that I realized that millions of Irish people had had over the generations. And I started to count the days - I was going home at the end of it.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Colm Toibin and his new novel is called ""The Testament of Mary."" Let's take a short break and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is writer Colm Toibin. He's the author of several novels, including ""Brooklyn"" and the new novel ""The Testament of Mary."" I think a lot has been written about the immigration at the beginning of the 20th century from the potato famine, immigration from Ireland to the United States.__EOS__ Yes. Every family in the town I'm from, people went to England or America. Now, people really stopped going to America in the '50s, but they went in the '30s and '40s. The big difference with going to America is that often you never came home at all. But the other difference was that the - America was viewed as glamorous, as a land of opportunity whereas England was viewed as a land where you would always be a second-class citizen.",0
51686," ""More Things that I Hate""?__EOS__ This is going to be the ""50 Shades of Grey"" of hatred.__EOS__ Well, good for you.__EOS__ I was going to call it, after my legs, ""48 Shades of Blue,"" but I figured I'll stick with - I'll stick with what I have because it's so politically correct now. Everybody is so uptight to say anything. So I started making jokes about everything to my friends, and one of them said  Just jot it down. There's a book in this.",0
51687," Exactly. It won for worst security. __EOS__ And worst security as well. Let's take another call. This is Lauren in Lafayette, California. Hello, Lauren. How are you? __EOS__ Good. How are you? __EOS__ All right, what's your story? ",0
51688," Now you're also the Right Reverend Al Green. __EOS__ Absolutely. __EOS__ Still acting in a Full Gospel Tabernacle Church in Memphis, Tennessee. __EOS__ Absolutely. ",2
51689," Do you feel like you can understand that point of view in a way, because there have been - I mean there have been secrets that we find out only decades later when the Freedom of Information Act files are open. We find out about lies the government taught us, secrets they kept from us. __EOS__ Right. Right. Right. Right. __EOS__ So it's... __EOS__ Right. No, I - yeah. ",3
51690," A good film is a good writing, first and foremost, because the writer starts with a blank page. And those words have to capture an imagination of a director, somebody like myself - producers, actors. And I think a good film is something that moves you, and something that entertains you, and something that, you know, enhances your understanding of life. __EOS__ But what makes the difference between you saying yes to a project and I'd love to but I can't? __EOS__ It's the quality of the scripts that I get. It's all about reading. People say to me all the time  How can I get in the movie business or how do I get there, how can I have your job? And I just say, you know, I had an unfortunate accident. When I was a 10-year-old kid, I played cowboys and Indians. I was on the losing side of a guy who had like, kind of a musket, like a Davey Crockett musket, and he poked my eye out. __EOS__ Do you read the magazine articles about you? ",1
51691," And you go back to see your family in Provence? __EOS__ Yes. Not often enough, unfortunately, but of course it's a wonderful region. And my leaving it wasn't a rejection of the culture or the area or anything like this. It was more of a sense of lack of membership. __EOS__ Ceased to matter? You were moving from one tenement to another and in New York City for a year, it sounds like, you were the ultimate non-member when you came to New York as I read it. __EOS__ Yes, but in a way, that's probably the best path to finding yourself and to creating an environment that's propitious to realizing your potential. ",0
51692," So just one more thing. Is it helpful to be in good shape when you're playing an elderly man who is not in good shape and is very stooped over and can barely, like, walk and kind of shuffles?__EOS__ You have to be in better shape to do that than not good shape. Because it takes endurance to do it take after take after take. And therefore you've got to be in shape to do that. And, yeah, I slowed down a little. Yeah, I've had a lot of injuries as a runner. Do they all go into Woody? Yeah. Whatever handicaps Bruce has, Woody has. But you have to be in really good condition to pull that off for seven weeks.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ In minus nine degrees...",1
51693," My older sister who's 19 years older than me, and she looks like my mother more, you know, almost. __EOS__ Exactly. Do you have children now? __EOS__ I have two boys. I had my tubes tied when I was 30 so I wouldn't make that mistake. __EOS__ Obviously, you feel strongly about it. ",3
51694," But what is the message, do you think, for people who believe that radical change is necessary in the way our nation delivers its educational opportunities to children? What is the message? Is the message one of personality, which is that you have to have a certain kind of personality to get the buy-in? Or is it the fact that people don't truly accept that radical change is needed? What is the take-away, do you think, from what happened here? __EOS__ Yeah, I think that's a good question. I don't think that anybody knows exactly the answer to that question yet, though. You know, how do you move forward aggressively with school reform but make sure that people are bought into it? __EOS__ I would like to ask you what role you think race played in this election and in what has occurred here. One of the curious things about the polling going into the election is that majorities of residents believe that the city is moving in the right direction, and that there have been improvements in the life of the city and the quality of life in the city and also in the schools. __EOS__ What role do you think race played in this? ",3
51695," It's always great talking to you. __EOS__ I'm so sorry to hear about your magazine. I just want to say, you know, I have a copy of your new book ""Gourmet Today"" sitting right next to me, and I just noticed that there's a little sticker on it saying  Bonus, a subscription to Gourmet Magazine is included with the purchase of this book. See back flap for offer. __EOS__ Oh, how sad. __EOS__ I know, it's very - there have been many ironies in this entire affair, one being that I was in the middle of a book tour for ""Gourmet Today,"" which is a wonderful cookbook and didn't deserve to have this happen to it, when, you know, I found out that the magazine was being closed. ",0
51696," So without giving away any detailed plot points, could you describe the central character, Nelson - he's an actor - and this theater troupe that he joins?__EOS__ Nelson is a - kind of a bookish young man growing up in a war-torn country. He's - decides at a very young age he wants to be a playwright, wants to be a storyteller and sort of pursues that dream. I shouldn't say - he doesn't pursue it with much diligence, in a sense that his dream is in some ways based on this fantasy and this notion that he's going to one day leave for the United States because his older brother has already moved to the United States. And there's this idea that this visa is dangling before him and it's going to sort of save him from making any tough decisions about adulthood.__EOS__ What's ""The Idiot President"" about, the play that you had them do?__EOS__ Well, ""The Idiot President"" is based on a play by a friend of mine named Walter Ventocia. He gave me the script, probably in 1999 or around then, and I adapted it and changed it. Basically, the president is joined by his idiot son and then a servant. And the premise of the play is that every citizen in the country is afforded the privilege of attending to the president each day. And they have to do his chores, they have to, you know, tie his boots, they have to read his correspondence, they have to basically play to his ego, which is enormous. And at the end of each day, the servant is sacrificed, is killed.",0

And this friend called me and said  They'd love to have you come and sing.__EOS__ So how did marriage equality become an important issue for you?__EOS__ For me, it's a civil rights cause, and I'm obviously a child of the civil rights. I'm a benefactor of the civil rights movement. You know, I'm getting married in October, and as recently as, you know, 1964, it would have been illegal for me to marry my fiancee because, you know, he's Caucasian and I am not.__EOS__ And your reaction when President Obama decided to support gay marriage publicly?",3
51698," Well, what would you rather hear, ""Promises, Promises"" or ""I'll Never Fall In Love Again""? I'm going to let you choose.__EOS__ ""I'll Never Fall In Love Again.""__EOS__ Let's hear it. This is Dionne Warwick.__EOS__  What do you get when you fall in love? A guy with a pin to burst your bubble That's what you get for all your trouble. I'll never fall in love again.

51700," We're talking with Robert Kaplan about his new book, ""The Revenge of Geography."" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.__EOS__ You said, in reference to Russia, that rivers that run north and south divide a country. Rivers that run east and west unite a country. Why is that so?__EOS__ Well, it's so in Russia's case because Russia extends over half the longitudes in the world. So it is desperately in need of something that unites European Russia and Far Eastern Russia. The rivers might have served that purpose had they run east and west, but because they don't, they infernally divide the country.__EOS__ And let me ask you about a concept you introduce in this book, the idea that many people - takes them aback for just a second, the idea that geography is changing. Wait a minute. There isn't any more or less land unless the sea rises much more rapidly than we think it is. Geography, you say, is changing on the basis of technology and urbanization and, of course, climate change.",0

I mean, the Bay Area always had a certain swagger about it, including the slang that people tend to be attracted to and follow behind. __EOS__ …own language. I mean, for years, we don' heard people say, the Bay Area language, the Bay Area lingo. When we say something, we like yadadamean? __EOS__ Mm hmm. __EOS__ Yadadamean means, do you understand? ",3
51702," And all that goodwill evaporated with this.__EOS__ Didn't mean a thing.__EOS__ You write about that quite a bit in the book. You write about Crown Heights extensively, but it's interesting. You point out three things that people tease you about. One is, you are very careful about your grammar. As you say, you love the King's English, you love tennis and you don't mind dressing up.__EOS__ No.",0
51703," Yeah.__EOS__ Yeah-yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.__EOS__ You know, it was like, a lot of times platinum, though. But, yeah, that.__EOS__ That's funny. That's right.",0
51704," Thank you.__EOS__ So long. Here's an e-mail from Alex in St. Louis. One song that inspires me is ""Give Peace a Chance"" by John Lennon because it tells us that the world - that our world needs peace to make it a better place and also tells us how we can make peace with one another. That from Alex in St. Louis. And of course, people take their inspiration from all kinds of artists, all kinds of puritan. It really is. Hip-hop is the music you grew up with? If you grew up with the music of the Beetles or with the music of James Brown, that might be the soundtrack to your life.__EOS__ Right. But I like the fact that, you know, a classic song can have relevance today, you know. A John Lennon song can have relevance today; a James Brown song can have relevance today. And I think that many of the hip-hop songs that I have in my book will have relevance from years from now as well.__EOS__ Indeed, in terms of hip-hop songs, you go back a ways, you mind the songs from when you were a kid, not just the songs that are around now.",2
51705," Well, yes. And I think, to be honest, it has to be this; that there were 70-odd million people in Germany who were convinced this was the right thing to do. Hitler was, by all accounts, a man of enormous charm. We sort of forget all these things at our peril. It's easy to make them just sort of comic book villains, and make them just out-and-out horrible people. I think if we are going to understand them, we have to recognize quite often who and what they were. I remember when I was an undergraduate lawyer, I discovered, to my shock and horror, how many of the people who were in the SS, for instance, had been lawyers - not just lawyers at the sort of bureaucratic end, but lawyers who were actually in charge of murder squads. The reality is if we're honest, it's true that almost every country has committed terrible crimes on enormous industrial level. Russia massacred millions of people, so did China during the cultural revolution, so did several European countries, including Great Britain. And dare I say the Americans with the massacre of the American Indians? That was a population decimated beyond recovery, it seems to me.__EOS__ Do you think in these books that you set up Bernie Gunther to be the kind of everyman, the real German?__EOS__ Yes. That was always my intention. Quite often, I'd paint him into a corner whereby we realize the sort of moral quandaries that would have faced most people. It's easy to imagine that we all behave in a heroic fashion. But I like to sort of - I mean, it certainly makes it more interesting from a writer's point of view when you're writing a novel to have a character who's not entirely good, who's ashamed of some of the things he's done. And he's always kind of haunted by memories of what he's seen and to some extent the memories of what he's done. He's aware of his own shortcomings.__EOS__ This is a kind of a dark sense of humor that you - where Bernie jokes about some of the things that he's done. This sort of darkness, is this a German thing, do you think?",0

51707,  You know where I can get a smoothie around here?__EOS__  I'm sorry. I...__EOS__  Sorry. I didn't hear what you said.__EOS__  I said I don't know where you'd get a smoothie around here at all. I'm so sorry.,1
51708," She does cop out. And that was part of why I found it so odd that people would get so upset over ""Society's Child"" because to me, the song had the ending that the conservatives or the people who didn't believe in mixing races wanted. So, I didn't understand why everybody was so bothered and making threats against me and threats against radio stations and what not. __EOS__ Maybe it was the album-cut length, that some people just didn't get to the end of the song and didn't... __EOS__ ...and didn't hear the end of the lyric. __EOS__ That was an argument. And I remember the record company wanting to know, couldn't we cut out the second verse? And I said, well, it won't make any sense. Sure, but it really won't make any sense. That was pretty funny. ",0
51709," Right, for a bomb like this, you have of a fissile material, like uranium or plutonium, surrounded by conventional explosives, and when the conventional explosives detonate, they compress the nuclear core. In this case, the weapon did not have a nuclear court in it. So there was no chance of a nuclear explosion, but the conventional explosives did detonate. And one of the themes of my book is about how we are so much better at creating complex technological systems then we are at controlling them. You know, a guy pulls the wrong handle and releases an atomic bomb over South Carolina. We're very lucky there wasn't a nuclear core in it because it would have detonated, and it wouldn't have been as large an explosion as in North Carolina. It would probably have been as large an explosion as the Hiroshima bomb. And that's pretty big explosion.__EOS__ In 1979 - by then a lot of our weapons are on missiles, and we had this system for detecting when there might be a Soviet attack. And the detection system sent some alarming signals to military commanders. What happened with that?__EOS__ Well, by the late 1970s, the great threat to the United States was Soviet missiles. And these would come very quickly. And so the president of the United States would not have very much time whether to decide if this is a real attack or a false alarm and whether to launch our missiles. It might be as few as 10, 12 minutes to make this decision. And at about 11 o'clock in the morning on November 9, 1979, at NORAD headquarters inside Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, Colorado, suddenly the screens were filled with images of a major Soviet attack on the United States. It really looked like an all-out attack and that the president might have to make a decision about whether to respond. It was investigated very quickly, and other radars showed no sign of this attack. The decision was made that this was a false alarm, and it was soon realized that someone had inadvertently put a training tape - and the training tape was of an all-out Soviet attack - into a computer. And the computer had presented the training tape as a real attack. So that was a false alarm. Nothing was done as a result of it. But on June 3, 1980, we had another serious, serious incident at 2 30 in the morning when Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security advisor, was awoken at 2 30 in the morning and told by his military aide, the United States was most likely under attack by 220 missiles. And Brzezinski said, I need confirmation of that. And his military aide got off the phone, and the military aid called back Brzezinski and said it's actually 2,200 Soviet missiles are coming towards the United States. And Brzezinski wanted further confirmation, and as he lay there in bed in the early morning hours, he decided not to wake up his wife because if Washington, D.C. was about to be destroyed, he preferred that she die in her sleep. And Brzezinski was preparing to call President Carter to talk about the American retaliation, in his military aide called back one more time, said it was a false alarm. And this false alarm was later traced to a faulty computer chip - a computer chip that cost 46 cents that had malfunctioned and had said this - had sent this signal that 2,000 Soviet missiles with their warheads were on the way.__EOS__ Eric Schlosser's book is ""Command and Control.""

51714," So, you wrote all but two songs on this CD.__EOS__ I did.__EOS__ What does it take for someone whose music is so often covered by others, to cover someone else's tune? For example, you've done your rendition here of Hoagy Carmichael's, ""Nearness of You.""__EOS__  It's not the pale moon that excites me, that thrills and delights me. Oh no, it's just the nearness of you. All right. Isn't your sweet conversation that brings this sensation. Oh no, it's just the nearness of you...",2
51715," And, by the way, I should say, in case people couldn't hear what he was saying  That's not funny if you have a deaf son. __EOS__ A deaf son. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ But that is funny because you  first of all, where are we going to start? I was doing a thing about noisy children, how I hate noisy children on an airplane. And then I said the only child I would like would be Helen Keller. It's a joke. I'm a comedian you paid $60 to make you laugh. It's a silly joke. ",1
51716," So did you do it?__EOS__ No, they didn't. I can't remember what happened. But I still remember how they looked at me with utter horror. And these were teenage boys.__EOS__ So, you know, when you can gross out your own teenage boys, I think that kind of says something about your family.__EOS__ Tess Gerritsen, it's been great to talk to you. Thank you so much.",0
51717," Stuff I had never seen.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ So it sounds, like, that Mike Myers making this movie about his dear friend Shep Gordon did not hurt the friendship.__EOS__ Strengthened it, if it could get stronger. I don't know if it can get stronger. If anything strengthened it.",1

51719," So you write about national security. You focus on terrorism, you've investigated al-Qaida for years. Are you worried about anti-Islam extremists in the U.S. and in Europe now? I mean it was an anti-Muslim extremist, a Christian anti-Muslim extremist, who killed I don't remember how many tens of people in Norway. And there is a wave of anti-Islamic sentiment in the United States. There are states that are trying to pass laws outlawing Sharia law, you know, with the assumption that the passage of Sharia law is a real threat in the United States. __EOS__ Yeah... __EOS__ So I just wonder if you're tracking that and what you make of it. __EOS__ I mean, I'm tracking it and I think it's incredibly unfortunate. And I think unfortunately I think some people will be cynically using this issue in the 2012 election as sort of a wedge issue. We've already seen it. As you mentioned, certain states that are, you know - I mean Sharia law is not coming to the United States and is not a problem for the United States. And it's just - it's sort of a nonsensical. And the guy you mentioned in Norway, of course, was reading some of these U.S. hysterical anti-Islam folks like Robert Spencer and others and he was clearly influenced by them. ",0
51720," And I used to walk through the halls of, like, the Holiday Inn and a few little hotels around there, and I'd get the food, you know, that people had set outside their doors, you know, because there's a lot of good food that people throw out. You know, there's nothing wrong with picking up a french fry. Even if it's a little cold and soggy, they ain't touched that.__EOS__ Did you have to recalibrate, adjust your dream to say, look, this is what I thought I wanted, but I'm going to have to try to go about this a different way?__EOS__ No, I was lucky. I got hooked up with good people, early on. People saw how serious I was. And I had so many brothers, and my dad. I knew how to deal with men. I've often said that I look like a woman, but I think like a man, or I certainly can think like a man. And I was not intimidated by that, and I was never insulted when a, you know, when a guy would, you know, come on to me.__EOS__ How did I even do all that? I don't even remember it because when you love something, you just do what you're doing, or you do what you've got to do to make it work. And I had to work to keep a bus and a band and all that before I got - you know, even before I got with Porter. And then after I got with Porter, I had to make ends meet for myself.",0
51721," No, he was not famous. He was a very wealthy businessman, and I met him and his wife at a function where - I was a student at UCLA, and our professor asked us, in the music department, asked us to come down and do our little scenes for this party, and he would grade us while we were performing in front of this black tie affair in San Diego. __EOS__ We really enjoyed you, and what do you want to do with your life and so forth? And I told him I wanted to go to New York. And he said  Well, why aren't you there now? __EOS__ Well, I'll lend you the money. And I really thought he'd had a little too much champagne, you know. __EOS__ And his wife said  No, no, he means it. He means it. So evidently, he had helped other people out. I think he helped somebody start a restaurant, and another person wanted to have a gas station or something like that. And what he saw was if they had the fire in the belly and the desire and, you know, whatever, to do this, he would give them a leg up by lending them money to get them started. ",0
51722," Well, the good parts. __EOS__ Yes, yes... __EOS__ ...the juicy parts, yes. But, actually, I was telling it as it is because we want to understand why when this marriage gets - goes wrong, what Eleanor has lost. __EOS__ And it is a great deal. ",0

I quit drinking. I lost a lot of friends. Of course, they weren't really friends in the first place, you know?  __EOS__ Yeah. It sounds like you - it's interesting. I wonder if you would agree with this. Ta-Nehisi Coates writes in his book that his father regarded the lives of people around 12 to 18, this was the age when the abyss where unguided black boys were swallowed whole only to find themselves later on street corners and prison tiers.

51727," You are listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News, and we're talking about stillbirth. We're talking about the loss of a child very close to delivery. And our guests are Washington Post reporter Alan Goldenbach, who recently wrote about losing a child to stillbirth, and Sherokee Ilse. She's the author of ""Empty Arms  Coping With Miscarriage, Stillbirth and Infant Death."" __EOS__ I've always said the first domino to fall is getting the word out, is making awareness because the awareness triggers the research. When you have people saying this is a public-health crisis, this is a public-health issue that merits serious attention, that's when resources are driven towards research. And that's what I felt. I was stunned in the months right afterwards, when my wife and I were just - still just shell-shocked and numbed by the facts of what happened. We started doing research, and the first thing we came upon is what - how little this was discussed. __EOS__ Sherokee, talk to me about your experience. __EOS__ Thank you for asking, Michel. I had had a miscarriage, my husband David and I, and then a year and a half later perfect pregnancy - like Alan and his wife - all the way to, well, in our case one day later than him, due date. And the baby had slowed down. I thought that was normal, and that is not normal. They should not be slowing down. And went into be checked and they too told us that devastating news that the baby had died. We saw him briefly. No one else in our family did. We did not understand the importance of making him real to other people, and we named him Brennan. We didn't take any pictures. We didn't get any mementos and so I made it my mission, when I wrote ""Empty Arms,"" to get that book in every hospital to say to families, like Alan, you're devastated. You don't know what you need to do, but let me tell you what I regret that we didn't do, and encourage them to understand why they need to do these sorts of things. ",3
51728," Yeah. Truthfully, you know, a weak rapper can hide behind a lot of production. And that's why, in the film, we didn't have them rap with music.

51729," Why do you think we are so fascinated with that period of history? I mean, when I think of the popularity of a show like ""Mad Men,"" just it seems like we're having a moment where we're all, pop culture-wise, looking back on that fondly. I mean, in some ways it's ironic but in a lot of ways it seems fond.__EOS__ There's a degree of nostalgia involved. ""Mad Men"" is not one of my favorite shows because I think that it takes a view of the '50s and '60s that's strictly upper-middle-class, and I wanted to deal with people that were, you know, not in that citified culture. And people look back and see a lot of bad habits sort of ratified - everything from cigarettes and alcohol to the de facto and real segregation that went on at that time. And people look back on that, I think, sometimes and they see a simpler, happier time. And I think this is something that goes on constantly. We redefine the moment of golden nostalgia in our past, so that in the '50s and '60s what people look back on with that same kind of wouldn't-it-be-nice nostalgia. They look back on the Roaring '20s, you know, the flappers and hip flasks and Pierce Arrow automobiles and all that. So, now for my generation, the '60s have become our roaring '20s.__EOS__ This is such a big book, and you spend a lot of time in the late 1950s in writing it. And are you going to miss that period now that it's over?__EOS__ I am. One of the things that happens, when you sit down from the perspective of 2011 to write about the '50s and '60s, my feeling is one of total inadequacy. I'll never remember what it was like, I'll never be able to put the pieces together. And research will take you a certain way but it won't cut it when it comes to the actual feelings and textures of those times. But the more I worked, the more time that I spent in the past, the more things that I remembered. That was a pleasure. It was a nice, almost like vacation in the way things used to be. But I love the present too, so.... It was great. It was a great vacation. What is it they say? It was a great place but I wouldn't want to live there.",0
51730," And you don't think that European Muslim leaders know that already? __EOS__ I think they know that, and I think some of them have really spoken against this, but I would like to see more of Muslims reaching out to their fellow Muslims around the globe, and to tell them how to respond to this issue, because __EOS__ It sounds like that you think the Americans have something particular to offer the Europeans because of their experience in the U.S. __EOS__ Yes, I do believe that. I do believe that Muslims in America they are in a unique position to share their experience of how they respond to such a thing before the United States. You have religious leaders in America, before, have called the Prophet Muhammad a terrorist. They call him different names. ",3
51731," You're the one that came in here like...__EOS__ I think you get the idea. Now, some people think this is just harmless entertainment, but increasingly, there are other critics who believe that the fighting and the confrontation that they are known for are having some disturbing effects on how young women see themselves and perhaps are seen by others.__EOS__ Thank you.__EOS__ You know, reality TV has been around for a while now, it seems. What do you think started it off?",3
51732," I think government has a major responsibility - and it's not about intervention and control, it's about extending a benefit to all Americans. This health care reform debate is really sort of narrowing down to what a public option is or is it as part of this plan. __EOS__ Well, you've recently said you won't support any bill that does not include a public option. __EOS__ Absolutely. And the reason I said that is because we're then talking about actually layering more federal money on top of an existing system that has the gaps that you noted about uninsured, about prohibitions for preexisting conditions, about no real opportunity for that huge middle margin of the working folk that are the ones that don't make enough to qualify for the Medicaid, the safety net programs and yet make too much - don't make enough to be able to pay the premium for private insurance. __EOS__ That's where this public option is targeted. And I think that is a huge amount of people in this country that could benefit from that program. ",3
51733," Yeah, you didn't have to go anymore.__EOS__ Since you're not someone who turns to the Bible for explanations about life and death and other mysteries, do you find that fiction is helpful in, if not comprehending the world, at least finding people who help explain living in the face of mystery?__EOS__ Oh, yeah. I mean, I would probably have to say that reading fiction - those stories fill the space that, you know, other people might use religious stories for. You know, the bulk of what I know about human life, I've gotten from novels.__EOS__ So your new novel, ""The Leftovers,"" is being adapted into an HBO series. Are you working on the adaptation?",0
51734," Oh, no. __EOS__ Absolutely, and I wasn't embarrassed, but you should have seen my then-fiance and the guy in the dugout just laughing. They were rolling off the seats. And of course, they turned it back down and everybody wondered what the reverberation was all the way through the place. And I don't know… __EOS__ Maybe the song needs the kind of warning you see on car commercials  professional driver closed course. Do not try this at home. __EOS__ Ah. Dan in Salt Lake City, go ahead. ",3
51735," Well, in that particular case you refer to, you're talking about a personality whose words can be quickly and easily grasped onto. This material has its strength in that it is not an analysis. It is not written at the higher levels so it can be publicly massaged. It is, in fact, the raw facts of the war, the same facts that have been passed up the Pentagon chain of command the generals and policymakers are trying to make their decisions on. __EOS__ soldiers and the Afghanis. __EOS__ But some people would dispute your use of the word facts, or indeed that there might be something oxymoronic in raw facts. These, your critics here say, are raw material which hasn't been confirmed. They haven't been established in the way that, say, a journalist would consider something to be a fact. __EOS__ Well, that is a journalist's job, of course, is to take the material and turn it into some story and put their reputation behind it. ",3
51736," Well, they are greatly expanding what's known as the Safe Passage Program. I mean, we're getting an additional 600 workers. I think that roughly doubles the number we have now. And currently, this program has been run around our high schools, and what's changing is, you know, most of the 50 schools that were closed were grammar schools. So those - these Safe Passage workers will now be stationed around grammar schools and will be providing a different sort of support. But you're right. The city is also - the mayor and the school system have made a very - have really emphasized the fact that the closing of these schools, and the transfer of these students to new - what the district's calling welcoming schools - is really a citywide, communitywide effort.__EOS__ Intensive and expensive, Linda.__EOS__ Intensive and expensive, right. And it would be difficult to capture the full cost of this. But just the Safe Passage Program alone - the, you know, so those additional adult community workers with the green vests on - you know, just that program alone, we're doubling. The cost for that is now going to 16 million, roughly - just shy of 16 million for that aspect of it. So it is expensive.__EOS__ Well, we have about a minute left and I have to ask you are parents satisfied? Do they feel as though - I mean, school starts in a couple weeks - parents, do they feel safe?",3
51737," …you've struggled with… __EOS__ …neither has Senator Clinton. Well, I struggle with issues every day. You know, every time I have to make a decision about how I view our exit strategy out of Iraq. Every time that I have to make a decision about how do I talk about our healthcare crisis in this country and, you know, how we solve it. __EOS__ Your informal adviser, Samantha Power, who was dismissed for a much publicized remark, also said something else in recent days about your plan for getting out of Iraq. She said that your discussion of spending 16 months or so to get troops out was only a best-case scenario, and that you would not follow some plan that you developed as a presidential candidate. Is that accurate? __EOS__ You know, I don't think that is necessarily an accurate quote of hers. But let me tell you very clearly what I've said, which is that I will begin withdrawing immediately. I will do so in consultation with the joint chiefs of staff and the commanders on the field. My best understanding at this point is that we can safely remove our combat troops out at the pace of one to two brigades per month. ",3
51738," I see.__EOS__ Yes. I asked for that from my chaplain at school. I was always in trouble with the authorities because my attention span was completely off because all I heard was music, so when I looked at the teachers, their mouths were just moving and I was singing all the - Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell and, you know, all the new bebop players that just emerged and we were mesmerized by them. And so, like, that's what I was hearing and whenever my name was called, I ended up at the principal's office because I didn't know the question. And so...__EOS__ But also, you just had trouble - you just had trouble with authority, period. I mean - right? That's fair to say? You just...__EOS__ Not really. Not really. I was a good boy, you know. My mother thought, oh, what a good boy.",2

51740," Well, we have to talk about ""No Country For Old Men,"" the Coen brothers' film, where you play Anton Chigurh, this truly scary, sociopathic killer. First of all, just explain how you got the look of this guy. __EOS__ Well, Tommy Lee Jones brought a book, a photo book, of photos that were taken from the frontier - old Mexico. And there was this guy who was in the photo, it was kind of a black and white photo with a prostitute in a brothel in the frontier. __EOS__ We want this. And the photo actually was very blurry, and I said  I don't know what you mean. They said  You'll know. You'll know soon. __EOS__ So they put me in the makeup and hair trailer, and the hairdresser, which is a great, great man, he did this horrible haircut on my hair, with my hair. ",1
51741," Thanks for having me.__EOS__ I'd like to start by talking about the actual crafting of this book because the form is unusual. It's a really short book - 46 small chapters - and rather than a narrative, the book is made up of short fragments, anecdotes, little bits of poetry. Why did you write it this way?__EOS__ Well, the book came from the ashes of another book, which was much more linear in construction. But at a certain point, I realized I wanted to capture more of the fragmentary nature of thought, and especially of the way emotion moves in and out of people. And I began to write on notecards and shuffle them together; and I started to find these startling juxtapositions, which I thought were interesting, and led me down this path.__EOS__ You also have an eye for capturing specific detail, and sometimes it's quite funny...",0
51742," Yes, but it was also a way for individuals to actually not be alone, a way to really survive some, you know, horrible situations and some uncomfortable situations. You know, by bringing your voice and bringing your voice inside yourself and with others, it created a power and a way to exist in the world. __EOS__ Bernice Johnson Reagon, you must be awfully proud of your daughter. __EOS__ She's fierce. She's one of the fiercest people I know on the planet. __EOS__ I wonder. Was there a moment, when you were 15 or so, when you said, mom, this music, it's getting a little old, don't you think? ",2
51743," What would you tell Hilary Swank about getting into this character, what she should avoid doing, what you wanted her to bring out? __EOS__ Well, Hilary is a consummate actor who is deeply immersed in the research of Amelia or any character she plays. For close to six week, I think, we both went through a process of getting the look right, getting the hair, getting the clothing, of course, getting the freckles, you know, the different looks through the years. __EOS__ Hey, Hil, a little less Amelia, please. __EOS__ Less Amelia… ",1
51744," Joe, Bruce and Sam, all runaways slowly getting used to life outside The Crick. It's not an easy transition, as Joe explains. __EOS__ And once you leave, then you automatically just start thinking, you know, nothing even matters. My family is out there, I'm out here and I'm going to hell, so what the  am I supposed to do? You know, you're not taught to think about this life. You're taught to think about the next life. __EOS__ ""Sons of Perdition"" is part of the Silverdocs Documentary film festival of the American Film Institute Silver Theatre, just outside of Washington. __EOS__ 800-989-8255.

51745," But when E.B. White recorded his own narration of this book in 1970, he said this...__EOS__ This is a story of the barn. I wrote it for children and to amuse myself.__EOS__ Story of the barn. And Homer Zuckerman's big old barn is where everything unfolds. It's where Wilbur the pig finds a home, where he meets Charlotte the spider.__EOS__ It smelled of hay and it smelled of manure. It smelled of the perspiration of tired and the wonderful sweet breath of patient cows. It often had a sort of peaceful smell, as though nothing bad could happen ever again in the world.",0
51746," Right.__EOS__ ...Provides that armor. Well, Eliana, what about you? Does that provide any special...__EOS__ You know...__EOS__ ...Armor or any special boost to your kids to say, you know, I am special...",3
51747," How many people do you imagine, do you calculate have been displaced? __EOS__ Oh, 1,000. We've evacuated 35,000 people in just Cedar Rapids alone and we have evacuations going on - mandatory or voluntary - in roughly ten different places as we speak. You know, this is not a hundred-year event, it's a 500-year event. It's something that is absolutely beyond anyone's wildest imagination in terms of destruction and devastation. __EOS__ How is the drinking water in some of the flooded places? __EOS__ Oh, we've got - it's not good - we've got cities that have no drinking water.

51748," a visit with a man who brings the flavors of the Ivory Coast to suburban Virginia. Could he be the next Iron Chef? __EOS__ Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate being here. __EOS__ What made you join the service to begin with? __EOS__ Well, believe or not, I was a radio broadcaster in Norfolk, Virginia, at WNSB if you don't mind me saying. It's a public radio station. I graduated in mass communications, and I was working, doing due diligence at $3.35 in an hour. Eventually, I went on to do some TV work, just behind the scenes, but again, no money in it. And I had a guy come in to do a commercial from the Army, and I was like, wow, this looks pretty exciting. Lots of ribbons on his uniform. He must make a lot of money. We struck up a conversation, and next thing you know, I was at Fort Jackson, South Carolina in basic training. ",0
51749," I really don't. It kind of goes back and forth. __EOS__ Or are they all your favorites? __EOS__ They're definitely... __EOS__ Excuse me, you're new to this business. I've interviewed a lot of musicians. ",2
51750," Yeah. It is a countercultural pitch. It really is. I mean, in an age where people embrace - you know, people that are fast and jump high and people that throw the ball hard, I mean, you're talking about trying to do the opposite. You're trying to talk about, you know, doing something that's erratic and slow. And how can you get big league hitters out with that particular pitch?__EOS__ And in a game that celebrates, in many ways, youth, this is a pitch that most people don't really master until their mid-30s, ancient by baseball standards.__EOS__ Yeah. And I would be careful to use the word master. It's such a - I don't know if you ever master the pitch. Charlie Hough told me the first day I ever met him when I was learning the pitch, he said, it took me one day to learn how to throw a knuckleball, and took me a lifetime to learn how to threw it for strikes.__EOS__ Yeah. Throw it over the plate.",1
51751," Hi, Sean.__EOS__ Hi. You know, I'm not an activist, but my comment really is, it really surprises me in today's day and age how people are still narrow-minded. And my father actually died of AIDS when I was in college, and you know, even today, when I talk to people, and I've heard people even make jokes, like that person's going to get AIDS or something like that, and I'll bring up my father died, you know, they kind of give me weird looks, or they feel uncomfortable how they should even talk to me. Or, you know, sometimes I feel like they wonder if, you know, well, your dad had AIDS, do you have AIDS? And it just - you know, and it makes me feel sometimes that - I still talk about it, but you know, I feel a little closed off even talking about it to people.__EOS__ That, Sean, is called stigma, and that's our biggest opponent in this battle against AIDS. We've come so far with the advancement of medical treatment, but we haven't really come much further than 31 years ago when AIDS first started with the stigma involved.__EOS__ I agree, thank you.",0
51752,"  So now I'm in a band with Johanna Fateman and J.D. Samson.      It's called Le Tigre.  And it's really different from being in a punk      band. __EOS__   I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got, I've got,      I've got... __EOS__  We have, like, computers and keyboards, and there's this      really great freedom of standing there, and I could play guitar into the      computer for three hours and then we sit there and edit it together. __EOS__   .... ",2
51753," I really felt that way because just personally, I feel the comedies I'd watch - I don't see a ton of comedies, I'll have to admit, in the theaters. But the ones I see I always feel like even though I like them, I feel like women get relegated to kind of crappy roles a lot of times. I get really bummed out when it's - oh, they're the girlfriend who's a drag, or it's the, you know, the - any movie. Like, you know, like a big action movie, like, the guy is off trying to save the world. The woman is like  You are not spending enough time with the family. It's like  Oh, she'd rather him be at home than save the world, boo her. __EOS__ It actually was a different experience for me in that I really do come from a place where funny is funny, and I don't think about my lady parts very often when making comedy. __EOS__ All right, how do we make this as funny as possible? I didn't see them setting out to change anything. But that's probably for the better. __EOS__ It's been great to have you. Maya Rudolph plays Lillian in the film ""Bridesmaids,"" and Paul Feig is the director. Best wishes to both of you. ",1
51754," ...like the appearing visually. Yeah.__EOS__ I don't know if you mind me telling this story or not, but I feel like Ira, in some ways, is the least phased or the least changed by his own celebrity of anyone who I've ever encountered. Like, one time we were in a Starbucks and - getting coffee. And this guy just came up to Ira and was, like, hey, you're Ira Glass. And Ira's, like, yeah. And he just started, like, the guy just started pitching Ira a story for the radio show.__EOS__ He started telling this long, elaborate story. And I was like, yeah, Ira, we gotta go. You know, I was just trying to bail him out like you would your friend at a party who's being hit on. And Ira didn't want to leave. Like, he's listening to this guy's story. And we're leaving. We walk down the street, and I go, Ira, what do you do? You just talk to random people at the Starbucks about their stories? And he was like, yeah, yeah, that's what I do. That's my whole job.__EOS__ Sometimes those stories work out.",1
51755," And where does it end? __EOS__ It ends in the middle of nowhere, I guess, just shy of this butterfly reserve or prob - there was more political to-do about it. But in the end, the story goes that the butterflies' migrating pattern through Southwest Michigan was - I don't know, that piece of land was particularly important to them. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And so… ",0
51756,"  You always had to be quiet when I was growing up. If you made noise, the Shining Path guerrillas would come, take you away and kill you. And in the end, it was the local people who got rid of the violence, who began to arm themselves and make rounds to keep the community safe.__EOS__ In the film ""The Milk of Sorrow,"" Solier plays a young woman affected by the rural violence of the '80s living in modern day Peru. During the time of Peru's armed conflict, some Peruvians believed that campesina women who were raped had passed their fear onto the children through their breast milk. Solier's character is one of those children grown up.__EOS__ The movie catapulted her into a successful international career. Throughout the film, she also sings, and she's since become a professional singer, too.__EOS__  When I got to Lima, the music I'd sung growing up was looked down upon. It was something that people thought was only good for getting drunk and getting into fights. I said to myself, people in the capital and foreigners, they don't know what the music is really like where I'm from. I wanted to do something different.",1
51757," Great to be here, Scott.__EOS__ Let's give people a good sampling of what's in here. The shark from ""Jaws"" apparently kept a diary. Could I ask you to read his June 23 entry to us?__EOS__ Absolutely.  June 23. Guilt does funny things to a shark. When I feel guilty about something, like, oh, eating a woman, I start to hate myself. When I start to hate myself, I engage in self-destructive behavior. If I were a human like the one I ate, that might mean eating a bunch of ice cream or getting drunk, but I'm a shark. And I dragged a boy from shore and ate him up. He was smaller than my previous meal, but I don't know. It still doesn't feel like progress to me. It's like the only way I can feel good is to do bad.__EOS__ That is truly a troubled, cold-blooded soul, isn't it?",0
51758," Hi. How are you guys?__EOS__ Hi there.__EOS__ Good.__EOS__ I had a question for the author. When I was a kid, I really enjoyed mystery novels like ""The Hardy Boys"" and ""Encyclopedia Brown,"" and I was really - I felt really connected to those main characters because they were young adults, like me, solving mysteries.",0
51759," You want me to sing it?__EOS__ A little bit. Fear not.__EOS__  Abra abra cadabra. I want to reach out and grab you.__EOS__ All right. Allan, thank you. Thank you for going first. We really appreciate it.",2
51760," Yeah. __EOS__ And that's, you know, revolutions get a real fervor, and this attitude gets a real velocity and people start to act, in some cases, like a mob cheerleading for the war. And the mob, sometimes, is not interested in facts. We've seen it again and again. You know, the Misrata was struck with  rockets at the fuel depot earlier in the spring. And we went there, we talked to the firefighters, we saw the burning tanks, we saw the dud rockets all around, we saw  rockets and their remnants. It was a regular old  barrage had been aimed at this fuel depot. And yet people online wanted to turn this into no, this was a Gadhafi airstrike. Therefore, NATO is failing, we need more NATO support. And to this day still find people trafficking in false accounts of real events that I can give you dozens of examples and it's, you know, when revolution takes hold in the motion sort of group think starts to inform and a lot of times, you know, the facts get cast aside. __EOS__ You said some things that are critical about the rebels in terms of their leadership, in terms of propaganda. Compare that to the other side, to Gadhafi's forces. __EOS__ I think it's important to keep this in mind as a matter of scale. There have been a lot of things that we've been told by the opposition side that turned out later not to be true. There have been more things, in my experience, by the Gadhafi side. And the volume and the scale of some of the things that they have said and some of the things they have done are of a different order. That doesn't excuse. I mean one of the risks of the revolution is that because you think your right as a revolutionary, you think you have a license to do things that you wouldn't ordinarily do, to deceive, to kill, to lie. ",3
51761," But you also support people's right to demonstrate. __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ Free speech… __EOS__ Provided strictly non-violent. So freedom of speech, it's very important. Now for example, among Tibetan and among our friend, some are very, very critical towards me. ",3
51762," We're speaking with Jay Shears and Babydaddy of Scissor Sisters. What can you tell us about this song? __EOS__ That song was one of the last songs that we wrote for this album, and it took us a while to get this record started. We'd been writing for a long time. We were working on a record for about 18 months that we essentially scrapped, and that was a really hard decision to make. And... __EOS__ Now, is this - does this story in any way relate to Elton John? 'Cause I've heard a story. __EOS__ It does in a way. I mean, he's one of our best friends and he's almost like a member of the band himself. He's very spiritually invested in what we do. And there came a point where Babydaddy went down to Atlanta to visit and took some semblance of a record with him. ",2
51763," That was in October 1977, and I was involved with the military arm of the organization and had been for about six years. I concocted a plot to kill a witness. The witness was testifying against Huey Newton, who had just recently returned from Cuba, where he had been in exile for about three years. __EOS__ And then what happened? __EOS__ Well, I was a fugitive for three years. I turned myself in and I was convicted of felony murder. And I went to prison in California, and I served four years, eight months and nine days in the California Department of Corrections. __EOS__ Who were you as a man when you walked into prison and did it change by the time you walked out? ",0
51764," The Construction of Latino/a Identity Among Latino/a Muslims in the United States. __EOS__ Good to be here. __EOS__ Thank you for having me. __EOS__ Michael, first, can you explain how these latest accusations came to light? It's part of a lawsuit that's going on, right? ",3
51765," Yes. So what was different for you about being on a Broadway stage compared to, you know, anything you'd ever done before?__EOS__ I mean it's the hardest thing I've ever done. I mean the difference is you're working with people and - A) you're working with somebody else's lines. I mean when I perform I write my standup so I'm doing my lines. You're working with somebody else's lines that wants them done precisely. So when you do a play every night, when you're done, or every time you're done, you come in the next day there's a list of how many lines you got wrong. And...__EOS__ Yeah. So, yeah, everybody else would have a, you know, like one page, two page. Mine's would look like The New York Times Sunday Edition.__EOS__ So there's that pressure. Then you have the pressure to the other actors to always hit your marks, and every - you just have this pressure to everybody, where in standup everybody just has to move where I move and, you know, whatever I do, if I want to tell the jokes on stage, it's fine. If I want to walk off stage and jump in the fifth row, it's fine. But here I'm in the play. I am - and when I do standup, I am the play.",1
51766," Well, for example, when ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" happened, you know, I was - you know, you try to be a nice boss, and then that doesn't really work very well most of the time, you know, because you get taken advantaged of. __EOS__ So you actually cast in your movie ""Extract"" my good friend Gene Simmons, and I say that because a lot of listeners to the show know that we had a kind of rough interview together. __EOS__ Yeah, I actually looked that up because I had heard about that. __EOS__ Did you? You'd heard about that? So you cast him as this kind of sleazy lawyer who has, you know, all those slip-and-fall, sue-now, tacky TV ads and billboards. So how did you think of Gene Simmons to play somebody sleazy? ",1
51767," What were you trying to show through that process, that experience that people who are nervous about approaching books, right? Because you don't want to look foolish.__EOS__ I feel many things about this, which is that sometimes readers, when they're young, are given, say, a book like ""Moby Dick"" to read. And it is, you know, interesting, complicated book, but it's not something that somebody who has never read a book before should be given as an example of, you know, why you will really love to read, necessarily. And so I think Lambiase probably had that kind of experience with reading books. I like to believe, as a writer, that anybody who isn't a reader yet has just not found the right book. So I hoped that that was what Lambiase's reading journey would show.__EOS__ One thing about A.J. Fikry being on this island is he's more than an outsider to that community. He's also Southeast Asian, and it's mostly white community. The daughter he ends up adopting is biracial. And why did you do that for these particular characters?__EOS__ Well, I myself am mixed race - my mother is Korean, and my father is an American Jew - so I've always felt other. But I think what's a little bit amazing about books, again, is the way in which they can sort of transcend that, to an extent. And I also wanted the world as I see it. And the world as I see it is a world that is increasingly with people of different ethnicities, you know, as an author.",0
51768,"   My name is Paul      Rusesabagina. I am the house manager of the most luxurious hotel in the      capital of Rwanda, a place that my family and I happily called our      home--until the day everything changed. __EOS__  Joshua Levs reports that Rusesabagina described his lost faith      in humanity, and called for help to end African dictatorships. __EOS__  When the      most serious things started, we saw them turning backs, closing ears and      eyes, and running away. __EOS__  He described how difficult it was for him, a Hutu married to a      Tutsi, to save people with no help from the rest of the world, while more      than a million people were killed over a few months.  And as in the      movie, Rusesabagina said he hit a turning point when the militias      insisted he kill his own family. ",3
51769," I don't remember being very relaxed. It was a really fun shoot. It was really, you know, all these amazing young British actors just being very charismatic and fun. And I don't think I spoke very much. I was very, very shy and I kind of hid in the toilets most of the time when we weren't, you know, required on set. But it's just...__EOS__ Really?__EOS__ Yeah. I mean I was - yeah. The A.D.'s would come and find me in the toilets.__EOS__ You were just hiding?",3
51770," That's true. He did say that. But what he was trying to do is to tell the associates in the company a sense of urgency. And that is that operationally, we weren't making money. And so we need to make sure that the company's expenditures and overhead are in line with the business that we're doing today, not the business that someday we would want to do in the future. __EOS__ Back to Chrysler being a major American car company that's privately owned - could you give us an example of what it means on a day-to-day basis to be freed from the pressures of Wall Street? __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ You're not necessarily freed from the pressures of public opinion, though. ",3
51771," I think what you have to do is look at the record of what he is doing. And the testimony in the Senate is so compelling. I attended the hearings. Most of all, listen to the families of the coal miners that died. They are the people that are on the scene, that listen to the hearings, that know this person and know the changes that we've made in the mine safety and virtually unanimous. Of all the families that attended these hearings and lost loved ones in the Sago mines and the other mines, say this man is just not the person to do it. They are looking for the future for the protecting of these miners. __EOS__ Senator, may I turn to another question. President Bush is in Iraq on a previously unannounced visit, but he is there. He's been conducting this review, notedly, over the last day. What are Democrats saying about Iraq these days? __EOS__ What we need coming out of this is something more than window dressing or clichés. We need, I would hope, a recognition that we have had troops in Iraq now longer than we fought the Korean War. And at the end of this year, we will have had the American military fighting in Iraq longer than World War II. __EOS__ Well, it is a political problem for the President. Clearly his numbers are down on Iraq. But there he is in Baghdad. Maybe this is going to help him politically. ",3
51772," This was a very collaborative process, and we had a number of filmmakers shooting in the square. The entire team met in the square in 2011, and we all shot various parts of the film. We ended up with about 1,600 hours and, out of that, made a hour and a half film.__EOS__ You have to explain that you actually took this film to the Sundance festival earlier this year. And I gather they told you, go back and keep filming.__EOS__ People thought we were crazy, actually, because we did show it at the Sundance Film Festival. But as we were on the way to Sundance, our characters, all of them, were back in the streets fighting because President Morsi had pushed a constitution through and was claiming dictatorial powers. So it became a much more interesting story because it showed that the people that we followed and the people of Egypt were not going to rest, and they were going to fight against fascism, whether the face of fascism was Mubarak or the army or the Muslim Brotherhood.__EOS__ Do you feel that you have made a comprehensive documentary here, even if it is through the eyes of these young people? Or did you ultimately have to make editorial decisions? I can imagine at one point in the documentary, I could hear a Muslim Brotherhood parliamentarian, whom I know, I could just imagine him saying they left out the part where the holdover judges throw out everything that the Muslim Brotherhood does. They left out the old judiciary that is still there, which you did. A significant omission or you just have to tell the story?",1
51773," What always made me laugh when my wife was pregnant was there were always some guys who would say don't look when the baby comes out. Don't look because you'll never want to have sex again. And you know, I certainly looked and it didn't trouble me at all. But the type of person that can't handle it I think is really funny. And there were those people who, you know, their wives had babies and they had never read the baby books and they stayed in denial about it for most of the time. But I wanted to do the thing that you never see in a movie. __EOS__ ...get a work permit unless you have been born. So I had a Catch-22 there. But that is, you know, one of my favorite scenes, and Jay Baruchel is hilarious flipping out. __EOS__ I'm interested in your approach to casting, because you have this whole like stable of people, like a whole repertory cast you've develop from -basically from ""Freaks and Geeks."" There's like Seth Rogen and Jason Segel and... __EOS__ James Franco. ",1
51774," Well, I mean, he's - as a singer, he's such a, like, a romantic, and you're so not in your art. I can't speak about your private life. So what is the attraction to him? __EOS__ Well, because Johnny Mathis is the opposite of me. First of all, he's - he doesn't do any publicity, ever. Have you ever seen a picture of Johnny Mathis at a world premiere? At a party? He does no promotion whenever he has a big tour, which he does constantly still. I went to them. They're sold out, with no advance publicity. __EOS__ I have a one-man show. But so does Johnny Mathis, have a Christmas show. And so do I, but I try to imagine our very, very different audiences because Johnny Mathis, to me, is to me the type of mainstream that I will never, ever be able to have. And everyone wants to have hits like that. But at the same time, Johnny Mathis said to me  I always wanted to be a jazz singer. So, in a way, your opposite sometimes isn't exactly what you believed him to be, too. __EOS__ So he was lovely, though, when I went to his house and everything. ",0
51775," I don't want to keep harping on this, but I'll tell you how you don't change perceptions by the media or by scholars or by politicians. The only way that you can change your perceptions is not by gathering data. Data doesn't change people's minds. Relationships change people's minds. And the only way that some guy living in Wisconsin is going to have a relationship with some guy living in Tehran is by reading his stories, by learning who he is.__EOS__ And, Firoozeh Dumas, as you tell your stories, do you think you're making an effect? Do you think you're changing things?__EOS__ Oh, I do. Actually, I'm lucky enough to be on the lecture circuit, and so I get to travel throughout the United States. And I generally get invited to places where there are not a lot of Iranians. I'm like the Iranian to go.__EOS__ And the - you know, when I give a lecture and then there's always a Q&A, and I feel like I could stay for seven hours, and the questions continue. And there's always this element of surprise. People - I can't tell you how much - how many times people has said to me you're not at all what I expected when they said there was an Iranian woman coming. And I - it's like being an overweight gymnast. There is that element of surprise.",0
51776," The Tea Party's Cold War Roots."" He asks why current Republican Party leaders have done virtually nothing to challenge extremist ideas in their party and a great deal to abet them. __EOS__ Hi, I want to tell you a little bit about Beck University. This is something that I've been working on for a while. I don't know when we started devaluing people who are self-educated. __EOS__ That's Glenn Beck from his Beck University website. Sean Wilentz, welcome to FRESH AIR. __EOS__ It's great to be here. ",3
51777," And there's nothing original about that idea. You know, there is no book in human history that has been revisited more times than the Haggadah. There are about 7,000 editions that we know of and probably many multiples of that that have been created.__EOS__ So, what was lacking? What in the conversations, what in the debate did you feel was missing?__EOS__ I did not come from a traditionally observant household. Nobody in my family speaks Hebrew. We relied very heavily on the Haggadah as a user's guide into this holiday, not only to take us through the requisite prayers and songs and stages of the Seder but also to encourage the kinds of questions we might ask. So, when we would speak about the Haggadahs that we used - and we went through many different versions in the course of the Seders in my life - when we would say that the writing was good in one, what we meant was it was good relative to other Haggadahs, as opposed to good as compared to our favorite novels of the year, or our favorite, you know, political writing. And I thought  why are we using this kind of diminished standard instead of our very highest standard? And I should say also that in my family about half the people at the Seder table were writers. So, why would we accept, you know, a translation that was unintentionally ambiguous or that was not a clear or faithful translation of the Hebrew.__EOS__ And speaking of the translation itself, Nathan, this is where you come in. How did Jonathan convince you that this was a project that you should take on - translating Hebrew and Aramaic into English for this new version of the Haggadah?",0
51778," We'll just to clarify. In many occasions, those allegations were that those attorneys were let go because they were insufficiently vigorous to pursue Democrats or maybe too vigorous in pursuing Republicans. __EOS__ Yeah, and I guess I have - I'm more skeptical about the part about too vigorous in pursuing Republicans, but, well, I have been, maybe these days, I'm not skeptical about anything. Yeah. Exactly. And I think it's clear that that happened. I think that there were criticisms about David Iglesias not bringing indictments before an election to help the Republicans in that election. I think there was criticism against John McKay for not indicting someone after a close governor's race in the state of Washington. __EOS__ And then said it was because of performance reasons. __EOS__ And - yeah, well, that would be the second, in my view, horrible thing that happened. Once they got caught, doing what they shouldn't have been doing, making these decisions for improper reasons, they were willing to throw these people, my colleagues, under the bus and said they had performance reasons, when it was really the farthest thing from the truth. And I think that was when they really nailed the coffin shut. If they did stopped when they -this first came to light and said, hey, we didn't intend for this process to work this way. We have allowed improper political considerations. This is not our brightest shining moment, we're going to fix it, this won't happen again. I think this story would have been over in February. ",3

I'm not trying to re-teach math per se. It's not tutorial. I'm trying to give people a better feeling about what math is, why mathematicians do it, why we  and also people who love math, why we love it. __EOS__ I mean, in other words, she still doesn't like it, but they made her want to like math. __EOS__ But one of the problems, and tell me how you struggled with this in the book and to some degree in the column  Okay, so we all know integers, and we know the signs of multiplication and division, but pretty quickly, you get to sigma and epsilon and delta and, you know, integral functions, and they just look like  well, they look like Greek for want of a better term...

You cry and moan and say it will work out, but honey child, I've got my doubts. You can't see the forest for the trees. Oh, don't get me wrong. It's not that I knock it.

So I don't have any problem there. The administration's going to do a decent job in their attempts to verify that. __EOS__ What about the North Korean record for proliferation? We know the story of the allegations, at least, that the building that the Israelis struck in a raid in Syria was a North-Korean-built reactor of some sort. Are they expected to, or are they obliged to disclose exactly whom they've shared technology with? __EOS__ Well this is a very interesting point and, for me, the most serious concerns that we should have with regard to U.S. security and North Korea's nuclear weapons program. What we don't have is a discussion of what they did, who they did it with, what the extent is, and whether there are other countries involved. So that is a problem yet to be solved. ",3

I'm David Bianculli in for Terry Gross, back with more of Terry's 2010 conversation with author David Rakoff. He's best known for his humorous magazine essays and his stories on ""This American Life."" his new collection of essays, now out in paperback, is called ""Half Empty."" The book, which recently won the 2011 Thurber Prize for American Humor, begins with an essay on the power of negative thinking. It ends with a story of his recurrence of cancer for which he's currently being treated with long-term chemotherapy. __EOS__ You have a very funny section in your book about, about your childhood. And... __EOS__ Yes. ",3
51787," Interesting choice. __EOS__ I mentioned that we'd be hearing ""Did I Let You Know"" and you said, interesting choice. __EOS__ Tell us about the album title, ""I'm With You."" __EOS__ We went through a process of trying to determine what the real title of our record would be and we were a little befuddled because usually we look at a song title, or a song lyric, or some kind of a slogan that happens during the process of making a record. And none of those things were revealing themselves to us. And so, finally, one day, towards the very end of the process, we were sharing ideas for record titles, and Josh had written down on a piece of paper, I'm With You. We all kind of looked around at each other and said, you know what? That feels perfect. We'll take it. ",2
51788," Well, I think it's absolutely true. You know, up to this point, I think it's true, that is we, you know - the Clinton health care plan was devised within the White House. It never passed any committees of the - full committees of the Congress and it was a long, you know, a very long process. That's not what we are. Democrats are much more united in general, but also on health care, reform is moving. It's moving, you know, faster. It's better than the President is not mired in those, you know, specifics. But, we're also at, I think, at a different moment now. I think we've crossed the point where the public has said okay, we now want to see the details. __EOS__ Given your hard won experience in the Clinton years on health care, what do you think the lessons are that the Obama administration should be mindful of here? __EOS__ You have to respect people. You have to respect that they are making rational judgments when they are cautious about reform. They want reform, but their reasons for being cautious are real. And therefore, you need to respect them and give them information that they need to make about how this will, you know, impact them. And that means becoming both a teacher at a big level on why the country has to make the change, but also a teacher at a micro level on, you know, how health exchanges will, you know, bring lower, you know, costs - how that competition will bring lower costs. __EOS__ Stan Greenberg, thanks for coming in.

51790," And David, we hear the president's one-time rival, Senator John McCain, saying this plan seems reasonable to him. __EOS__ Yeah. There's mostly a consensus. And it's interesting. When you talk to foreign policy experts and defense people, Iraq is now the bright spot in the Middle East, and Pakistan and Afghanistan are the dark spot. And -if I could be a little partisan here - we all dump over George Bush and much of it is earned, but the decision to do the surge was one of the best presidential decisions of my lifetime, and it allowed Barack Obama to do what he's doing today. __EOS__ Let's talk about the budget that was unveiled yesterday. It will create a one-and-three-quarter-trillion dollar deficit. And David, you write today in the New York Times this shows that the rot ingrained in government is not expunged. There's something rotten in the state of Washington. __EOS__ I'm having my emotional crisis over here. It's like the moment in the marriage when the wife turns to the husband and says, I don't know who you are. Because I thought, I thought Barack Obama was a nice, centrist guy who would bring us Head Start and health-care reform and basically be moderate. But this is quite a progressive, quite a liberal budget, which has spending on all sorts of fronts. And to me, really doesn't pay for it - relies on sort of rosy scenarios of growth to pay for it, promises 95 percent of the American people they won't have to pay any money ever in the future. ",3
51791," This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Our guest, Mark Derr, is a naturalist and writer who's been thinking about how dogs evolved from their prehistoric ancestors, and how they came to have such a close relationship with humans. Derr believes new genetic and archeological research suggests our friendship with dogs and wolves goes back thousands of years farther than previously believed.__EOS__ Mark Derr, welcome to FRESH AIR. Now, in your book, you tell us that there's new research from genetics, and from the archeological record, that's changed our views - or at least challenged the view that we've traditionally had, about how dogs - or their dog ancestors and humans became acquainted thousands of years ago. What was the traditional view of how dogs and people got together?__EOS__ Well, by traditional view, I use the one that's most current today and appears almost everywhere in print and on television programs. And that is that the dog somehow is a self-domesticated animal who fed on garbage dumps as people began to give up their hunting and gathering ways at the end of the last ice age, and move into semi-permanent villages - that these wolves were scavenging their dumps and the more they scavenged, the tamer they became and ultimately, they became these self-tamed dump-divers, I call them, who people then took into their homes, or began to use in ways that more resembled their wolfish past.__EOS__ So we now believe that - or you believe that wolves became socialized and ran with humans before they began settling down to villages, when they were still hunters and gatherers, right?",3
51792," That's our guest, Michael Caine, with Sean Connery in ""The Man Who Would Be King."" __EOS__ Oh yeah, very well. And we shot all that in Morocco.

51793," I mean, he - he, let's see, he graduated from college in '56. So he was, you know, pretty much in that Eisenhower generation and beforehand. I mean, you know, kind of was in his 30s during the '60s, but he missed the '60s entirely, same with my mother. They kind of were in that kind of Nixon silent majority.__EOS__ So the character at the center of the book, the character that everybody is speculating about, is the writer, A.N. Dyer, who is a reclusive writer who hasn't really written anything new in many years. His novel ""Ampersand"" is not only a very famous novel, it's a novel that was central to many young people when they were growing up, you know, when they were coming of age. What made the novel within the novel, the ""Ampersand"" novel, so famous? What did it mean in the lives of its readers?__EOS__ That's a really good question. I'm so curious. In some ways, I kind of want to try to write ""Ampersand"" next to figure that out. It was - I always saw it as kind of the opposite to ""Catcher in the Rye."" Whereas ""Catcher in the Rye"" was very much about, you know, Holden Caulfield's struggles, ""Ampersand"" is kind of about - it's more of a Dostoevsky version of childhood, of adolescence, where it's a lot tougher, and it's more Machiavellian, and more rough and nasty things happen.__EOS__ So people have this idea in their mind of him still as a kind of young writer, because that's how they remember him, but in reality, he's, like, he's old. He has gout. His big toe is killing him. He can't really write anymore.",0

Sure. __EOS__ That qualifies as barbecuing. __EOS__ We've got, Lisa, with two or three rigs in there in which we're doing oysters. The first one that I love is by the Whitener Brothers in Blacksburg, where they take a sack of oysters and with a galvanized trashcan. They put a cinder block down the bottom of it, put about a gallon of water, put it over a burner, and put the oysters in there, put the lid on it. And the first time we come up on a party with these things going on it's like, you know, they're cooking garbage out there, you know. And you see the steam coming up but it's like a perfect rig. It's inexpensive. And, of course, I use new trashcans. ",0

51797," on Monday, violinist Philippe Quint left his $4 million Stradivarius in minicab in New York City.

His wife was in the hospital expecting twins at the time. That violin was also returned. __EOS__ I think sometimes it is absent-mindedness, sometimes it's hyper-focus. The level of challenge it requires to perform that we expect in professionals is very demanding and somebody organizing one's entire soul to put across a great performance, may miss things out. __EOS__ So, you're saying - now, we understand you're a psychotherapist - that there might be some subconscious ambivalence toward that instrument.

51798,"  Thank you. __EOS__  Bye-bye. __EOS__  Hi, Mr. Morris.  I am wondering what you have discovered      in your research and such on Beethoven--his spirituality and religion in      his life and how that played a role in obviously very spiritual music      that he has composed. __EOS__  Well, he was born Catholic, in the Catholic Rhineland, and      he spent most of his youth playing organ in churches around Bonn, so he      had plenty of schooling in the liturgy and in the music of the Catholic      Church. As an adult, he was not by any means a churchgoer.  He was      pantheistic by nature.  He had vague notions that God is resident in      nature; in fact, more than vague.  He genuinely believed that nature was      instinct with religious and with inspirational values that contributed to      his music.  And all his religious rapture tended to come out in      pantheistic symphonies and other music of that kind. ",0

You've got to do it. You've got to do it. And my dad - it's actually very tough for me to imagine my father in the Black Panther Party. I was born in 1975, and by that point, he had been gone for about three years. And I certainly knew people in my time as a child who spent their time, you know, talking black, we got to do this, we got to do that. And my impression, my father didn't talk. He really did not.  __EOS__ And the way he did it was to start a press, a publishing company, in your basement.  __EOS__ He did. He did. And he told me this story, you know, I'm, again, of a completely different era. And I retell the story in the book. I was interviewing him and I was talking to him about the inspiration for the press that he has now, which the basic business model is to go back and republish the works of African-American authors who worked before a time when people got advances, like I got an advance for this book.

I had a guy jump over the backseat and grab me from behind and try to, you know - but I just jerked the cab forward and he kind of bounced back, and I bounced him around a little bit. And that was a lot easier to do before antilock brakes came in. You can't stop the cabs as quick as you used to. __EOS__ You used to be able to just - boom, you know. And they'd go  and then you hit the gas. And you can't really do that anymore unless your antilocks are broken. __EOS__ So you'd use the cab, in effect, as a weapon to kind of throw him around the cab? __EOS__ Right.

So C-3PO would be freaking out about something - like the Woody Allen freak out- you know, we're all going to die. And he would just give this very dry little whistle or something like wooh.

Well, what happened, Michele, is I ran into him at a social occasion, and I had just come back from several trips to Trenton, where he was born and spent his early years. And he got intrigued by what I was finding. __EOS__ Were you pulling a bit of Hansel and Gretel on him? That you would just dole out a little bit more information in one interview and a little bit more in the second interview to keep him on the line? __EOS__ That is a very interesting question because I never thought of it that way. But indeed, I was always bringing him something. I was bringing him documents from the immigration service that his father and grandfather had signed. I was bringing him things from the Nixon and Ford archives, the administrations where he worked. I was bringing him information to illicit information. ",0
51809," I think oddly enough, whereas psychiatrists and mental health professionals have always talked about the stigma of mental disorder, we have a growing stigma for feeling intense sadness. Partly, this is a result of the mental health professions themselves having redefined depressive disorder so that it encompasses an enormous range of intense human emotion, some of which I think are normal. __EOS__ And again, we want to point out, of course, depression can be a very serious illness. __EOS__ Absolutely. This is the first thing one has to say that depression is a serious illness. It can even be life-threatening. If one has a depressive disorder, one should seek treatment. One should seek consultation if one is in doubt. __EOS__ Let's - I wanted to read an e-mail we got from an anonymous e-mailer in Indiana. Last July my 8-year-old daughter died of cancer.

Ten years old. __EOS__ It's kind of amazing, like very few relationships withstand the test of time from middle school to adulthood. __EOS__ I remember the first conversation we ever had was in -because we ended up in the same class. It was Miss O'Connor's class. And I met Mike pretty much the first week in school and then we, you know, he just ended up coming over to the house all the time and we just became really close. You know, I think somehow I think sometimes my father dying and Mike coming into my life at the same time sort of coincided. __EOS__ So Tre Cool, who's the drummer with the band, he grew up in an unusual way. He grew up in a home without electricity, no television, I dont know if he had radio or probably not a stereo or anything. So I think, stop me if I'm wrong here, that his father was a veteran who wanted to kind of like move away from the world when he got home and that's why they moved to like a mountain or something? Is that close to... ",2
51820," So when it came time for you to begin having a family, did you know right from the start, I really only want one? Or did that - is that something that came on you and your husband gradually? I mean, how did you arrive at that decision?__EOS__ Well, I think of children as, you know, something that happens one at a time. I, you know, I think that because I'm an only child myself, it's normal to me, and it didn't feel like such a huge jump to make that choice. So we started with one, and then we saw where we were at, and where we were at was a very, very happy place. And that's where we continue to be.__EOS__ Yeah. And is that something that could change? Or, I mean, I don't mean to say, are you going to have another one? Because that's the question you hate, right, or think shouldn't really be asked.__EOS__ No, no - I mean, hey, I wrote a book about this. I am opening up that question.",0
51821," Sacha Baron Cohen, Larry Charles, welcome back to FRESH AIR. I love the film, and it's a pleasure to talk with you. Sacha, how did you create Bruno, and how did Bruno change for the movie? __EOS__ Bruno was probably the first character that I developed. He came before Ali G and before Borat, and it was, I think it was 1996, and I knew that I wanted to do a character in a real setting, and it was coming up to London Fashion Week, and I'd been employed by a channel, a little cable channel in England called the Paramount Comedy Channel, to do, you know, little three-minute sections, and I wanted to do a character that would play in a real way in London Fashion Week, and so I just came up with a fashion reporter who was Austrian. __EOS__ And gay. __EOS__ And gay. Well ",1
51822," I'm glad to be here, Renee. __EOS__ How unusual is it for a U.S. attorney to be fired? __EOS__ It's very unusual. Richard Nixon fired one when he was in office. Carter fired a U.S. attorney who was making an investigation of a Democratic House member that he wanted to keep in office. Bill Clinton fired one. But it's really very rare for this to happen. __EOS__ And for this to happen where it's not just one? In this case, it was eight attorneys. ",3
51823,"  Don't lay that on me. When Sal and his crew were squeezing you for the payments, I didn't hear you wishing I was a law school student then. Not one word from you back then. Where'd you think that money was coming from, Donald Trump?__EOS__  That was a mistake.__EOS__  Well, let's just forget it then.__EOS__  There were lots of mistakes. I should've stopped drinking when your mother passed.",1
51824,"  One more thing  You do not touch the N.O.K. Avoid physical contact with the next of kin, unless its a medical emergency, like if theyre having a heart attack or something. You are representing the secretary of the Army, not Will Montgomery. So in case you feel like offering a hug or something - dont. It will only get you in trouble. __EOS__ Woody Harrelson, welcome to FRESH AIR. This new film is about casualty notification officers, those who bring the tragic news of the loss of a service member to the members of their family. What did you do to get to know that world and the people who have that job? __EOS__ Well, fortunately, we got an opportunity. One of our first road trips was to go to Walter Reed Hospital. And we spent some time with the men and women there and  although, its one of those ironic things because you think going there, youre going to see a lot of people who are - obviously have been injured, lost legs, have been burned or blinded and you think, you know, youre going to be really depressed. But Ive got to say, it was one of the more uplifting experiences I ever had with some men and women who just blew my mind. They were just amazing people. So __EOS__ You know, I dont remember you playing a soldier a lot in the past. Talk a little about getting into that character of Captain Tony Stone - I mean, the physical transformation, the way you carry yourself as an Army captain. ",1
51825," Talk about that in context of ""The Daily Show,"" because it's interesting  you're doing the same things and arguably it has more reach. __EOS__ Right. Well, the most effective I feel on that show is when I am standing on the fence between cultures and when I'm speaking as that sort, quote-unquote, brown correspondent. You know, these Muslim organizations or whatever, they'll come up to me and they'll say, you know, the kind of bridging and outreach that we're trying to do over years and years, you know, you're able to do it in a three-minute sketch. You're able to make that point more succinctly than we are in all of our sort of programs that we do. __EOS__ That's actor Aasif Mandvi. He can be seen as a correspondent on ""The Daily Show"" and in his new film, ""Today's Special,"" which is currently in limited release in theaters across the country. __EOS__ Thank you very much.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",1
51826," Well, you talk a lot about mis-definitions of compassion and that we tend to see it as pity. __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ And it's not that. __EOS__ Indeed. I mean, I think that's - it's fallen out. Caroline is right. It seems to have fallen out of our lexicon. When I was in Holland recently, I gave a talk on compassion. I specifically said  Compassion does not mean feeling sorry for people. And yet in the Dutch translation of my talk in the newspaper, every time I used the word compassion, it was translated pity. This is ingrained in us. ",0
51827," So what did it mean to you in 1968 to have a Broadway show, to be on Broadway? Was that important to you? __EOS__ Well, it was important to me. And I think it was the most fun time I had on any project I've done. I don't know if Burt will feel the same way, but... __EOS__ If I hadn't gotten sick, I would have had a good time. __EOS__ You know, by the time we did the cast album, I was just looking to get to Palm Springs and not touch a piano for a while. So we should have written another one, but should've and would've and could've, we don't count that, Hal. ",2
51828," For a couple of reasons. The biggest reason is there was an election in Iran, and you have a new president by the name of Khatami who's elected, and he seems much more pragmatic. He makes early openings to the West to try to improve relations. And regarding Khobar Towers, when the U.S. sends an inquiry putting Iran on notice through the Omanis, Khatami responds with an interesting line, which is  Well, we had nothing to do with it, but it will not happen again.__EOS__ That's funny  We didn't do it, but it won't happen again. So that was an opening. Do you think if it wasn't for Khatami, there would have been more military action?__EOS__ Yes, I think absolutely. The Clinton administration, I think, was gearing up for a pretty substantial military strike. They developed the first major war plan since the Kuwaiti tankers operations about 10 years earlier. So I think yeah, absolutely, we were gearing up for a conflict had Khatami not been elected, and it seemed like a new opening. And Khatami sacked one of the MOIS, who's Iran's intelligence service, one of their senior commanders who was probably involved in the bombing of Khobar Towers.__EOS__ The U.S. has had several secret war plans to attack Iran. What's the earliest one that you came across?",0
51829,"  What about the offspring?  Was it a genius factory? __EOS__  It was not a genius factory.  I ended up being in touch with      about 30 of the kids out of 215 total.  And in general, the kids are      above-average students, but there's a wide range.  There are some who are      below; there are some who have some serious health problems.  I think the      important question to ask about the Nobel Prize sperm bank is what kind      of woman goes to a Nobel Prize sperm bank, and the kind of woman who goes      there is bound and determined to have an accomplished child.  I think      they would have had accomplished children whether they'd gone to the      Nobel Prize sperm bank or whether they'd gone to Joe's discount sperm      warehouse.  It didn't make a difference. __EOS__  Robert Graham died in 1997.  His sperm bank was shut down two      years later.  Do you think it left a legacy, though? __EOS__  It left a huge legacy.  When Robert Graham came along and offered      the Godiva of sperm, it changed the way women thought about this process      of infertility, and they stopped being patients and they started being      consumers, and I think that's the greatest change that Robert Graham      brought to America.

51830," Phillips says her mother didn't talk a lot about the murders, which took place when she was a child. But whenever they drove near the area where the crime occurred, she would say, there's the road to Quiet Dell. Phillips says she had a strong connection to the sensory details of the story.__EOS__ Oh, the long dusty road, the heat of August, cars lined up as far as you could see, being very small and huge crowds of people, hearing the sound of them taking apart the murder garage for souvenirs. The whole experience was something that stayed with me.__EOS__ Two women were killed at Quiet Dell by the murderer Harry Powers, but so were the three children of one of the women, Asta Eicher, a widow from Chicago. Phillips opens the book with a vivid portrait of the family, imagining what their lives might have been like in the weeks before they were killed. Phillips says she felt a responsibility to the children.__EOS__ The tragedy of their loss was somehow answered for me in the process of writing them. They became real to me and alive and saved, in a sense.",0
51831," You know, the way they treated you the first time. Let's take a pause... __EOS__ No. They weren't rude. They weren't rude. They just weren't jumping out of their chairs to make a film together. __EOS__ They were Hollywood. They were Hollywood, weren't they? __EOS__ They are not Hollywood. ",1
51832,  You going to ride with me?__EOS__  You can take me to my grandma. You can stay if you want.__EOS__ Writer-director Aurora Guerrero was 13 when she met the girl whose friendship inspired the film.__EOS__ It was what I look back on as a really beautiful love story that we had when we were young.,1
51833," Yeah, global warming's equally evil twin, exactly. And from the perspective of, you know, the broad expanse of life, there have been a few moments in time where the oceans have become acidified, not necessarily acidic but acidified, so more and more acidified, and they are associated with some of the major crises in the history of life.__EOS__ To help you understand the impact of the acidification of the oceans, you went to a tiny island that has naturally occurring gas bubbles, and there's carbon dioxide in those gas bubbles. So what kinds of experiments are going on in this island?__EOS__ Well that's a really interesting story, and it involves a great guy whom I went out with named Jason Hall-Spencer, who's a British marine biologist. And he came to this idea, just sort of almost by chance. He went swimming off of this tiny island, as you say, and it - which is in the Bay of Naples. It's off of Ischia in Italy.__EOS__ So if our oceans ended up looking like the area where there's these naturally occurring gas vents are, what would our oceans end up looking like?",0
51834," The name was - came about from a nickname that my parents gave me when I was younger. I was extremely socially awkward as a child and to the point of basically sitting in a corner all kids' social occasions. I didn't really want to talk to anyone, so I'd have this frankly terrified look on my face, I think. And it was  it came from that moment that they used to call me frightened rabbit because of that wide-eyed glare that I'd be giving the room must, you know, just wanted to get out of there. __EOS__ When did that change? __EOS__ Part of it stays with me today. But I've been forced into change. You know, to live my life, you have to get on. And especially now I've learned how to deal with that kind of situation. But even now, you know, throw me into a party full of strangers and I'll sink for sure. I don't deal with it well. __EOS__ Back to being a frightened rabbit. ",2
51835, There's a passage where you give us kind of the back story on Skink. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ Is Skink your alter ego in this book? Is he what you might be if you were a totally deranged madman? __EOS__ What do you mean if I was a totally... ,0

She got us up to check it out.",1
51837," I think my favorite scene is quite near the beginning where they're drunk and hallucinating from lack of food, and they have to go into the kitchen - because they're trying to make a cup of tea - and the sink is full of dirty dishes and Paul McGann is convinced that there's something alive living in the kitchen sink.__EOS__  Listen to me. Listen. There are things in there. There's a tea bag growing.__EOS__ And so Richard E. Grant puts on these big rubber gloves and is going in to attack whatever is living in the sink.__EOS__  Stand aside.",1
51838," I don't see that as taking the choice away. People still have the choice. Right now, the default is junk food. How about making the default healthy food? People can always order junk food if they want to. Nobody is stopping them from doing that. __EOS__ Is there a way to make healthy food the default and junk food a treat, or should junk food just not be a choice at all? __EOS__ Oh, I think junk food has a place in American diets. __EOS__ I have my own favorites, and everybody does. Nobody is talking about trying to get rid of these foods. These foods are not cigarettes. With cigarettes, the issue is very simple. You just want people to stop smoking, and if you had the choice, you would put cigarette companies out of business. ",3
51839," Thanks for having me. __EOS__ Now, how did you get involved in a documentary about this? This is the kind of thing that, you know, it seems like it would be a snooze fest. __EOS__ Yeah. And a lot of people along the way, as I was trying to make the film, said, well, how are you going to make a movie about redistricting? It's so super boring. But I heard about this anecdote in 2003 where a bunch of Texas legislators, about 52 of them, got on buses in the middle of the night and fled to Oklahoma and hid out in the Holiday Inn for four days, basically to stop a re-redistricting of the state led by then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. __EOS__ Why is it called gerrymandering? And gerrymandering doesn't refer to a process of simply drawing the lines. That refers to an abuse of the process, correct? ",3
51840," Seems to have calmed down right now. __EOS__ Yeah, she's gone back to sleep. __EOS__ Oh, good. Well, I'm glad we didn't disturb her too much by doing the interview. And thank you very much for coming in to member station WCBE. __EOS__ Well, thank you for having me. ",3

51843,"  Left the city. My mama, she said, don't come back home... __EOS__ As an independent artist, Janelle Monae created buzz back in 2007, when she released a seven-song collection called ""Metropolis."" Monae's music and her persona are hard to pin down. She plays indie rock festivals and the R&B circuit. She often sports tuxedos and a sky-high pompadour. And her musical influences seem to include a blend of James Brown, David Bowie, Nona Hendryx and Kraftwerk. __EOS__ A lot of the people that I was hanging out with didn't really have a lot of goals. And I felt myself ending up walking dead, and so that's when I realized that I could actually go away and show that just because you come from a small, little town in Kansas, which is the poorest county, that you definitely have a choice. __EOS__  Daydreamers, please wake up, we can't sleep no more.

51844," I imagine what you describe as you Zelig-like personality was a real asset as an actor, if you're naturally just picking up accents from where you are and characteristics of the people you're around. __EOS__ Yeah. I think so. Although, I don't - you know, it's never crafty, you know, the way I do it. And ironically, it seems like a lot of the characters I wind up playing are not like anybody. You know, they're unusual people. __EOS__ True. __EOS__ So you would think, yeah. But I'm not - it's different than, like - it's different than mimicry, you know what I mean? ",3
51845," I think there's a sense of which he's trying to reconcile his younger self from his present self, which I think is a pretty common story. Except that he has done this damaging giant act toward the end of his adolescence that leaves this physical trace of the breach right at the point at which he crossed from who he was into some new thing.__EOS__ Is there a part of you in that younger Sean who was so rash - who got so damaged by this terrible act?__EOS__ Oh, sure, absolutely. I mean, there's a - it took me years to come around to the idea that you're always writing a little bit about yourself in any character you write because that's the only personality you really know inside and out is your own. But I mean, I think about when I was having this very turbulent adolescence. And several times I fled home, right?__EOS__ Well, and that's one of the things about this book that you explore, and you explore it through this game that you have invented and that Sean plays. First, let's talk about that game. What is the game?",2
51846," It's just interviewers, actually, yeah, it is. Most musicians are more concerned about the music and what you do with it than where you're from. __EOS__ You've got some tight horn arrangements on this CD. You responsible for that? __EOS__ Actually, the horn arrangements were done by Mike Rinta. In the past I would probably have a little more influence on the horns, but this man is well-versed in the style of music of all different genres, of classic R&B and soul. So I handed him a demo tape of some of the songs that we were working on and I said go to town. And about a week before we were supposed to do the recording, he invited me over to his apartment to check out what he had done and I made very little changes in anything that he had put together. __EOS__ Let's listen to a clip from the song ""You Know."" ",2
51847," You described her as a gambler, an actual gambler. __EOS__ An actual - I was just about breast-fed at a poker table. I could remember many nights sleeping under the poker table and finding chips on the floor that I would pocket. While my mother would go broke, I would hand her some chips. __EOS__ The young David Pearlman was a street kid, and he raised his own kids to be working nomads, a family of buskers who came to call themselves The Flying Neutrinos - a band that, by the way for his grown-up kids, now has a hip following. Poppa Neutrino's own story might have continued as a collection of colorful moments lived with a certain brio until he did something both ridiculous and heroic. __EOS__ Wherever David goes, he looks for a raft to build to live on, and David built a raft from some things that had been - that they were throwing out on the harbor there. ",0
51848," Well, no, but I actually agree with that. I think that if a state believes that someone has learned their lesson and their voting rights should be restored, I think that their gun rights and all these other rights that have been taken away should also be restored.__EOS__ OK. Spencer Overton?__EOS__ The attorney general's speech focused on restoring voting rights. When I was at the Justice Department working for Eric Holder, I led a team that focused on reentry. And one of the issues we focused on was collateral consequences, not just voting - but there are a variety of them - and changing them so that people can, when they get out of prison, they can become barbers and many states have rules that prevent them from becoming barbers and there are a whole other, a range...__EOS__ So you're saying that's a separate issue?",3
51849," Patrick, when you go overseas now - 'cause you, obviously, you're a foreign correspondent; you write for the Independent - do you have some anxiety about leaving Henry behind? __EOS__ Yes, about every five seconds, yes. You know, I worry about it the whole time. And I try and sort of reduce the worry, but it's difficult. I mean, Henry, you know, things are going much better now but it's very difficult to sort of get memories out of your head. I mean, Henry feels, you know, that his life was never - he was never close to death, or he certainly wasn't trying to commit suicide. __EOS__ And let me ask you, Henry, do you feel like you're cured? __EOS__ Yeah, uh-huh. ",0
51850," So, in a sense, even before this album, you've been collaborating, one way or another for a long, your families have.__EOS__ Sure, yeah. My father was an accordion player back in the late '50s and '60s. You know, I remember, it was actually my dad's bass player at that age, about 9 years old.__EOS__ At the age of 9 you were your father's bass player?__EOS__ Yeah, I was actually his bass player at 9, yeah, you know. And so my mom hated it because she wanted me to go to school. And I went to school, you know, but I'd play on the weekends with my dad, you know. But come Monday morning, man, she couldn't get me up to go to school, you know.",1
51851," I wonder if some of that Juilliard training doesn't come through in a clip we want to play now, ""Ritual Fire Dance.""__EOS__ Well, the great orchestral composition by Manuel de Falla. I think Tito's Juilliard training came out in all of the things that he did. This is a great example of his knowledge of Afro-Cuban rhythm and his knowledge of the orchestra.__EOS__ Let's listen to a little bit of ""Ritual Fire Dance."" Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra.__EOS__ Now to compare and contrast, Tito Puente and his concert orchestra.",2
51852," Yes. __EOS__ Unconnected to this, apparently. But also what's going to happen to your client now? __EOS__ Well, he's charged again, and we're back in many ways at the same place because of the MCA that Rosemary talked about. And so the war goes on. I mean civil rights and the battle for civil rights is continuous because there will always been a tension between security and civil rights. This is the nature of the document. What I am committed to doing is to make sure that the courts aren't cut out of that battle. Because if they are, it's over. __EOS__ Charles Swift, thanks very much for being with us. Lieutenant Commander Charles Swift represented Salim Ahmed Hamdan. He joins private life shortly as he leaves the United States Navy. ",3
51853," Okay. What happens at a ferret bash? __EOS__ Well, it's a championship ferret show. The ferrets are actually judged much like any dog or cat show. They're judged for conformation, maintenance, disposition. You bite the judge, you get disqualified. And there's fun events, were the tube racing, the best dressed, vendors galore. It keeps people busy all day. __EOS__ But when you say you judge them on conformation, that is conformation to standards. At a dog show, a - you know, a Golden Retriever should be between so many inches tall at the withers and - if it's a male and so much for a female, and you penalize them if they're not. Are there such standards for ferrets? __EOS__ There are set standards by the American Ferret Association. They set the standards for what we are judging for. The head needs to be a certain width and depth. There needs to have a certain amount of bone density. Their coat has to be in good condition, and then their maintenance and disposition. ",3
51854," You're saying that they didn't put enough in, or what happened? __EOS__ You can say that they didn't put enough in or they paid too much or when - the problems were exacerbated when the economic downturn of a couple years ago that really hit the stock market, investment markets took a hit as well. So it's a combination of factors that have all driven the insolvency of that pension fund. __EOS__ Mr. Arnold, how did you find out or how long had you been retired before the pension checks stopped? __EOS__ I was retired about three years. I retired in 2008. I was receiving my monthly pension checks every month. All of a sudden we just - we got a letter saying we would not be getting more pension checks. This last one will be the last one. ",3
51855," Okay, Michael Kimmel, let me let you respond to that. Patrick mentioned he's 73. Is there a changing role, or a changing view in society of manhood - what it takes to be a man - that's changed over the generations? __EOS__ Well, let me pose a rhetorical question in response to that, and then try to answer it. Both Kay and I agree that there is a new stage of development and that this is driven by, we said, demography, changes in the economy. Many young men, as earlier callers have suggested, are structurally prevented from developing the kinds of economic security that they feel they need in order to take the next step into adulthood. Some are precluded from doing that by racial discrimination; some by, you know, sort of the changes in the economy. I think Kay is quite right. __EOS__ These days, what does it mean to be a woman? They basically say  Anything I want. And the - what the difference is, that the world has completely changed for men and yet young men today still subscribe  to an ideology of masculinity that they inherited from their fathers and grandfathers. That is to say, it remains relatively the same. And that difference is really a difference between why women are not adrift. __EOS__ I don't know; it's all good. Now, it may be all good. And we don't want to, you know, take away fun and pleasure. But what we've done in our society is, we have made adulthood synonymous with responsibility and sobriety. And we had made not - you know, adolescence or boyhood fun and irresponsible. And who would then want to give that up, you know? People who feel like they have to, that they have no choice. But most guys will say, I want to do this as long as I possibly can. ",0
51856," ...they feel there's no room for creativity or for the expression. But of course that's a misunderstanding, because even if there is a right answer there can be many creative and imaginative ways of getting to the right answer, including wrong ways of getting to the answer that are really interesting. __EOS__ But Josh, why did you stick with it? What kept your attention? __EOS__ Well, actually it's  I failed math in high school. I never thought I'd be a mathematician, but I've always loved physics, but I never thought I could do it. But then  community college later on and our teacher there are really kind of put me under her wing - her name is Juliet Stefanov - she took me under her wing and she explained it to me and she really give me some attention and I just  it like lit a fire in me, and I - it's my favorite subject now. __EOS__ Well, that's cool, all right.

And that wasn't something that I really understood before. The usual dichotomy is between nature or nurture, and the more we look into DNA, the more we're realizing it's really nature and nurture.

But it is interesting to me that you wrote it in the context of the ideologies of two contrasting religions being almost identical.__EOS__ Well, my point was that the - there was this long clash between Christendom and Islam, and the clash arose in many respects more from their resemblances than from their differences.

51860," Before most readers in China learned of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" they were captivated by a love triangle between a boy and his two female cousins.__EOS__ This is the single most famous love triangle in Chinese literary history.__EOS__ That was Pauline Chen.__EOS__ And I'm the author of ""The Red Chamber.""",0
51861," I want to play ""Feel Love"" simply because it does seem to give a nod to earlier in your timeline and the evolution of your work. First, let's hear a little bit of it. __EOS__  I given up, I've given in, given out and back again. Now that we're in from the cold, our days are made of gold. When we feel love, we sleep and share the same dream love. When we feel love... __EOS__ Would you say you're going back to basics on this song? __EOS__ Yeah. ",2
51862," Thank you very much for having me. __EOS__ Now, before we start listening, this whole collection started just as a personal collection, is that right? __EOS__ Yeah, I was a DJ - a very bad club DJ and a pretty good radio DJ -and by the time I finished writing a book on punk and new wave music, I had about 47,000 recordings. And I tried to give them away and tried to find somebody who was interested in what I had, which was mostly at the time punk, hip-hop and reggae - and was pretty much told that this wasn't music and it was not worth saving. __EOS__ Who told you it wasn't music?

51863," Drift never makes the case that war might be necessary and America would be weakened dramatically if we under-reacted to 911; however, Rachel Maddow makes valid arguments that our country has been drifting toward questionable wars, draining our resources, without sufficient input and time. People who like Rachel will love the book; people who don't will get angry, but aggressive debate is good for America. ""Drift"" is a book worth reading.__EOS__ You know, I asked him and I did not know that he would say yes.__EOS__ Really? You asked him?__EOS__ Yeah.",0
51864," Why were people utilizing these rogue pain clinics? Is it that people are just looking for another way to get high? Or were people utilizing them because they felt that they were out of options. If they  people were legitimately in pain, looking for some help with pain management and felt that the legitimate sources were just not hearing them? How did this start? __EOS__ I think that they were probably a combination of customers or patients at these clinics. Some of them actually did have legitimate pain. But as these things sort of took off, the draw was far and away higher among people who were seeking drugs for illegal purposes. __EOS__ How big is the volume that we're talking about? How big of a phenomenon is this? If you could give us some sense of it. __EOS__ It's huge. There was a single clinic that was raided here in Palm Beach County in March. And federal investigators determined that each of the five doctors who were working at the clinic dispensed about half a million pills in 2009 alone. A lot of these clinics would see up to 200 patients per day and a typical prescription or a typical amount of pills that they would walk away with is anything from 150 to 200 Oxycodone tablets, 60 Xanax. They were prescribing Valiums, things like that. ",3
51865," Right. __EOS__ And they also then need the particular type of environment that they have in Mexico, in the highlands of Michoacan in Mexico State, to over winter. And one of the things that I do in the book is look at a crazy couple of guys who, for the last dozen years or so, have been, on their own, trying to reforest that area. A million trees a year, they're planting now. __EOS__ And trying to plant them faster than other people can cut them down? __EOS__ Because there again… ",0

I wake up in the morning Tell you what I see on my TV screen I see the blood of an innocent child And everbody's watching... __EOS__ Talk about the song ""Fire in the Mountain."" This is another example of social justice lyrics, isn't it? __EOS__ Yes. Yes. ""Fire on the Mountain"" has talked about lot of things that we all know, we are familiarized with, from war to pedophile to diamond blood, you know, to many things, many more, you know. Really, what I'm talking about there is I'm trying to make us aware of what we already know but we are scared to talk about or to approach. __EOS__  You don't even know him ",2
51867,"   __EOS__ So, Jasmine, just give us a little translation. __EOS__ Well, believe it or not, this is actually a song that is very festive and very danceable. But it has a political message in it. It's talking about la guagua va en reversa, which means the bus is going backwards. And it's kind of talking about society and government. __EOS__ Yeah. I think we get it. ",2
51868," Now, there were a few weird coincidences that Bob Conte noticed over the years, before the bunker's existence was exposed by the Washington Post in 1992. For one thing, there were many, many, many bathrooms - and most of them were facilities for men. __EOS__ So for that 30 years, you had to make sure all the filters were changed; all the pharmaceuticals were up-to-date; all the food was ready to go. __EOS__ And they had to keep a six-month supply of food that was periodically refreshed. __EOS__ If you're a normal member of Congress, my guess is that you know nothing. You really know nothing. ",3
51869," Speech says the group had begun to lose sight of itself, and its audience. __EOS__ There's this machinery of advertising, of all types of different promotional techniques that the machinery of the music industry does, and after awhile you're not exactly sure how you're gaining new audiences. So when we were losing them, we were also perplexed. Like, how are we losing the audience? What did we do differently? __EOS__ As it turns out, it wasn't what they were doing differently so much as it was what they hadn't caught on to  the emergence of gangster rap. __EOS__ There was a change in taste. It was a different style of hip-hop, talking on some more “raw” topics. It interested people in a different way than what Arrested Development did. ",3
51870," Well, you know, I've actually been pretty surprised of how good everything has been with the press coverage on this, but, you know, that was something that I was concerned about, how would it affect my life, my career, all of those things, my family. __EOS__ You mentioned that you were - you're - as part of this documentary, there's a sequence in it where you've already announced your decision that you are making - you've announced that you're making the transition, and, well, here's just an excerpt of some of the media coverage. __EOS__ There's one transgender person you've probably have heard of. Chaz Bono who was born... __EOS__ Chastity Bono, the daughter of Sonny and Cher, made a surprise announcement. ",1
51871," Wow. Well, you have a computer with you, right? __EOS__ That's right. __EOS__ Okay. And youve loaded up some musical examples? __EOS__ Sure. Sure. Sure. I mean the first thing to realize is that if you just listen to a simple sound, you know, so like this... ",2
51872," So what they're trying to do is sort eliminate the subjectivity. Instead of judging the thing that happened by the outcome, they're sort of looking at the process that led to the outcome. The end result of all this is that the Oakland A's are forced, because they don't have any money, to build a team from players, out of players, that the other teams don't value, because if the other teams do value them, the Oakland A's can't afford them. __EOS__ So they're forced to find a way to find the hidden value in players, and they have built this team out of players that other teams often had no interest in at all and always had much less interest in, and that this group of, you know, rejected parts from other organizations has come together and become this juggernaut on the field was to me the really astonishing thing. __EOS__ Why don't you describe one of the - how one of the players signed to the Oakland A's became a big success with the A's but hadn't been thought of as a great player before joining the A's. __EOS__ There are plenty of examples, but, well, let's take one of the characters in the book, Scott Hatteberg. Scott Hatteberg had spent 10 years in the Boston Red Sox organization, four of them in the minor leagues and I guess almost six of them in the big leagues. He'd been a catcher, and the Red Sox viewed him as a catcher who, you know, wasn't a disaster as a hitter, and that was because they didn't value what he did really well. ",3
51873," It was - they call it Kaliningrad now. They renamed it after...__EOS__ Yeah, exactly. It's Kaliningrad, and Kaliningrad is part of Russia even though it is an island of Russian sovereignty surrounded by Poland and, I believe, Lithuania and perhaps Latvia. And, you know, this is very strategic for Russia. Russia's put more troops there. It's - you know, it's got naval base possibilities. It gives Russia a frontage on the Baltic, which it would not have as much without it. And it's part - and it helps Russia project power into the Baltic States.__EOS__ Well, thanks very much for the call.__EOS__ The 30 billion pounds...",0
51874," Now, in this presidential race, the most prominent call you've made that you would call a hard call is your steadfast support of the war in Iraq. How do you hold to that position when so many voters, even some of your Republican colleagues in the Senate, have come around to that position that it's time for American troops to start coming home? __EOS__ Because every bit of knowledge and instinct, awareness and confidence that I have makes me believe absolutely that setting a date for withdrawal will result in chaos and genocide in the region, and we will then have to call on young Americans to make even greater sacrifices. And as you pointed out, a lot of Americans' patience were exhausted by the failed strategy that I bitterly opposed, predicted would fail, and called for the new strategy that we have finally implemented and is now winning. I want us out, too, but I have said on a number of occasions that I would rather lose a campaign than lose a war. __EOS__ Towards the issue though of winning, even the American military said this mission cannot be sustained over time. Is it possible that there is some wishful thinking on your part that this could really work? __EOS__ It is working. This military, this Guard and Reserve, are badly overstretched but they are winning, and I believe that they will if given the time to do so. Come next spring, I think decisions will probably need to be made, depending on our troop levels and depending on the success. But I think it's long, and hard, and difficult. ",0
51875," Well, why did you buy it? You bought it when Studio City shut down. Why?__EOS__ Well, I'll tell you. It might sound ridiculous to be so emotionally attached to a board that's just a big hunk of metal and knobs, but I look at it like it's the house I grew up in, you know? If you had the opportunity to buy the house that you grew up in, that you became yourself in - anyone would do that, I think. And I looked at it that way. And to be reunited with this thing, I was just - it was beyond me. I just - I couldn't believe it. And so I didn't even ask how much it cost. I said, absolutely because I really did imagine this thing was going to wind up in the Hall of Fame.__EOS__ Well, Dave Grohl, it's been really fun to talk to you. Thank you so much.__EOS__ Awesome. Thank you a lot.",2
51876,"  Oh hi, Joe.__EOS__  Hi, Oz. Close the door, will you?__EOS__  What's the matter?__EOS__  Clara's on her way over here, and there's something I want to talk to you about before she gets here.",3
51877," Well, you know, I've known Chris for quite some times. We're dear friends. And the very first movie I ever did, independent film I ever did - you know, I'm queen of the independents. But the very first one I ever did was with Chris Cooper. We called ""Pharaoh's Army."" __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ A beautiful, little film shot in Danville, Kentucky for $350,000 and that was 1995, and he's a magnificent man, and so a lot of the homework was done because I have such an emotional connection to him as a friend. But I just also adore him - and Pat truly does adore Harry - and so that came easily. I think she really - she likes Harry. I think she struggled with love for him, and I think that's what's maybe kind of beautiful about this film is I think these are two people who maybe actually have real love at the end of the film after 25 years. But they go through a lot to get there. __EOS__ Yes. ",3
51878," Jim Baggett, it's a delight to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today. __EOS__ Well, good afternoon, thank you. __EOS__ And I guess I should not have been surprised, but I guess I was, to read in Michele's book that of course the provision of the retention of legal documents in Birmingham, Alabama, well, it's something that is done through the lens of race. __EOS__ It is, and when Michele and I first talked, I think I warned her, probably more than I needed to...

51881," Thanks for having me.__EOS__ You know, such a well-known play, but I'm afraid I don't think I've ever heard the story of how you came to write ""August  Osage County.""__EOS__ It's based on family history. My grandfather - my mother's father - committed suicide when I was 10 years old. And my grandmother descended into years of downer addiction, which had a horrible impact on my family and has ripples in my family even to this day. And watching all of that unfold as a 10-year-old certainly had an impact on me.__EOS__ So, I wonder, the character Beverly, the poet, the - I think we refer to him as the patriarch of the clan - who was, as I recall, even your father played him, didn't he...",1

51883," The first line I think is a line that the actual guy said, that Christian Bale and I interfaced with a little bit, Christian more so than me. There's a lot of specific language you pick up when you're in Lowell, Massachusetts, or, you know, Ridley Park, you know, outside Philly, Upper Darby or in these neighborhoods in New York around this Mel Weinberg character. So he said that line.__EOS__ Several of the main characters in ""American Hustle"" want to or need to reinvent themselves. The movie starts with the Christian Bale character looking in the mirror, gluing on his toupee, and it's a really awful toupee.__EOS__ And we see...__EOS__ It's not a toupee. No, it's his own hair.",3
51884," Oh, this I can't tell you, but definitely, I think Steffani was very accurate the way he wrote the music for the instrument. And he's really a master of creating atmosphere, incredible atmosphere before an aria starts. So he was a genius . So I hope this project, of course, this recording, but also, I'm going to perform is music on stage, and I hope the people will get this.__EOS__ And will you be able to get a major opera house to stage an entire Steffani opera?__EOS__ Well, I hope so.__EOS__ I try. I try. What I can say then when I did my Vivaldi album in '99, at that time, Vivaldi was well-known but not as the opera composer of 18th century, the greatest. And, in fact, I did an album with only opera arias, and this was such a huge success then many singers and opera houses and they start to perform the music of Vivaldi and - to making records, you know, entire records of operas of Vivaldi. And they started to perform Vivaldi on stage, operas. So which I hope this was - my contribution helped on that so - and I hope the same with Steffani.",2
51885," Daniel, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it. __EOS__ You're welcome, thank you for having this show. __EOS__ OK, here's a follow-up from Alison in Schwartz Creek, Michigan  How do you handle the petty jealousies that arise among the wives? Alina, I think that's to you. __EOS__ Yeah, definitely, and those do arise because you can imagine living together every day and the numerous circumstances that would come up. And again, it goes back to - and we address those a lot in ""Love Times Three,"" but it goes back to the key elements of the faith and the trust. And sometimes, you just have to go power through it and communicate and talk to each other. ",0
51886," Several people, I've noticed, have misread this cut as something we put together. I want to make it clear, this was a live cut, part of an album that he cut on me, a spiritual, kind of Southern rock gospel album, which will someday come out. I've got Johnny Cash on it and a number of people. And we cut it in the studio with Tony Joe, myself and Waylon, but Waylon just did a velvet, ohh, what an incredible vocal he did on this. __EOS__  It took your sweet love, Sweet love, to bring me out of the cave, I believe that I can make it now, I can make it, yeah, I feel I belong, Out of the rain, Out of the rain. __EOS__ But the last song on the disc really does seem to be looking ahead at the end of this, this journey that you take us over the course of these, these 12 songs. It's a song that has a gospel feel and it's a song that was co-written by yourself and your son, Shooter. __EOS__ Yes. ",3
51887," Here's the excerpt of my interview with Mike Wallace.__EOS__ One of the things you've become best known for in your ""60 Minutes"" interviews is not only the tough interview but what's been described as the ambush interview, where the camera person walks in with the camera running...__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ ...and the person doesn't want to be interviewed but the camera man's there with the camera on and you see the person waving the camera away and putting their hands in front of their faces...",3

51889," Well, I think that's right. And Eliot, of course, was very interested in popular music. He was always interested in musical constructs. We remember that some of his very early poems were called preludes, and of course, we recall that his later poems were known as ""Four Quartets."" So, musical structures have always been very significant in his poetry. In this particular case, I think of this as a night at the music hall, with various people showing up and doing a little turn, a lot of comedians showing up, and, you know, giving some sense of the London of that era, in all its raunchiness, of course, and also in all its splendor.__EOS__ What is there in this what we think of as the almost the definitive 20th century poem that keeps it alive for a 21st century reader?__EOS__ It has never lost its glamour. It has never failed to be equal to both the fracture of its own era and what, alas, turned out to be the even greater fracture of the ongoing 20th century and now, it seems, the 21st century.__EOS__ Paul, is there a section of the poem you could read for us, you'd like to read for us?",0
51890," As quickly as possible and as far away as possible. I think the military people have to tell you how fast you can do it safely, but it wouldn't be one of these things to wait six months to start to do it. I would do it immediately; I would certainly move the Navy away from the shores of Iran - and intimidating Iran and trying to provoke them and spread the war. And you could immediately start bringing troops home. Of course, in the overall foreign policy, I'd like to bring the troops home from most of the other places around the world, too.__EOS__ Really, get the troops back on American soil is what you propose?__EOS__ That is correct. That is correct.__EOS__ Withdraw the Navy from the Persian Gulf?",3
51891," I know. That's why it was so stupid of me. Are you trying to illustrate how I was getting out of control here, Robert? Because, clearly, some days I was spending way too much time reading those things. __EOS__ Well, there is a point at the beginning of Sherrod Brown's campaign where you realize that this man that you'd been married to for a couple of years is being branded; he's about to be sold in a variety of products. And that he, having served in Congress, and had been Ohio secretary of state, he's accepted this long ago. He's, by no means, a cynical politician, a very, very... __EOS__ No. __EOS__ ...rigorously principled guy. But he's used to this thing and you're not. ",0
51892," Let's talk about the history of Bryan Fischer's political influence. He hasn't always been a radio host. In 2001, Republican leaders appointed him the chaplain of the Idaho State Senate. What kind of influence did that give him politically?__EOS__ Well, it gave him a statewide platform in Idaho and it made him kind of the spokesman for social conservatism in the state, so the media would go to him for quotes on things. I mean his background, to go back one step, is he was trained as a - he went to theological seminary in Dallas, at a very conservative seminary, and before that he went to Stanford as an undergraduate. And he's extremely bright. He's bright. He's articulate. He's smart. He's funny. Quick. And he's just a natural spokesman for his cause. And so he went from having his own pulpit in Idaho, where actually, he was very controversial, to then being appointed to being the chaplain for the Senate in Idaho and that gave him a statewide platform.__EOS__ You say in 2005, the congregation that he founded kicked him out. What happened?__EOS__ When I started digging into his background, what I found was there was kind of a pattern of blowups. And in 2005 was when he had his own church and they kicked him out for the same reason that he had been separated from an earlier church that he was at, which was he has this unyielding view that women cannot have any kind of authority over men. And they can't be placed - the church wanted to allow a woman to have some kind of position of authority in the church. She was a friend of the wife of one of the elders in the church, and he absolutely refused...",3
51893," One of the government's arguments was that agents moved in to rescue children that were being sexually assaulted by Koresh. When you testified as an expert witness in front of the congressional committee on Waco - this happened in '95 - you questioned that. Let's play a clip of the statement. __EOS__ I don't understand why two-thirds of the search warrant is about child abuse and statutory rape when the ATF has no jurisdiction over those offenses. __EOS__ Can you explain further what you meant by that statement, Sir? __EOS__ Yes. The ATF is a federal agency and has no authority over sexual offenses, which only the states can prosecute. That's the question I was raising, what authority did the ATF have to look into the question of child abuse? It's authority is over guns. ",0
51894," You know, I agree with that, what Kim's saying, and I think what she raises - the points she raises in her book are really important as Asian-Americans to be talking about because they lead to so many negative sorts of aspects. I mean, growing up, my father was the disciplinarian. He was the one who pushed me to get straight As. If I ever got a B, it was just this level of shame in our home.__EOS__ Jeff Yang, what about you? You've written, also, a lot about this issue and you say you're a modified Tiger cub. Do you want to talk more about that?__EOS__ I'm kind of this lab-grown hybrid of tiger and panda or something. So my parents were very strict. They had very high expectations. They are immigrants. You know, they came to this country explicitly in order to ensure that I would have my best foot forward and eventually end up tangled in ivy in some fashion and, you know, to that extent, they succeeded, but they also succeeded in creating, you know, a journalist, which was probably the last thing on their minds.__EOS__ Kim Wong, do you want to talk more - Kim Wong Keltner - do you want to talk a little bit more about that? I mean I also want to emphasize to people that some of the stories that I might want to recount from the book are very painful. But you do have a light touch and you do talk about how funny they are. But you do give it a funny sort of touch. But do you mind if I just do one story from the book, where you say...",3
51895," And from my point of view of when being a dancer on the show and it was something that I never really thought about until seeing the documentary that he also employed black men and black women in key positions. And I thought it's like, wow, everybody on staff, the camera man, the stage manager, the talent coordinator, it was always a sea of color. And I also think that's important to note as well. __EOS__ How is he, by the way? __EOS__ He's great. On a panel discussion he was so just like up and awake and on. He couldn't just stop talking. __EOS__ Overly candid in some areas, but... ",1
51896," Yes. I think it's just trying to make sense of the riches that you might have and sometimes that you might kind of take for granted while you know that others might be so devastated.__EOS__ There's another lyric in the song and it's the name of the album actually - ""What A Terrible World, What A Beautiful World."" And, wow, I just hear that and I think about some of the events that we've been covering around the world in the last few weeks and months.__EOS__ Yeah. It is just trying to figure out how do these two things go together? It's absurd. You know, how can things be so beautiful and yet so horrible at the same time? And the song and the record, to a certain extent, is me trying to make sense of that.__EOS__  What a terrible world, what a beautiful world, what a world do we make here?",2
51897," You know, to me - maybe I'm wrong - but I always thought the way we were raising our kids was more of a traditional American way - you know, the values of hard work and perseverance, and being taught that you can overcome obstacles, and respect. __EOS__ When did Western parenting become associated with the more permissive style? I think it's pretty recent. I mean, I think maybe the 1960s. So I didn't really think of it as Western versus Chinese. I guess I thought of it as maybe a kind of old-fashioned parenting style. __EOS__ Did you ever clash over this at all? Were there ever any concerns? And  Jed, when I ask you this question, I'm thinking about a moment in the book where you noticed these marks on the piano, and you realize that your very driven daughter was actually gnawing on the piano when her parents weren't looking. __EOS__ Well, you know, we did clash a little bit, but never in front of the kids. It was very important to me, and to Amy, that we presented a united front to the children. So, sometimes I would say to Amy privately that I thought this or that, you know, could be reconsidered.

All of them involve crisis and torment and, frequently, death - sometimes murder and assassination, like in ""Milk."" This is so prosaic and quotidian. This is an ordinary, comfortable kind of inconspicuous and unassuming couple.__EOS__ It's the epic quality of the ordinary. You know, you scratch something ordinary, and then something extraordinary is always - you know, is more often than not, beneath it.__EOS__ Well, John Lithgow and Alfred Molina, thanks so much for talking to us today.__EOS__ It's a great pleasure.

Minnesota Democrat Martin Sabo and New York Republican Sherwood Boehlert have come straight from the House floor. This is their last season here. They're both retiring at the end of the year.

Not seriously as an equal but as that's pretty remarkable that you're this good and you're so young and you're a girl. I mean, that's, I think - was the attitude. But I was always treated with respect.__EOS__ Do you remember the first time you heard one of your records on the radio?__EOS__ Yes. I do.

The Obama administration is expected to release a report - perhaps as soon as tomorrow - outlining its recommendations for protecting online consumer privacy.__EOS__ What I've heard is that it's going to be based on a Commerce Department report, which basically sets forth fair information practices that companies should abide by in the U.S. so that U.S. residents will feel comfortable going on the Web and so the U.S. will be able to deal with Europeans better in terms of how American privacy policies align with European privacy policies.__EOS__ Why is that alignment important?",3
51903," Oh, saw a complete rollercoaster. Living with that constant fear and so many depression was certainly at the start a really difficult thing to deal with. And guilt and shame, not just for my family, but I guess, guilt when Amanda and I were separated, as well, and when Amanda was being tortured and possibly sexually assaulted. And I had no way of stopping that. So it was. It was a rollercoaster ride every single day.__EOS__ Whatever happened to Amanda?__EOS__ Amanda's in Canada. Unfortunately, we don't have a close relationship at the moment. And that's quite a common thing with people that are held in a shared hostage situation. They say because that person reminds you of the trauma. But, yeah - look, hopefully, somewhere down the track, that can be rectified, and we can sort of reconnect.__EOS__ Nigel Brennan is a photojournalist who in 2008 was taken captive in Somalia and held for more than a year. His story appears on the National Geographic series ""Locked Up Abroad"" tomorrow night. Nigel, thanks so much for sharing your story with us.",3

51905," You know, it would be irresponsible for me to speculate on this particular case, or on the generalities of the space program from it. But I do think it is a crucible in a way, training for a space shuttle mission. It's a very intense, very bonding experience. __EOS__ Must be hard to pick up life in a mundane marriage after that. __EOS__ I think it would be very difficult. I mean, of course there are many, many wonderful marriages that astronauts and other people in the space program have. But you know, astronauts are completely human. And there are fractured, fraying marriages, you know, family relationships that are not working out because of, you know, the incredible demands upon these people. __EOS__ The psychological evaluation that NASA does of astronauts before they're selected to the program, are those psychological tests they give intended to appraise their suitability for flight but maybe not for everyday life?

51908,"  That's interesting.  I wonder, Daniel, could you also chart how      much money you spent on the gift as the transition happened from      prospective lover to friend? __EOS__  We were pretty ... at the time, so I didn't      spend a whole lot of money on her then.  And I probably spent about the      same amount this time. __EOS__  All right.  Well, there's an honest answer for you, Daniel.      Thanks very much. __EOS__  Thank you. ",0
51909," And were the slaves also brought along on the Trail of Tears?__EOS__ Yes, they sure were. And that's gotten bollixed up in this current controversy of Cherokee elections that recently concluded after a lot of controversy, recent Cherokee Chief Chad Smith, no relation, took the position that - like a number of Cherokee people, that descendents of the Freedmen were - are not true members of the tribe and therefore were being disenrolled. And this caused a great furor and is still kind of unresolved in the Cherokee nation 'cause Chad Smith did not get reelected.__EOS__ Let's take another call from - Jessica joins us now from San Antonio. Thanks for calling TALK OF THE NATION.__EOS__ Hi.",0
51910," There you are. Because you can describe all this quite well and have gotten it on film, some people hear that explanation, that ability to conceptualize what's happening and assume - like, perhaps like your late father - that therefore, it must be easy to get over and be done with.__EOS__ No, no. The conceptualizing came, actually, from therapy because I learned how to talk about my experience. So I'm very grateful for that. Just because you can talk about something - I mean, to me, talking is just basically intellectual process, and I feel that I really want to get more in touch with my emotions and my emotional process. And that's where I think the healing will take place for me, you know? I mean, everything's - I'm going with the flow right now, and just taking it one day at a time.__EOS__ Going with the flow sounds like quite a far cry from where you were in 1987.__EOS__ Yes. There was no flow at all. There - the - I always called myself a clogged drain, you know? I was just - the dam was there, and the water wasn't flowing. And now, it's moving.",1

Usually for bloody scenes Jerry attaches plastic tubing to the actor's back, and with a syringe fires fake blood through the tubing onto the screen, but not on this budget.__EOS__ They don't have time for the two-hour makeup for me to pull the actor, glue the appliance on, and then squirt the blood, and so we fake it out.__EOS__ Viewers will see the actor after the throat's been slit.

51912," The three groups that were working most closely with right now are some of our veterans. We have a veteran who is now our first intern, Ashley Crandall, and she is a wonderful person. She is suffering from mild traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic stress disorder but she is wonderfully functional with her support dog from Puppies Behind Bars, and she is there to help us work with other veterans, as well, because working with these dogs has healing effect and it gives them the resources to look at jobs and careers in the dog world - whether that be dog training, dog grooming.

51913," Yeah, he died, and it's like one of the most traumatic experiences in my life, and that was one of them when he passed away. And just before he died he said to me  Anna, you should only write about things that are relevant to you. Nothing else. And when he passed away, that's what I felt. I felt that I need to write about this situation that I'm in right now and what I see and what I hear.__EOS__ And what do you think we hear in your music because of it?__EOS__ It's a lot of maybe criticism to where we are now, but also an encouragement, I hope, that one say we'll maybe find the right path towards like a bright future or something.

51914,"  Yeah, very interesting and to know the fact that my children are vegans. My children have never had any dairy or any animal ever since they were born.  They're 10, 9, and 6.  ..TEXT  MARTIN   Why is that? __EOS__  Well, you know, my wife wanted to bring them up that way.  She never really had been a meat-eater, and she's been a vegetarian for many, many years.  And, you know, so much hormones and so many additives are added in the food today, which makes a lot of young kids hyperactive and overweight. And my kids, they love, you know, they eat tofu and, you know, sushi and everything that I cook.  I just make it vegan style, and they're very smart, very attentive, and I don't have that hypertension with these children I have... __EOS__  Well, could you hold it out - as a hamburger - out as an extra incentive or something... __EOS__  Oh, no, no.  They have the vegan veggie patties.   ",0
51915," Mm-hmm.__EOS__ ...we were doing some drugs too. I don't think I ever really got addicted to any of that other stuff and I was able to quit doing that long before I was able to quit drinking. But...__EOS__ Were you doing risky things while you were drinking and doing other drugs?__EOS__ Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I had a motorcycle for a while. That's the one that really scared my dad. He thought that was going to kill me for sure and it probably, you know, it's strange that it didn't now looking back on it. But it, you know, my mom has always been very supportive, both of them have, you know, but there was a moment for Dad I think where he realized that it was going to work out as a career and he called me, he pulled over on the side of the road in his truck and called me. This had been probably eight or nine years ago. And he was listening to like demos from my first solo record, I think and he pulled over on the side of the road on his way to work and called me and said, well, son, you know, I don't think you're going to need a backup plan. I think this - I think you can go ahead and do this. I just wanted to tell you that. Which is a big deal for my father because it was always, have something to fall back on, always.",2
51916," We've heard from scores, countless numbers of lesbian, gay, bi, trans teenagers who have watched the videos. As parents - Terry and I have a teenager of our own - some of the most heartbreaking emails have come from parents who knew their kids were being bullied because they were perceived to be gay, whose kids hadn't come out to them yet, who didn't know what to do, and they were able to sit down at the computer with their kids and watch these videos, and their kids took that opportunity to come out to their parents as their parents were demonstrating to them their support. __EOS__ So you were both bullied to some extent when you were teenagers. Can we hear a little bit of your stories? Terry, do you want to start? __EOS__ Yeah, I had a really hard time of it. I grew up in Spokane, Washington, which me and my friends used to joke was a great place to leave. __EOS__ A good place to be from, far from. ",0
51917,"  Pretty much. __EOS__  No, I was asking Lindsay whether it was her experience or not. __EOS__  Oh no. __EOS__  It's--really wasn't my experience.  I think I had overall      astoundingly positive experience at the agency.  I did well in my      training and had a very successful first tour, but I know what the caller      is speaking about.  During our training, there was always the fear that      you could get cut from the program at any minute, and we did have some      trainees who were basically escorted to the gate and told, you know,      `You're out of a job.  You can't tell anyone where you've been for the      past couple of years, and see you.'  So that does happen.  And, you know,      on some level I guess the agency has the right and the ability to do      that, and if they think someone is not cutting the mustard, so to speak,      in becoming a successful spy, but we found the people cut from our class      who were cut at the last minute, some of us were really shocked.  We had      no idea why these people were cut from the program. ",0
51918," Thats great you noticed that. The other thing we did is he pulls his pants up, like he grabs right above the knee and kind of hikes up his pants. I have no idea why older people do that, but you notice that a lot, you know, I guess so it doesnt get hooked on your heel or something. __EOS__ And so we were playing for these guys and secretly kind of taking little notes for ourselves. __EOS__ Oh, thats really funny. What do you play, what kind of music? __EOS__ It was sort of like Tin Pan Alley-type stuff. ",1

It's a song about men who fought in World War II and survived. Do you want to say a few words about the song before we hear it?__EOS__ I get very moved when it's Armistice Day in England, which is November, or Veterans Day in America, or any time you see someone who's fought in a war marching to remember the ones that have fallen. Bernie wrote this song about his father, who didn't die in the war. My mother fought in the war; my dad didn't, but my mum did, in the Second World War.__EOS__ So this is Elton John from his new album ""The Diving Board."" This is ""Oceans Away.""__EOS__  I hung out with the old folks, in the hope that I'd get wise. I was trying to bridge the gap, between the great divide. Hung on every recollection, in the theater of their eyes picking up on this and that, in the few that still survive.

51921," A.E. Peoria is a kind of salty war correspondent. You know, he's in Africa covering genocide. He's trying to do these really important stories, but unfortunately, the kind of stories that are hard to get into publication because it might not be a trend story or the sexy story of the day involving a Kim Kardashian-type. And so he is just overseas, working incredibly hard, goes to Iraq, covers the war. And then, you know, the book charts his disillusionment, you know, with the constraints of the magazine.__EOS__ And Michael is trying to help him. He's the ambitious intern who looks at Peoria as somewhat of a role model but a questionable one.__EOS__ Definitely. I think that as a young intern, Michael sees what a difficult world it is to navigate if you actually do want to go against the entrenched establishment at the magazine.__EOS__ There are several of these kind of asides in the book where Michael steps out of the story and directly addresses the reader in his own voice. And there's an interesting one on page 82 where he issues a flat-out apology to his colleagues because while he never says so directly, the story is about his time at Newsweek, even though the book is just called ""The Last Magazine."" Would you mind reading a little bit of that interlude?",0
51922," Yes, that's a right royal row they've just had over there. Yes, people use it in an intensifying way. Isn't that fascinating, though, Neal, the unpredictability of that? I mean, who would have predicted, you know, a couple of hundred years ago, that a respectable word like royal would end up being used as a kind of everyday intensified by people from, well, on my side of the pond, you know, Lancashire and Yorkshire and so on. I don't know how far it's used on your side, but...__EOS__ Somewhat. Let's get Jen on the line, Jen with us from San Francisco.__EOS__ Hi, hi. It's a great topic.__EOS__ Thank you.",0
51923," Yeah, yeah, you can certainly throw it into your mid-40s, and a lot of knuckleballers, their best years come from ages 38 to 44, right in that area. Charlie Hough, Phil Niekro, Tim Wakefield all won a great number of games during that age period.__EOS__ You grew up in Nashville, you tell us in this book, and your dad left your mom early, and your mom had a drinking problem, used to take you to a bar called Joe's Village Inn. And, you know, it's gotten a lot of attention in the book that you revealed that you were abused sexually in your childhood, you know, once - well, repeatedly by a teenage girl who was your babysitter when you were eight years old and then on another occasion more brutally by I guess a 17-year-old boy. This is tough stuff. Did you tell anybody about these incidents at the time?__EOS__ No, I didn't. In fact, it wasn't for 23 years until I uttered a word of it to anybody. I think one of the tough things about being sexually abused is you - you know, right away you feel like you've been a part of something incredibly wicked, that you've had something to do with it even. I now know it has nothing to do with any fault of your own. But you certainly feel like it was partially your fault. And so, I always just stuffed it away and would build up mechanisms for dealing with that pain.__EOS__ Yet you became a great athlete. I mean, you were a great athlete, and you played, you know, sports, many of them, well in junior high and high school. Did you think much about the abuse at the time, or had you repressed it or thought you'd repressed it?",0
51924," Thank you, Melissa.__EOS__ Great to be here.__EOS__ Sean Wilentz, talk a bit about the songwriter of ""Marching Through Georgia"" because he also wrote a few other songs in this collection. His name is Henry Clay Work.__EOS__ Yes. Henry Clay Work was part of a - I don't know, a sort of diffuse Tin Pan Alley that produced a lot of the songs that we think of as, you know, iconic Civil War songs. We think of them kind of drifting up out of the campfires in the trenches of the war itself but they were composed by commercial songwriters, much as we have commercial songwriters today.",2
51925," In my hometown, in Piedras Negras in Mexico, I ran into a Methodist missionary who said that if I really wanted to be a good auto mechanic I would have to learn English. So she agreed to teach me English if I would help her with chores. And so I began to learn a little bit of English and then one thing led to another and then she said, you know, if you really want to be a good auto mechanic you ought to go study in the U.S. And then she was able to help me attend high school by crossing the border. And then when I finished high school, she continued that and she said, you know what, you really should try this one-year university then you'll know for sure if you want to be an auto mechanic. And I look back and I realize now that she was really a very smart woman, she really knew what she was doing and how these things would end up.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, we are speaking with Hector Ruiz. He's the former CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD. And now I want to talk about the story - which is one of the other stories at the center of your memoir. It's called ""Slingshot."" This is this giant antitrust lawsuit between AMD and Intel. People thought that when you pushed to file this case within the company and outside of the company, that you were crazy. Not to put too fine a point on it, that they thought you had lost your mind. Why were you so convinced that this was the right course of action?__EOS__ We had come up with a way to make the existing computer significantly more powerful, better performance, lower cost, and all those things. And when I saw the potential of that technology was significantly better than what our competitor had or anyone had, and we were still unable to get the share of business, it became clear to me that we had to do something besides just creating a great product. And that something had to do to find a way to stop what I believe was abusive business practices on the part of our competitor. And after researching this in many different ways that we thought we should go about doing that, the last thing we really wanted to do is file a suit. But after we exhausted every possible way to accomplish it, we ended up concluding that we had to do that or we would never be able to get out of the pressure and the unreasonable practices that were keeping AMD from being more successful.__EOS__ It was a very long road. I mean I think that anybody would agree. But you eventually - the company eventually did prevail. There was a settlement. There was a settlement of more than $1 billion, right? There was not an admission of wrongdoing - if I'm right about that - but there was a settlement of more than $1 billion paid from Intel to AMD. And also, subsequently, federal regulators at the FTC did set certain conditions on Intel's conduct, saying that they could not engage in these practices again. Do you feel vindicated?",3
51926," That addresses exactly that same point of that slower warming. What this scientist was saying was we know that there are other factors besides human greenhouse gases that affect the climate and affect the temperature, and this slowing that we've seen is clearly due to some sort of natural phenomenon, but we don't know what it is, and we really need to understand that as well as we understand human contributions.__EOS__ And in general, though, when those emails are examined more carefully by folks who understand them, what, if anything, do they tell us?__EOS__ What they tell us is that the scientists who were sending the emails are human beings who are dismissive of people they disagree with and think that - you know, they don't mind calling I guess a fool a fool, if that's how they feel, in private, in what they consider to be private conversations.__EOS__ But they don't show the scientists saying to one another ah, this is a fraud, I don't really believe this, we're putting one over on people?",0
51927," I don't have to worry - I don't think about dyeing my hair. That's not going to happen. I just am who I am. And for women, there's so many more pressures. And it's - I just feel lucky to be the gender that I am.__EOS__ Just one more thing I just want to say  Because you come off as so, like, totally poised on TV and so totally together, both visually and, you know, emotionally, I really appreciate that you're willing to talk about the times in your life when you didn't feel together and how you kind of came out, you know, the other end of that. I think it's really important to hear. So thank you.__EOS__ Well, thank you for letting me talk about it. May I add one thing on that topic, though?__EOS__ Please.",3
51928," I did enjoy the sales, I'll tell you that.__EOS__ Oh, that, I'm sure. And maybe Ron Paul will get the Clarkson bump.__EOS__ I know. I know. I was like, hell, I'm going to start endorsing everybody.__EOS__ I was like I'm just going to start saying names about stuff to get people to buy my album.",2
51929," But fortunately, I must say it's - the reaction has been unbelievably gratifying. People have felt - have seemed to be almost humblingly grateful that this movie is out and they feel like it is an accurate representation, not of the entire community because that's, you know, not possible. But that it's an accurate representation of someone with Asperger's, of a unique human being with Asperger's, and also a positive representation. So, that's been incredibly gratifying and also a little bit - you know, sometimes I feel a little bit like a fraud because as I said that's not why I made the movie. __EOS__ So, when you had the screenings and people with Asperger's rose and said things, what kind of things did you hear? __EOS__ Well, there was one young woman who basically started a list of things that she liked about the movie, starting with the crane shot that started on the leaf and pulled focus to the van. So, she was being, you know, very precise and then, you know, went on with a list of maybe 10 or 12 more things that she really liked, both sort of large and small. __EOS__ And that was kind of impressive. Then, there are - the most sort of touching thing about those Q & A's I think have to do with parents of children who have Asperger's because I think the movie touches both on their fears and their hopes for their children's future and their concern for sort of what happens when they're left on their own. ",1
51930," Yes. __EOS__ ...the son has just walked into the house. __EOS__  I ran all the way home from school. I can't wait to hear what today's project was going to be. __EOS__  Actually kids, starting today, your father and I are going to be teaching the arts to students at PS-146. So, you two are going be on your own for a few hours every day after school. ",1
51931," Well, one of the problems or at least one of the things that I've seen in Yemen is that there's a real difference between strikes that the U.S. carries out, strikes against what are often called high-value targets. So if you'll remember, this is really the second incarnation of al-Qaida in Yemen. The first, the back was really broken in November 2002 when the U.S. carried out a drone strike that killed the then-head of al-Qaida in Yemen, a man named Abu Ali al-Harithi.__EOS__ That's the way that the United States counts or doesn't count casualties in Yemen, if you're a young man or a man of military age, and you're killed in a strike, you don't count as a civilian?__EOS__ Yeah, this is what we know from a great New York Times piece by Scott Shane and Jo Becker that talked about that. And in fact I think this is a real problem in Yemen, because one of the difficulties and one of the things that I've noticed over the past nearly a decade that I've been traveling to Yemen, is just because someone sounds like al-Qaida and just because someone looks like al-Qaida, doesn't necessarily mean that they are al-Qaida.__EOS__ Gregory Johnsen will be back in the second half of the show. His new book is called ""The Last Refuge  Yemen, al-Qaeda and America's War in Arabia."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.",0
51932," That's right. That's right. It was a religious ceremony, actually, but that's correct.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ There was no state involvement. I mean, Georgia is obviously a very conservative state, and Michael Bowers is the attorney general who was the Bowers in Bowers versus Hardwick. So I was certainly aware of his opposition to sodomy. Interestingly, you know, sodomy is no longer permitted in this country. Part of the argument of sodomy is that it was being used to harm gay men and lesbians.__EOS__ What are they going to be doing sexually? So in that situation, his assumption of sodomy was used against me and as a justification for firing me.",3
51933," I'll tell you what it is about them. There is something -talking about the title ""Plenty"" - there is something very plentiful about them. They are really symbols of abundance because there are so much of them in every pomegranate. And they obviously have beautiful color and they have this sort of sharpness that is a little bit sweet. So, they can add them in so many contexts and they always sort of added a little extra something, which is hard to explain. But it's very visual. It's completely beautiful. __EOS__ And then that green bean salad that my friend served to us. Those ingredients are pretty simple but they tasted fresh as a minute. There were green beans and snow peas and green peas. And then you start with your seeds again, Mr. Ottolenghi. __EOS__ You do the mustard seeds and coriander seeds. __EOS__ Yeah, absolutely. And you know what it is; basically, all these are very simple ingredients that everybody knows but I think sometimes they don't know how to put them together properly. There is a long tradition of overcooking green beans of all sorts. You know, even in Italian cooking, which does wonders with vegetables. ",0
51934," I was the L man. L is the letter that I love the most. __EOS__ In Boito's ""Mefistofele,"" I play Mefistofele - who is the devil, basically. __EOS__ Or a messenger of the devil, and my son seems to like those things the best. I'm in a red costume, and my hair is red, and when he sees that, he calls me Red Daddy. __EOS__ For some reason, composers seem to feel that the bass voice is very much suited to evil or villainous parts. And I certainly had a lot of time over my career playing bad guys. ",2
51935," ...Douglas' father, right - is chasing their General Aguinaldo up north. __EOS__ There is, obviously, a larger story, not only to the war in the north, but a larger story to the Philippine conflict. Much of the war was also fought in the southern part of the Philippines, and it was a war of United States forces against Muslim troops. And that forms a pretty interesting analogy, too. __EOS__ Yeah. It's interesting, some of the parallels, which were not why I made the movie, but are unavoidable. Teddy Roosevelt, when he became president and General Aguinaldo was captured, declared mission accomplished and said the war was over. But it kept going for at least up till World War I and probably further than that, but moving southward into Mindanao, into the Moro lands. And so we were fighting against Muslims in that area, usually through the Philippine Constabulary but also American troops were involved. __EOS__ And we see the Philippine jungle. And those of us who are old enough, it just leaps to our mind, Vietnam.  ",1
51936," Christine, have you seen the movie? Christine?__EOS__ I haven't. But based on the conversation, I mean, explaining science on a bar - I mean, Ira, you - I enjoy your show, but you got so excited about equating sex and women in science. It's just so disappointing and disgusting. It really is.__EOS__ Well, OK.__EOS__ Christine, you need to see the movie, because I don't think you'll be disappointed. I think what you'll see is it's the first time a full picture of a real woman is presented, because her brain is absolutely there, and she's an emotional, breathing, real person, and I think you'll actually be very happy when you see it. Check out the trailer at losingcontrolmovie.com. It'll give you a really good taste for it.",1
51937," And on a just sort of a impulse. __EOS__ Well you did good. Let's hear your first scene in ""Almost Famous."" You're walking in the door. You're still living with your mother. You're 18. Your mother's played by Frances McDormand. As you walk in, you're wearing this like big coat and you're kind of holding it shut as if you're covering something up. So you walk in, your mother greets you at the door, and your little brother... xxx __EOS__  You've been kissing! __EOS__  No, I haven't. ",2
51938," But here's the thing I don't get, right? I mean, the history of jazz is about rebels, about people who are experimenting in ways that were pushing the boundaries. Miles Davis was doing things that were so radical, and yet today - I mean, the mainstream jazz community still finds it odd to hear hip-hop and jazz together.__EOS__ We kind of killed the alive to praise the dead. And I don't think that the jazz community embraces newer artist anymore. We get mad that new audiences don't want to come watch us play, you know? But it's like, you know, we keep sending our grandfather out to the playground.__EOS__ In other words, you keep playing - I mean, you're asked to play standards when...__EOS__ Yeah, that kind of vibe and that kind of mindset, you know what I mean? Everybody else is sending their kids out to the playground. Let's send new sound, new vibrant life out into the world, and we keep sending our grandfather out and wondering why nobody wants to play with us. We have to embrace our new sound because that's what it's always been doing, you know? That's why jazz kept changing. It always changed, you know what I mean? It's supposed to change.",2
51939," Oh sure.__EOS__ Oh actually, just, I have to tell you something funny.__EOS__ Sure.__EOS__ Because, you know, we serve about 500 pounds of meat every day, we have this huge flock of raven who live on the preserve.",1
51940," My guest is Stephen King. His new novel is called ""Joyland."" More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ My guest is Stephen King. His new novel is called ""Joyland."" So you mentioned the boy in the wheelchair was the first image that came to you, and that boy in the novel is a 10-year-old named Mike who has muscular dystrophy, but a special kind which usually kills you in your early teens or 20s.__EOS__ He has a power to see a little bit beyond this world, and he has a very small talent compared to some of the other characters in books that I've written. He's got a little bit of precognition.__EOS__ And his grandfather in the novel is a famous preacher, third to Oral Roberts - and who's the second one you mentioned? Jimmy Swaggart.",0
51941," There's an interesting scene between the two of them where Kim Fowley has essentially bullied Cherie into posing for some sex kitten photographs in a Japanese magazine. The rest of the band didn't know about it, and when Joan Jett found out, she just throws a fit. Joan Jett is, I should say, played by the vampire girl Kristen Stewart. And she chastises Cherie, Dakota Fanning. __EOS__  What is this? You think anybody's going to take us seriously? __EOS__ . __EOS__ What were you thinking? Publicize the music not your crotch. ",1
51942," Well, it - whenever I get a set of lyrics, I go into a studio, Terry, with nothing planned. I get a set of lyrics when I go into the studio, and I look at them, and T-Bone and I said, well, that looks like an interesting song with the title. And it - yeah, we recorded and wrote this one first on the album because it's such a great and interesting story about someone who was betrayed by his lover and, you know, became infamous because of this. And it was a no-brainer to write this one first.__EOS__ The opening piano line in this is very, I'd say catchy, but it's a very sober line. Is that - did that come first for you?__EOS__ Yes, the intros - every song on the album has a piano intro. In fact, when you played ""Oceans Away,"" that's the first time I'd ever recorded in my whole life a piano and vocal just on its own, which sounds astonishing, seeing as I'm a piano player and a singer. And ""Oscar Wilde"" is the second track, and it has that intro. It goes .__EOS__ OK, great, so let's hear ""Oscar Wilde Gets Out,"" and this is from Elton John's new album, ""The Diving Board.""",3
51943," Well - well thank you, Clayton. The boat chases were great fun to do up to the time that I smashed my teeth and my knee. But I have a lot of louse and particularly, I have some very good friends in David Hedison who played Felix Leiter and Clifton James who - there were some great characters around in that film. __EOS__ That's great. I understand that you - in the love scenes of course, there were many of them. The love scenes with Jane Seymour who played Solitaire in the movie. You both had your socks on back there? __EOS__ Well, when you've been filming in Jamaica in sort of a 120 degrees of no shade, and you come back to a cold English stage in the middle of the winter and the doors are being opened on the stage and then you have to climb in the cold bed, no electric blankets, no hot water bottle, just the two of you freezing to death underneath the sheet. Trying to look cool, you need something on your feet to keep them warm. __EOS__ Somehow, I can't - I don't understand the glamor of James Bond with the socks on in bed. But let's go to David in Saint Louis, Missouri. Hi, David. ",0
51944," The narrators concentrate on their jobs seemingly oblivious to the details of politics until the coup when they're taken into custody with the president at one of his palaces. They begin to fall back into their familiar roles, but this time serving the rebel leader known as The Commander. __EOS__ As someone who had grown up in apartheid South Africa who'd always - and as a white, I'd always been interested in, you know, how people are complicit in these regimes even if they are opposed to them, and my parents were but we were still beneficiaries of that system. And so, for a while I think I was trying to work through my own accountability for what had happened. __EOS__ When apartheid ended and the country was trying to remake itself, empowerment projects were set up as a way to help give opportunities to black South Africans. Ceridwen Dovey made a documentary film about one such project while she was studying anthropology and film at Harvard as an undergraduate. The film looked at labor relations on a post-apartheid wine farm. __EOS__ They were claiming that workers were being given a percentage of the profits or part of the land grow their grapes on. They're building houses, owning their own houses for the first time. So I want to see these claims were real or not, so that's when I went often - looked on the wine farm and kind of track apartheid.

51945,"  Yes, yes, that's what we need. We need a distributor. Now, do you know anyone like that?__EOS__  Yeah, I mean, I used to until you killed him.__EOS__ Thank you so much.__EOS__ And I love the way your former chemistry teacher, who's now your partner cooking meth, is lecturing you about your lack of motivation, the way only a teacher could.",3
51946," Exactly.__EOS__ What was it like to see this young woman inhabit this character and this story that you were so invested in?__EOS__ Ah, it was really nice. Really nice to see the script come to life and I enjoyed working with the kids, with Abdullah as well. And he speaks English. She doesn't, he translates for her. And she teaches him how to be street savvy.__EOS__ Haifaa Al-Monsour, she directed the new film, ""Wadjda.""",1
51947," I don't think the current crisis is an argument against big banks or an argument for small banks. Small banks and big banks can all make the same kinds of mistakes, but it's not a function of their size, but really how they're managed. __EOS__ And now, we'll turn to a banker in a really small town. Kris Ausborn is president of Iowa Trust and Savings Bank in Emmetsburg, Iowa - a rural town  than 4,000 people. __EOS__ Thank you, Jacki. __EOS__ Tell us about Iowa Trust and Savings. How big are you? And what kind of loans do you handle? ",3
51948," Pictures at an Exhibition,"" by the Russian National Orchestra. Carlo Ponti Jr. joins us now from the studios of NPR West. Thanks so much for being with us. __EOS__ Thank you, Mr. Simon. It's a pleasure to be on your show. __EOS__ I don't know how you became a musician, and let's note for our audience, of course, your father was perhaps the most famous world film producer of his time, Carlo Ponti and your mother, still the most beautiful woman in the world, I'd say. __EOS__ Sophia Loren. How did you find your way to music? ",2
51949," Ever since the Romans had occupied this part of the world, providing water to people was what government did. It was the essence of surviving in the desert. Saddam had built a number of water plants, oftentimes with Soviet or other people's money, and these water plants had pumped along without much success from the 1960s on up. Some of them were older than I was. __EOS__ So what happened? __EOS__ Nothing. Nothing happened. The problem is, is that you can't, with all the best intentions in the world, simply rebuild a water network. Our plant was one plant, was one plant in a long line of facilities that were necessary to take water out of the Tigris, process it, bring it all the way into Baghdad, then take the dirty water out, bring it all the way back, process it and bring it back in, put it back into the river. __EOS__ It sounds like this was a case where there was a big, important problem like sewage treatment and water purification, but that you didn't have nearly the kind of resources that you would need to do something on that scale. People needed to think bigger? ",0
51950,"  Enoch? You couldn't possibly be so cruel.__EOS__ It's a tricky relationship to sort of nail down, really. I think it's not a great romantic love that they've got but they've definitely, you know, they bring something to each other's lives, and it's like a gentleman's agreement almost. That doesn't sound very romantic at all. But, you know, they're good for each other and, you know, they respect each other and enjoy each other's company. Well, that's certainly what it was like in the first season.__EOS__ But that's the amazing thing about it, you know, it changes all the time so you kind of, it keeps you on your toes. The characters are constantly evolving, you know, the way that we do in real life, so you can't be sort of tied down to your idea of the character because I'm always surprised by things Margaret comes out with.__EOS__ I wanted to hear another clip. And this is from late in the second season when your relationship has evolved quite a bit and Nucky Thompson - again, this corrupt Atlantic City politician, who your character, Mrs. Schroeder, has moved in with, is in trouble. His political and mob allies have turned on him. He's under investigation for many crimes - including murder - and your character's daughter has contracted polio. And your character, Margaret Schroeder, is at heart a religious person and believes that God is punishing her for the evil in her life. And she's been subpoenaed, perhaps to testify against Nucky Thompson in his case. And you and Steve Buscemi, the Nucky character, are talking about that. Let's listen.",3
51951," The way that our imagination can go anywhere. If they dream of a dinosaur, the dinosaur appears in page without you having to realize it. And what people don't realize the kind of joy and thrill there is in actually building a perfect picture of something you have in your mind, even though it takes time and it's expensive. Yet, it still is very pleasurable and it still is part of the same process. You know, and the process is creating a piece of art or telling a story. I mean, I have to say being a novelist is the loneliest life in the world. You know, when you're making a film, you're surrounded by people and the flow of ideas kind of is always a communal thing, you know, so you don't feel alone. Writing a novel you can feel really alone.__EOS__ When they came to you and said they wanted to reprint this novel, may I ask, did you pick it up after more than 30 years and read it again all over?__EOS__ I've begun to, yeah. I've begun to. It's just thought I could have had an entirely different career.__EOS__ Without getting specific, did you begin to reread your novel and ever come across a line and say to yourself, boy, I wish I had a chance to redo it?",0
51952," It's funny now, odd to hear. It's the first time I think I've ever heard the voice without the picture. And I worked with an opera singer. I lowered my voice almost an octave for the role.__EOS__ And the accent, is that Transylvanian that you're...__EOS__ It is - you know what? It is Transylvanian. We found a girl who ended up actually being one of the brides of - in the movie. She was from Transylvania.__EOS__ And so you listened to her speak, and you picked up the accent and the rhythm?",1
51953," Yeah, you give me too much credit. __EOS__ Well, you will be pleased to know that Dean Olsher is on a campaign a crusade maybe, you could say, to get more Americans hooked on the cryptic puzzle which you love so much. __EOS__ From the Times and they can looked at cruise like this one today  regularly indulge in, not working, four letters? __EOS__ Idle, lazy. ",0
51954,"  Yeah because you let him off the hook, as was pointed out by everyone with Internet access. You blew that interview, and you took it out on me.__EOS__  It was two days after the thing with the student. I thought it would be a good idea to show deference to a three-star...__EOS__  Well, you took it out on me, you did it in front of the staff, then you took it out on the staff the way you're doing right now.__EOS__  The staff isn't here. You're taking the department heads. Who the hell knows who they're taking?",3
51955, In the 1940s during World War II. And then your father dies when you are seven.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ So your mother is on her own...__EOS__ Yeah.,3
51956," Yeah, yeah. So it's large and it's in the book to just alert you of, you know, cool things you can do with the space program, like, save the Earth.__EOS__ How - could we blow it up out of the sky, or what can we do about it when it...__EOS__ We've got generals out there, of course, who know that we still have bombs in the silos and you can imagine them in the war rooms. Let's blow this sucker out of the sky, you know, with chewing tobacco.__EOS__ They get juiced by this stuff.",0
51957," Why don't you think teachers insist on keeping up with cursive education after the third grade, if handwriting, indeed, is so important? __EOS__ Well, I think there are a lot of reasons. One is that they really don't have much time in schools anymore. You know, they're so busy preparing children for tests and is there no - as far as I know - there's no standardized handwriting test that those kids have to pass. So, that's one problem. They really do have a time crunch in school. __EOS__ But what about, I mean, adults who may have had that teaching in grammar school? Why has good handwriting among adults declined? __EOS__ We live in the digital age. My own handwriting is a case in point. I am obsessed with my own handwriting. It's probably not putting it too strongly. I've always been interested in it. I've always tried to write legibly and, if possible, beautifully, and I've always tried to have my handwriting kind of express who I am. ",0
51958," You're not doing this again, are you? __EOS__ Oh, we're just walking. __EOS__ I hope not, because next time, I'm writing you all up, okay? __EOS__ Okay. We can't - okay. That's fine. We're just trying to get over to the mall. ",0
51959," Well, this is a song called ""Bully,"" I think, right?__EOS__ Yep.__EOS__ Are we hearing that organic feel here?__EOS__ Yeah. I mean, it's like a double bass sound. That's me on the drums. It's my brother scratching with a deck. It's brass. You know, it's the reggae sound as well. So it's very, very organic.",2
51960," Yeah, pretty much self-taught but heavily influenced. __EOS__ And didn't they, they're older brothers, tell you  Victor, you can't take as big a role as that? __EOS__ Absolutely not, and that's really where I got it from. I got it from my brothers. My oldest brother Reggie plays guitar. He plays this way. It's just, you know, crazy. They're all crazy, all my brothers. __EOS__ Was it true that your brothers lobbied your parents because they needed a bass player? ",0
51961," And I thought that was ""Abies Iris Rose"" and I wanted no part of it. And then several years passed and I happened to be in California and Lenny Bernstein was in California. By that time, juvenile delinquent gangs had come into being. And on the coast it was a great deal, great problems with Chicanos which in New York was Puerto Ricans. That's where the idea came from - the front page. And thats what the  and then Lenny and I called Jerry and said, we're ready to go. __EOS__ Did you have any reservations about singing and dancing gangs? __EOS__ On the stage, no. in the movie, yes. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. ",3
51962," Yeah. You know, and it's true. It's true. If you're not getting happier as you're getting older, you know, something's up. So I feel really good about where I'm at in my life. I feel like I'm growing continuously, even like - I'm having these realizations on a regular basis. I don't know. I'm almost 30. Saturn's returning.__EOS__ Almost 30. That old?__EOS__ I'm rounding up. I don't know why.__EOS__ But things feel good?",3
51963," So you basically accrued this amazing collection of original newspaper clippings from the time, to retrace the Revolutionary War. Where did you find these things, first of all?__EOS__ Yeah. It's not just newspaper clippings; it's the entire newspapers. These newspapers are not like what we think of today. They're quite different in that they are only four pages in length, and only about 10 by 15 inches tall. So what I did is began the - kind of this quest, finding them from people who had found them in attics, or behind walls of old homes; European book dealers. They're available on the open market, much like fine art - or any other type of historical collectible.__EOS__ So give us a sense of what the journalism looked like, at that time.__EOS__ It's completely different. For instance, you open up a newspaper, and the first thing that's going to strike you is that there's no headlines. Back then, they used datelines because they were mostly printing news from other newspapers. So today, we have AP and Reuters. Back then, they had a news exchange system where as soon as a printer finished typesetting his edition of the week, he would then send issues to other printers around Colonial America. So if you found a newspaper, and it was a Philadelphia newspaper, and it said Savannah April 14th; chances are, that came from the Georgia Gazette.",0
51964," It's an extraordinary story of, you know, courage and survival, and your decision to stay, stupidity. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ Stephanie, you must have been worried sick? __EOS__ Oh yeah, we, well, we have a network of folks. I can remember, as a matter of fact, I still have messages saved on the cell phone. One of the persons that I called, I found out that he was in New Orleans in a boat, rescuing folks. ",2
51965," Yeah.__EOS__ Well, he's from Texas and I'm from Oklahoma, so that helped.__EOS__ Because I just know people like, he kind of just sounds like, you know, gym teachers I used to have.__EOS__ But, yeah, I don't know. It's just watching him kind of talk and I don't know, you just kind of - I've - I've figured out that I kind of, it's either, I can kind of get someone immediately or I don't. You know, like it immediately happens or it's never going to happen. You know, it's, it's like it, it rarely like - well, sometimes it improves. I did the guy from, I did Daniel Day-Lewis' character from ""There Will Be Blood,"" and it got better as the week went along. But, yeah, I don't, I don't know, it's hard to describe. I remember asking Darrell Hammond that once. I go how do you prepare and do your impressions? And he just kind of was like, I don't know.",3
51966," I thought you were going to be my therapist. And I explained to her that my practice was very full and that generally what I did was psychopharmacology and that I referred to some trusted colleagues for therapy. __EOS__ Does this type of treatment really make sense? Is this the kind of treatment that we want to be delivering for our patients in the United States? And why has it come to this sort of split model of treatment? __EOS__ Well, let's talk about that. So essentially, you and many, many other psychiatrists really aren't in the business of providing therapy. You are in the business of doing what? __EOS__ We are in the business of making diagnoses using the DSM, which is the official diagnostic manual for the psychiatric disorders of the American Psychiatric Association. ",0
51967," Well, we were all with him. His entire family was with him. He was in his own bed instead of in the hospital, you know, which is an enviable way to die. I think he had what I would describe as a beautiful death with people who had loved him all his life and revered him and respected him. And all of his children. There's something about wanting to connect with your children before you die. I don't know what that is.__EOS__ You've probably...__EOS__ It was just an easier burden.__EOS__ You've probably known a lot of people who've died young, and I'm thinking, just to name a few - Gram Parsons, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison.",2
51968," That didn't suck.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ Quite honestly, you don't spend all this time worrying about the impact. You just hope that it has any.__EOS__ Right. There was no way we could know that this was going to somehow be the thing that it has become. There's just no way.",1
51969,"  Nope. What's the problem, Barry?__EOS__  We need 38 home runs, 120 RBI's and...__EOS__  The problem we're trying to solve is that there are rich teams and there are poor teams, then there's 50 feet of crap, and then there's us. It's an unfair game and now we've been gutted like organ donors for the rich. Boston's taken our kidneys. Yankees's taken our heart and you guys are sitting around talking the same old good body nonsense like we're selling jeans, like we're looking for Fabio.__EOS__  Billy, that's a very touching story and everything, but I think we're all very much aware of what we're facing here. You have a lot of experience and wisdom in this room. Now, you need to have a little bit of faith and let us and let us do the job of replacing Giambi.",1
51970," Yes.__EOS__ You know, when we saw it, we were in our late 30s, had little kids. Now our kids are in college. They're gone. What's going on here? Do you see your films differently as you age?__EOS__ I don't really see them very much, but I do think that that movie has managed to last in an amazing way. You know, kids in college have their websites, and there are questionnaires that I don't know the answers to. What was Harry wearing in the scene in the Metropolitan Museum? I mean, I have no idea the answers to these questions.__EOS__ How do you work friendship between men and women? And, of course, the thing under that thing which is in that scene is the real theme of the movie, which is the difference between men and women, one of my favorite things to do movies about.",1
51971,"  Exactly.  Yes.  But--and it wasn't even the big things.      I've had bad luck anytime I give a guy anything.  I found a $3.75 charge      from a restaurant near an old boyfriend's house from when he had a really      awful cold. So I called the diner up to surprise him and have them      deliver some chicken soup, which turned out to be, like, the kiss of      death for the relationship. He calls me up, I'm thinking the guy's going      to thank me, but he's, like, totally shell-shocked.  Basically, he said      he thought it was too nice, all right?  That's, like, a $3 cup of chicken      soup.  But to me, too nice would've been if I sent over, you know,      chicken soup and Robitussin, you know.  I thought I was playing it cool.      You know, I'll just keep it to just the soup. But I learned no watches      and no chicken soup.  So the next guy I get involved with is going to get      socks. __EOS__  Renee, we hope you'll call us back when you give us the line item      on the anniversary present. __EOS__  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Well, thanks very much.  Fun conversation. __EOS__  Appreciate the phone call. ",0
51972," I realized that I didn't really remember much of what happened during that time in my life from, like, nine to 13. It was completely a blank. And I didn't even remember the moment that I saw her again, which is - I was walking across this playing field at school and I saw her with some random young girl. And I recognized her as my mom, and I went up to her and she didn't even acknowledge me or recognize me. __EOS__ Your father still lives down the street from you? He was very close to you. __EOS__ He lives, yeah, two houses away. __EOS__ Was he a part of this process? ",3
51973,"  Well, you know, I should mention, Leon Huff, early in your career you also did some session work for Phil Spector. __EOS__  Yeah. __EOS__  You played piano with the famous Phil Spector Christmas album. __EOS__  That's right. ",2
51974," No, no, no...__EOS__ You're putting a judgment on it.__EOS__ The characters are sadistic. The characters are sadistic. I'm not talking about, you know, the filmmaker. I'm talking about the characters. I mean, the characters are undeniably sadistic.__EOS__ Mm-hmm. When you say after the tragedy, what do you mean by that exactly?",1
51975," Yeah. It's just thin. You know, when you look at the parts and you look at the door handles and the thing. But it was a $3,990 car. You know, people expected so much more, and that was part of the problem. __EOS__ All right. Well, let's meet the owner of the car. Arnold Campanile is here with me. __EOS__ I'm from outside Philadelphia. __EOS__ So, you drove this car down from outside Philadelphia? ",0
51976," Thank you. __EOS__ When did you hear? And how did you hear that you'd won the prestigious Newbery medal? __EOS__ I heard Monday morning at about 7 23. My kids were eating breakfast, getting ready to go to school, and the phone rang. __EOS__ And who was calling? ",0
51977,"  And it means? __EOS__  You know, you see heads of state and things like that in      centuries bygone riding around in those boxes where there's two people on      either side sort of carrying him along.  I don't know how to describe it.      They're like a canopied box in which a member of the monarchy would      ride.  The one in the ""The Infanta"" is perched on top of an elephant. __EOS__   And as she sits upon on her place, her      innocence laid on her face, from all atop the parapets glow a multitude      of coronets, melodies rhapsodical and fair.  And all our hearts afire,      the sky ablaze with cannon fire, we all raise our voices to the air, to      the air. __EOS__  It's great because at the end of this huge spectacle with      parapets and coronets, where it all ends up is inside the mind of that      little girl and what she's thinking.

William McGee, welcome to FRESH AIR. Good to have you. You know, a lot of our younger listeners don't remember the earlier days of aviation, when people really looked forward to flying and sometimes dressed up for it. And you say in this book you have always been in love with flying. Give us a sense of your history with aviation.__EOS__ Sure, thanks very much for having me on. One of the things I point out in the book is the first time I went to an airport, when I was five years old, and I was dressed in a suit and tie and a white shirt and black shoes, and I wasn't even flying. I was there to pick up my brother, who was home on leave from the Army.__EOS__ Right, I have to ask you, you say piano bars and steak? You're referring to the terminals?",0
51980," It's a great pleasure. Thank you.__EOS__ And are there more differences between these two cases or more similarities?__EOS__ Well, there are a lot of similarities. But the main thing, I think, to say is that although Nuremberg was, I think, a success, it was sometimes denounced as victor's justice. I think it was not that. It was a success and it dealt, as Roosevelt and Truman wanted to do, in a judicial and proper manner with the appalling criminals of the Nazi regime who survived the end of the war and were captured.__EOS__ Yet you pointed out that one of the key elements of a trial is that should a defendant be found not guilty, he gets to go free.",0
51981," Hey, Robert. __EOS__ First, tell us about what happened during that pre-season game in Dallas. __EOS__ Well, it was the first game in the Cowboys' new, over-the-top stadium. They've got a wine bar, art installations and the world's biggest HDTV, which stretches from one 20-yard line to the other, and it's suspended 30 yards above the playing field. The thing cost $40 million. __EOS__ But apart from whether it was deliberate or not, 30 yards, 90 feet in the air, is that a height that only an NFL punter could reach? Could a high school kicker - when you were being a place-kicker for your book - could you have kicked the ball 90 feet high? ",3

So I was expecting the usual, let's say, lively discussion. __EOS__ Yeah, okay. __EOS__ And in fact  well, I'm just really taken aback with how appreciative people are. There's a kind of feeling of gratitude that comes from the comments that I really didn't anticipate. __EOS__ I think that there's a certain willingness of people to complain and say what's wrong, but the fact that you're getting positive comments is really telling, because I think, I think what you've accomplished is you've sort of brought people into a world that they normally are excluded from, and you've done it in a way that doesn't scare them, and I think that's really something to be proud of.

51984," We both grew up in Portland. __EOS__ Yes. So we've known each other for years. And in June the band came to Washington D.C. for a show, and I threw a dinner party for them and a bunch of D.C. friends and some other Portland folks. The party turned into somehow a singalong in the upstairs of my house around the piano. And the next day sitting at my desk at NPR, Thomas calls me and he says will you do a song on the next album? __EOS__ Typical Pink Martini. __EOS__ Is it really? ",2
51985," You were 19 years old, living in Seattle. And talking to you on the phone, you were really out of it and said some frightening things. So we jumped on a plane, flew across the country. You were paranoid. You had lost a lot of weight. It was a shock, Josh, because I had no idea. You know, nobody prepares you for that.__EOS__ You guys were empty-nesters, and I moved back in. What was it like having me around the house?__EOS__ It was difficult. You used to take the car and run it out of gas and leave it all over the city.__EOS__ Yeah, I remember that.",3
51986," The Senegalese love to dance and to make music. And right there at the airport in Dakar in 1974, drummers and dancers greeted the Jackson 5 as they stepped off the plane. The performance clearly inspired the 15-year-old Michael Jackson. He spoke about it in this vintage video posted on YouTube. __EOS__ I love the way, you know, they do their different dances. __EOS__ It didn't take Jackson long to join in the vigorous Senegalese dancing. That's the Michael Jackson Africa will remember, a musical genius with dazzling dance steps. My encounter with him was almost 20 years later in 1992 in Ivory Coast. Jackson was to be crowned a traditional chief. Now being a diehard Jackson 5 follower during my teeny-bop years, and now a journalist, I was as excited as his Ivorian fans about the visit. But it wasn't quite what we've expected. Jackson appeared to hold his nose as he stepped off the plane in Abidjan, proceeded to ignore the assembled VIPs and zoomed off in his limousine. Later, I managed to ask him just one question. How do you like Ivory Coast? The reply in this tiny, tiny voice was, beautiful. I love it. My foreword exclusive with Michael Jackson. __EOS__ But back here in Dakar, let me leave the last word to this young Senegalese singer who was in the middle of a sound check on stage yesterday but stopped to speak about the lasting influence of one of his heroes. ",2
51987," It depends on what actor. I mean, you know, for me - I mean, in France, that was only Mathieu Amalric could make the role because he has these eyes, you know. They are these eyes that are incredible.__EOS__ He plays Nasser Ali.__EOS__ Yes. And he has a fever inside his eyes. Or Isabella Rossellini. So when you have these actors that are like that - and they are not divas, and they are not there to give you hard time. They are really committed to the movie. When they add something - and I am just enchanted by this moment. I am so grateful that, you know, this man exists, and he can bring me this source. So no, no, there is no frustration.__EOS__ Let me follow up on Isabella Rossellini, 'cause she's got a wonderful star turn as Nasser Ali's mother. And it occurred to me that Isabella Rossellini, of course, was born of a relationship between her mother, Ingrid Bergman, and Roberto Rossellini, the film directo. That was one of the scandals of its time - which is about the same time of your story.",1
51988," Three months, huh? __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ Do you have spouses? __EOS__ Yes, we all do. ",2
51989," The traditional music from the plains of Colombia, it's the harp, the cuatro, it's a small guitar like a ukulele, they have the maracas. __EOS__ So they just play under the tree or something. They start drinking, and it's very sentimental music and aggressive at the same time. You know, it's… __EOS__ I like to show people that the harp, you can use it in different kind of music. The flamenco is very similar to the Colombian-Venezuelan music. Those effects, you know? Like you're playing like… __EOS__ Really aggressive, and like… ",2
51990," Mm-hmm. __EOS__ I do try to give people what they come for, but at the same time, sneaking a whole lot of what I feel they need. And so, you know, the same way we learn to talk by copying people older then us, and that's the way we progress. That's a good starting point, which, in turn, causes me to want to get better. I want to get better so that the younger generation has something better as their guide, you know? So I can help that way by improving myself. __EOS__ Tim, when you were growing up, whose licks were you stealing? __EOS__ Well, I mean, I was just like a lot of the people that I came to. I would, you know, I'd look up to people like, you know, Victor Wooten, like, you know, Stanley Clarke, like everybody. And I would learn to play, you know, note for note exactly like they would. ",0
51991," Yeah. And you loved that song forever, too. Like, it changed your life, you know? So if I could do that on like, prime time, then yes. __EOS__ Do you think - years from now, when you go back and listen to this record -""Wounded Rhymes"" - what do you think it will remind you of? Where in your life do you think it will take you back to? __EOS__ I mean, for me, I'm going to be like Benjamin Button, I think. I'm just going to grow younger, you know. So I think I will probably be, you know, happy, fat, with kids and looking back and be like, oh, I was such an angry young woman, you know? So probably like, dark years before I kind of understood that life is hard, but it's always beautiful. __EOS__ Happy and fat are not adjectives that we often think of, of aging Swedes... ",2
51992," And I was laughing. I was going to put the bra my head, you know, it didn't say in the contract. But I really needed to get paid.__EOS__ In your memoir you write about how when you found the song ""Heart Like A Wheel,"" the Anna McGarrigle song, which she sang with her sister Kate, that that song rearranged your entire musical landscape. First, let's start with why did you musical landscape need rearranging?__EOS__ Well, I'd come from this kind of sensibility. My grandfather loved opera, he loved ""La Traviata,"" that was his favorite opera, that's my favorite opera. And he had this kind of, you know, arty, refined sensibility, but he also look traditional music and he loved Mexican music, he was really passionate about that. So, and the same with my father, you know, he liked those things too. So the McGarrigles kind of married this incredibly traditional sort of refined aesthetic with, you know, just telling it like it is - sort of straight out, no bones about it the way they talk about stuff. And it was just this unabashed sentiment. They were unafraid of female sentiment.__EOS__ Well, it ended up being the title track of a 1974 album. Let's hear it. This is my guest, Linda Ronstadt, singing ""Heart Like A Wheel.""",2
51993," This is a recording of his performance of the Chopin ""Nocturne Number 20 in C Sharp Minor"" at that competition. It was the first annual International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition, at the height of the Cold War, in an unthawed Moscow into which Americans rarely ventured. __EOS__ Another American, Van Cliburn, won first place, helping to make both the award and himself famous. But Daniel Pollack won a prize, too. He was invited to tour all over the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries. He also became the first American to record an album for the Soviet Melodya label. __EOS__ I'm delighted to talk with you today. __EOS__ What a story, and it's hard to know where to begin. But let's begin 50 years ago. What possessed you to enter the competition? ",2
51994," No, that's great. __EOS__ His one - you'll see what I mean when you see the movie, the image at the end... __EOS__ That is good. __EOS__ I didn't even realize I did that. ",1
51995,"  I think about you, you and me. __EOS__  Really? __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ Okay. But? ",1
51996," Selznick's illustrations work like a camera, zooming in on details and following his characters around as they move through the world.__EOS__ Like in the beginning of ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret,"" you see a boy, you follow the boy. He disappears into a grate in the wall. You go down the hallway, you see an old man in a toy booth. You turn the page, he looks up. He sees a clock. You turn the page and behind the Number 5 in the clock, you see that boy. And then you turn the page and the text begins, and it says  From behind his perch, Hugo could see everything.__EOS__ In ""Wonderstruck,"" Selznick wanted to take this narrative experiment a step further.__EOS__ And so I had this idea to try to tell two different stories. What if I told one story just with pictures, and then told a completely different story that was set 50 years later with words? And then had these two separate stories weave back and forth until they came together at the end.",0
51997," Well, I also spoke to my grandparents, who stayed in Kiev, and the primary concern was to make sure that children weren't affected because they're most susceptible to the radiation. And so the children were the first to go. __EOS__ And your parents were sending care packages back to your grandparents. __EOS__ They were. My mother was collecting berries or buying them in the market when she was out in the countryside and making jam out of berries and closing the jar very tightly so that it would not be affected on its trip and sending it to my grandparents, along with some other things that they were able to buy outside of Kiev. __EOS__ Your grandparents eventually fell ill. And I'm wondering after all this time if your family will ever know if their illnesses were a result of the exposure. ",3
51998," It's very emotional. I mean, for me, the first time that I landed, I just remember there was a moment where I just, I didn't know what to do. I couldn't walk forward; I couldn't walk backward. I was so overcome by emotion that... __EOS__ You know, it's funny because I was born in Mexico City. I grew up in the United States. But I'm not Cuban and I'm not Mexican and I'm not quite American. __EOS__ And what was it like for the O'Farrills to be in Havana? I mean, what was the reaction from the audiences there? __EOS__ There was one concert in town called San Jose de las Lajas. And we were actually performing for free in the town plaza in front of a church in the birthplace of my great-grandfather. That's when Adam and Zack really first performed in front of the Cuban public. But I know the band was overwhelmed with emotion. ",1
51999," Seven or eight, something like that. __EOS__ When you were studying classical clarinet as a kid, what did you envision for your future? Did you think that you would be in an orchestra, you know, in a classical orchestra? __EOS__ Well, I thought about that, but I'd never seen that and... __EOS__ You had never seen an orchestra or never saw a... ",2
52000," I think after we got to some - the mixing stage on a couple of songs and, you know, it started sounded really good. You know, I would play it for some friends to just get reactions and stuff and their reactions were really encouraging. __EOS__  I'm pulling in to Butterfield Station. A baby's looking by at the highway flowers. __EOS__ Several Jayhawk bandmates joined you on this CD. How did you set this work apart from what the group had done? __EOS__ I don't think I did anything consciously. I actually picked the songs to ask them to play on based on how close they were to like the Jayhawks kind of a sound, so I may be - because I think they're only on one - I think they're just on one song as a group. ",2
52001," All right. Hang on, because we have to go to a break. __EOS__ Yeah, yeah. __EOS__ And we'll come back and you'll tell us more about this story because it is an amazing tale of how Bell - and you present the evidence, it was - some very fishy things were going on there in that patent office and - with Bell and his colleagues. So, stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. __EOS__ You're listening to Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about a book, a new book, that's out now in paperback by Seth Shulman. He is a journalist and an author. It's called ""The Telephone Gambit,"" and it's a book in which - let me just recap, because a lot of people may not have heard us - it's a book in which you present the evidence that Alexander Graham Bell virtually stole the key idea from his biggest rival of the day, Elisha Gray, correct? ",0
52002,"  Day-o, day-o...__EOS__ There's this smash hit from 1956, ""Banana Boat Song."" There's a film career that made great use of his matinee idol looks. And then there's Harry Belafonte, the activist. In the 1960s, he was a confidante of Martin Luther King's. By the '80s, he was organizing ""We Are the World,"" the anthem for famine relief in Africa. For all his success, though, his path was not a sure one. It was his beautiful voice that led this child of Jamaican immigrants out of poverty and struggle.__EOS__  Down the way where the nights are gay, and the sun shines daily on the mountaintop, I took a trip on a sailing ship and when I reached Jamaica, I made a stop. But I'm sad to say I'm on my way...__EOS__ Harry Belafonte never intended to be a performer. Back in the 1940s, he was a high school dropout in Harlem, just glad to have a job, which he made his own.",2
52003," I mean, that's a pretty good recommendation. It's hard to top that one. .__EOS__ No. I had vowed, I mean, from early on, to never leave the continent. And southern Africa seemed - with him there, I would have both the country that I loved but then I could be kept safe from the worst things that that country could throw at you, as it happened to my parents, you know, they had lost three children. And, you know, Charlie, with his sort of U.S. citizenship, which feels very unassailable when you're from somewhere like Zambia. It seemed like a perfect solution. But after we had been married for a couple of years, I contracted more or less permanent malaria. And I think that along with the corruption of the government just wore Charlie down and he wasn't prepared to stay.__EOS__ I'm touched by a section that I'd like you to read where you talk about, for lack of a better phrase, the kind of mindset that develops growing up in Africa.__EOS__  In southern and central Africa, tragedy roared at us and we roared back. We shared our dramas publicly, bled them on the corridors of hospitals, laid our corpses on the beds of neighbors, held our sorrows up in full light. We were volume 10 about our madness and disorder, even if we were also resilient and enduring and tough. We survived magnificently and pretended to qualities of stoicism, but actually, even the most silent of us shouted the disordered history of our lives and our bodies and habits.",0
52004," Yes, and I think there are some basic problems that we've got to solve. One is, of course, that there are millions of Americans who literally don't have adequate access to the health-care system because they don't have insurance coverage. __EOS__ Paul Krugman, why do you think we need reform? __EOS__ First of all, I'm shocked that Stuart didn't say anything I can disagree with right there. We do have an extremely expensive system by international standards, and one that leaves a lot of people without health-insurance coverage, and it leaves a lot of people who do have it worried. And there's something else, which is that those defects are getting worse. __EOS__ Stuart Butler, your views are based, in part, on spending the first 30 years of your life in England under the National Health Service. I should mention you're now an American citizen. What are some of the lessons you think we should learn from England's National Health Service? ",3
52005," It was performed a couple of times when they were warming up to bring it to Broadway and then it was cut when it was just getting started my own orchestra, Concordia. I couldnt resist digging it up and putting it back together. And so that recording you are hearing is a recording I made about 15 years ago. __EOS__ Now, of course, its inconceivable to think of anything that Gershwin wrote being cut from anybodys presentation. __EOS__ It is, but you know, somehow he  Im sure it bothered him, but theres no recollection really of him being upset about it. He made the contact, and this is how he met Paul Whiteman, who then said, oh, maybe Ill have you do a piece for this concert Im doing, you know, sort of an American jazz concert. And thats how Rhapsody in Blue came about. If that collaboration hadnt happen, who knows whether Rhapsody in Blue would have ever been written. __EOS__ Maestro Marin Alsop, music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. You can hear more music from Marin Alsop and read her latest essay on our Web site, nprmusic.org.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",2
52006," OK, well, I apologize again.__EOS__ Well, I apologize to you because then I did it to you probably out of resentment, ignored your emails because you ignored my phone calls back when there was no email.__EOS__ Well, can we get back on track or what?__EOS__ Yeah, I think we can.",3
52007," You thought all the heterosexual women were faking it?__EOS__ I just thought they were, like, putting up with it. Like, this is what women are like. You just put up with it. And then you tell him to go home. I mean, really if you read, like, Cosmopolitan magazine, those articles are just like hey, do what you can for that guy. Don't worry about yourself. I never thought of my own pleasure or my own attractions. I just didn't - it just didn't come up for me at all. I didn't think about it. And then I kissed a woman and I was like oh, I understand now. Yeah, that's how that's supposed to feel.__EOS__ And did you get into the comedy scene in Boston? Was that the first place that you...__EOS__ I did. Yeah, I started in improv when I was in college. And strangely, I was in the same improv group that Amy Poehler was in, like, 10 years prior. So when I started in improv, she was on SNL. So it was the first time that I ever imagined a possible future in comedy. Because I again, like, where I was raised it wasn't a - an arts career wasn't something I ever thought of. It was like there's three jobs - you'd be, like, an accountant, like, a miscellaneous businessman, you know, I don't know. But it was my first taste. And I did that for several years. And the day after I graduated from college, I got my first professional job doing improv at a theater in Boston.",3
52008," Yeah. Ten years old. __EOS__ It's kind of amazing, like very few relationships withstand the test of time from middle school to adulthood. __EOS__ I remember the first conversation we ever had was in -because we ended up in the same class. It was Miss O'Connor's class. And I met Mike pretty much the first week in school and then we, you know, he just ended up coming over to the house all the time and we just became really close. You know, I think somehow I think sometimes my father dying and Mike coming into my life at the same time sort of coincided. __EOS__ So Tre Cool, who's the drummer with the band, he grew up in an unusual way. He grew up in a home without electricity, no television, I don't know if he had radio or probably not a stereo or anything. So I think, stop me if I'm wrong here, that his father was a veteran who wanted to kind of like move away from the world when he got home and that's why they moved to like a mountain or something? Is that close to... ",2
52009," That's right. He's now the senior senator from New York. It was an unbelievable experience. Our grades suffered quite a bit from working on that campaign, but Schumer won. And Jay went on to a career in politics. I went into the arts. But every time he was working on a campaign, and I had time on my hands, and he was working for a candidate I believed in, he would rope me back in. So I worked on a number of campaigns  Bradley's 2000 presidential, Hillary's 2000 Senate race. __EOS__ That would be former Senator Bill Bradley and Hillary Clinton. __EOS__ And then eventually Howard Dean's 2004 presidential bid, where I was on staff out in Iowa. __EOS__ So, I'm dealing with a hard-core Democrat right now. ",1
52010," It's more the second version, except I do not write it down. I mostly wait for the songs that won't leave me alone to just be persistent enough that I'll finish them.__EOS__ Is it hard to remember what you've just written?__EOS__ Well, if it's hard to remember, I guess it wasn't good.__EOS__ Is that true?",2
52011,"   __EOS__  Let me ask you a little bit more about growing up.  We      understand that your brother was murdered when you were growing up.  What      kind of feelings do you have when you go home now, knowing that the place      that you grew up obviously you have such love for but also there was some      pain in your life associated with it. __EOS__   This is something that was very      difficult in my life, but now to go back to where I used to live and meet      the people that I knew at that time, it's very important for me now, as      it was then, because the people over there, the reverence that they have      towards me is of a guy that has always worked very hard to find not just      the place of my own within the society but equality within the larger      picture. __EOS__  Let me ask you about something that's been happening here in      the United States, the Hurricane Katrina.  Many people around the world      have seen the devastation and the black faces of people who survived      Katrina.  Did it surprise you or was this something that you expected      from the United States? ",2
52012," And Keegan-Michael Key plays Luther, Mr. Obama's anger translator.__EOS__  Luther?__EOS__  Hi.__EOS__  First off, concerning the recent developments in the Middle Eastern region, I just want to reiterate our unflinching support for all people and their right to a democratic process.",3
52013," Cloud spotter Gavin Pretor-Pinney. You can see his full talk at ted.npr.org. By the way, Gavin, where's the best place to look at clouds?__EOS__ The best place to go cloud spotting is in your backyard.__EOS__ Oh. OK.__EOS__ Clouds are the most egalitarian of nature's displays 'cause we all have a great view of the sky. And you don't have to go somewhere special to see them. You can - if you're in the right frame of mind - if you're paying attention to the sky, you will be able to see interesting, unusual, exotic formations wherever you are. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0
52014," That's exactly what I was thinking of. __EOS__ Yeah. That's - and I don't know which one was the chicken and which was the egg, whether it was Shakey's or Disney, but that's what it was like. And... __EOS__ Shakey's was like a sing-a-long pizza parlor where there'd be like, you know, old fashioned songs that... __EOS__ Yeah. ",2
52015," Yup. __EOS__ What changed? __EOS__ I think the fact that Im the father of four daughters and I've realized that, you know, they have all had, in their own way, terrorist training. __EOS__ I mean, at one time or another, and having been held hostage on numerous accounts, I mean, Ill buy them - you know, I have mellowed over time. And I've also realized that they are the boss, and Im living in their movie. ",1
52016,"  Thank you, Jacki.  Hello. __EOS__  ""Teacher Man"" is an amusing and grim chronicle both. __EOS__  Huh. __EOS__  Maybe you like--yeah. ",0
52017," Yeah. And European repression. He's freed from European repression. So in this film you witness your stepfather chopping off your mother's forefinger with an ax in punishment for her infidelity with Harvey Keitel. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ And you witness the infidelity when you peek through a keyhole and see your mother lying naked with Harvey Keitel. I'm guessing that when you shot this, you didn't actually see Harvey Keitel naked. __EOS__ No. No I did not. They, as with most films, shoot the interiors on stages and the exterior where I was peeking through, there was a bunch of camera equipment inside covered with, you know, blue - like rain protection gear. ",1
52018," We can bomb the world to pieces, but we can't bomb it into peace. __EOS__  You say you're sorry. Lord, there is no other choice. God bless the people, no, who cannot raise their voice. We can chase down all our enemies, bring men to their knees. We can bomb the world into pieces, but can we bomb the world to peace. __EOS__ I'm talking to Michael Franti. He's the front man with the band Spearhead. Their new record is called ""The Sound of Sunshine,"" and it was written and recorded after a pretty serious health scare. You thought you were going to die. __EOS__ Yeah. I was on tour with the Counting Crows, and we were opening for them. And I had all this abdominal pain. And I kept going to many doctors over a long period of time, and no one could figure out what it was. And finally, I felt this pop in my abdomen and my appendix had ruptured. ",2
52019," That they'll do something crazy. __EOS__ Exactly. __EOS__ Yeah, yeah, you know, that he's gonna feel some chick up or a kiss on the lips or something. __EOS__ Yeah, and everybody can throw a comment to him when they come up there. ",0
52020," And, you know, in dealing with infertility, it's such an emotional and serious issue for people. And how did you balance the subject matter with the genre? You know, essentially a kind of readable horror story.__EOS__ Well, I don't think that horror stories have to be just about things that are silly. I think that the things that make horror stories frightening is that they're about things that are very serious. But it pushes it to the edge and you explore the darkest possibilities of the story. So, I didn't really feel there was a conflict. I think that in any good story, something important should be at stake.__EOS__ Now this book - on the cover of the book it says, from a new name in horror, Chase Novak. And...__EOS__ It's a very, very new name in horror.",0
52021," So let's hear another song, and this is ""Give Me Novocain,"" and there's a line I particularly like in this  Bittersweet migraine in my head, it's like a throbbing toothache of the mind. I like the throbbing toothache of the mind. I think most of us have had a throbbing toothache of the mind. So ""Give Me Novocain"" reminds me of The Ramones title ""I Want to Be Sedated."" Were you thinking about that at all when you wrote it? __EOS__ No, I mean, that's definitely a kind of poetry that I definitely relate to, you know, a song like ""Now I want to Sniff Some Glue"" or something like that, it's, you know, I think that was a new way of, you know, writing lyrics and just, like, straight, right to the point, you know exactly what's going on. __EOS__ My guest, Billie Joe Armstrong, the front man of Green Day, will be back in the second half of the show. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. Im Terry Gross back with Billie Joe Armstrong, the front man of Green Day.

52022," Wow.__EOS__ ...you know, I have flaming red hair so that was even doubly great.__EOS__ And then, you know, they wed. Then in the middle of the song he has to leave her as he goes off to war, because there are bands of brothers falling. And then, of course, he has to die in the end. And the only way he returns to Virginia is to buried.__EOS__ Even though it's made up, it's moving to hear you say that.",2
52023,"  Yeah? How are we going to do that?__EOS__  You've heard of ""The Walking Dead""? Well, there's a chat show that runs after it called ""Talking Dead.""__EOS__  Yeah, I know, it's hosted by that comedian Chris Hardwick.__EOS__  Is there a problem between you two?",3
52024," But I also feel like that, you know, the real change is that since we've had a daughter, my wife told me that her mom was like, uh, so does that mean that Sami's black? Because she just never thought about that, you know, and in her life, I'm sure when she grew up and got married and had kids and thought about her kids' kids, she didn't picture a black granddaughter.__EOS__ We're all very used to the white guy with the black baby because you're like, oh, that's very nice of you to adopt that child from that place. But with me it was a whole different thing. We got a lot of stares and a lot of questions that I had to deal with while at the same time knowing that I didn't care what people thought, because this was my daughter.__EOS__ She thought of me as the one that didn't have milk. But that was a very important moment for me to realize that this is actually, that that's how embedded race is in me, which I think it's kind of sad but also that how exciting a moment that was for me that I know for sure this person doesn't think of me as black.__EOS__ Now, so much comedy club material is about sex and about being great at it or being terrible at it or getting it or not getting it or - anyway. So you've actually worked at a condom store and at a video store that sold adult videos. So I'm thinking you must have material galore, even though you're not the kind of comic who talks a lot about sex. What were those experiences like?",3
52025," Well, a little bit anyway. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ I mean Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that the military would ease the kind of evidence that could be used to out a service member. Some of those include ignoring anonymous complaints, making those who do file complaints do so under oath. __EOS__ I believe these changes represent an important improvement in the way the current law is put into practice  above all, by providing a greater measure of common sense and common decency to a process for handling what are difficult and complex issues for all involved.

52026," Let's get back to our interview with Patti Smith. __EOS__ No. Why would it? You know, I'm not a musician. You know, I don't play any - I didnt play any instrument. I didnt have any specific talents. I mean I came from the South Jersey, Philadelphia area, and in the early '60s everybody sang. They sang on street corners, three-part harmonies, a cappella. I knew - most of my friends were better singers than me. There was nothing in what I did that would give a sense that I should be in a rock 'n' roll band. Also, girls weren't in rock 'n' roll bands. I mean, they sang but, you know, the closest thing to a rock singer - a real rock singer that we had was Grace Slick and I certainly didnt have Grace Slick's voice. __EOS__ So, you found the guitarist Lenny Kaye. You read an article by him about a cappella groups and you really liked it and you found him. You sought him out. He was working at a bookstore in the Village. If you had not found Lenny Kaye do you think you wouldnt have been in a rock 'n' roll band? Because he has been your guitarist kind of forever. __EOS__ Well, I can't say what would happen. It was really Sam Shepard who suggested, you know, I said to Sam when Robert helped me, through Gerard Malanga, to get my first reading, I said I got to do something special because if I dont do something special Gregory's going to, you know, throw tomatoes at me or something - Gregory Corso, who was mentoring me not to be a boring poet.

52027," You know, there was a review of this album that I read and it ended, it was The New York Times review, and the piece finishes with this line  Sia is just learning to sound like herself. __EOS__ Hmm. It's true. I learned to sing by, well, there was a Doors song that I was obsessed by, I think it's ""Light My Fire,"" and it had this bit in it that goes da na na na na na na na na na na na. __EOS__ And that's not a vocal part of the song. __EOS__ No, but I was obsessed with just that bit of the song. So I had a cassette player and I recorded that bit like 60 times, then I would like lie down. I'd be reading my book or whatever and I'd be like play and it would go na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na... ",2
52028," Well, time is what you do get in Bruckner, because this is a 82-minute symphony. But you would be kind of bounced out of your chair after a while because it's not all this soothing. The kind of a well-known muscular, beefy side of Bruckner is all over in this symphony, especially in this scherzo that we'll hear now where Bruckner builds incredible tension and relief. It's very kind of in your face, super great playing by the Berlin Philharmonic with Simon Rattle. And I recommend turning the volume up on this one.__EOS__ Up to 11.__EOS__ Up to 11.__EOS__ It's kind of a head banging thing going.",2
52029," Well, thank you - because I believe that we don't have as much awareness of the institution of slavery from the perspective of the enslaved person and from the perspective of the person who self-emancipates.__EOS__ One thing in reading this book - it's about race and it's about slavery but at times it wasn't entirely clear what the race of the main characters was. And I'm wondering - Duncan Smoot, for instance, we assume he's a free black, though I don't think you ever state it out right. Was that by design?__EOS__ Well, yes. It is by design. I think that one of the difficulties we get into when you're writing is that you're creating a world in which you're bringing your characters and to a certain extent you collude with your readers. You are urging your reading to agree about certain descriptions and certain things. And I wanted to leave certain questions of biological identity open.__EOS__ So you're not going to tell us?",0
52030,"  Yeah. __EOS__  ...to relate to him, to connect their own experiences to      him. And it seems to me that it's actually far from being more forgivable      because it's literature.  It's more insidious because it's playing very      deliberately on the kind of available sympathies of, more or less, the      more desperate audiences. __EOS__  Yeah. __EOS__  And it--go ahead. ",0
52031," Yeah. __EOS__ As somebody who thinks there's something else going on here, it's not necessarily that I want that kind of relationship to happen… __EOS__ No, no, I - no, yeah. __EOS__ But I just do feel like he is feeling stirrings from Peggy, that he -that he's very uncomfortable with and he doesn't know what to do about it. And he's may be not even fully aware of it because he doesn't want to be aware of it, but that they're there. So… ",3
52032,"  If you're rich, you have succeeded. Otherwise, you have failed. There's no other criterion. Honest people are obsolete in today's China. Chinese critics say I shouldn't write like this, I should write from a positive, healthy perspective, conducting an autopsy on our sick society. But I say in this society, there are no doctors — we are all sick. __EOS__ A play based on the book was staged in Shanghai last year, adapted by local playwright Li Rong. He believes its power is in its depiction of China's morality vacuum and local government corruption. __EOS__  Baldy Li holds a lot of political power. He controls all the industry in the county. And this actually happens in local politics here. It's government by the strong for the strong. It's the politics of dirty money. __EOS__ These unblinkered views of modern China's failings and excesses make Yu Hua controversial at home. Four different literature professors refused to be interviewed about the author, citing the sensitivity of the topic. He's also unpopular among young Chinese. Yet, he, in turn, is critical of those born in the '80s for being too nationalistic. ",0
52033," I don't know. I mean, because I think, at some point, you have to try and learn as much as you can learn about your instrument. You know, I wouldn't recommend the way that I came to it, but I came to it the way I came to it. That's the way it happened. But I did eventually go back and learn the basic rudiments and - but then that leads you to the masters, in a way. You had to investigate people who've been there on that road and went a lot further. __EOS__ Like who? __EOS__ Oh, man, like Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, Sun Ra, Art Tatum, Bud Powell, and not just the piano players. You know, I listen to Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young, right on up to Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane and John Gilmore - all there wonderful, wonderful people. I mean… __EOS__ And have you heard that music before? ",2
52034," Yeah.__EOS__ That's what we're good for  breaking things.__EOS__ Let me translate here. What artist Sho Igarashi means is that the computer graphic artists will break the laws of physics to get the look they want. They're grappling right now with an upcoming animated film called ""The Legend of Tembo,"" trying to get feathers to behave. And the artists aren't happy.__EOS__ It looks like a - I don't know - something that's been hit by a Mack truck, and it's really not - it's like roadkill, and you don't want to look at it.",1
52035," Thank you so much.__EOS__ Thank you.__EOS__ Happy Mardi Gras.__EOS__ Galactic's new album is ""Carnivale Electricos."" You can hear Galactic live in concert on Thursday night at nprmusic.org or with the brand-new NPR Music iPad app.",2
52036," But that got a few laughs. But, he was very kind, Marlon. We rehearsed constantly, which is what you do on a Kazan film. __EOS__ Right. Now, in the movie, you have this like radiant, pure beauty, but in most of the scenes, you're wearing real schmatas. You're wearing this big drab, woolen coat… __EOS__ …and a kerchief around your head and… __EOS__ I still have that kerchief. ",1
52037," Yeah, OK.__EOS__ But at one point, you talked about your own father comforting you.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ And what did that experience kind of teach you about him or about fatherhood?",0
52038," Absolutely.__EOS__ So what was most difficult for you in being a Muslim and being from the Arab world and trying to find a place for yourself in the middle of - you know, as a young person in the middle of this kind of countercultural era in New York?__EOS__ Oh, there were three major problems and challenges I had. One was finding myself as a teenager who was brought up in different parts of the world, who never - who in spite of peer pressure and the natural pressure of wanting to fit in never felt that I completely fit in, into any society, including my own. When I went back to Egypt on holidays, I was made fun of by my cousins because I spoke funny. I spoke like a foreigner.__EOS__ Why did you decide to become an imam, and what did you do before that?",3
52039,"  Soul, soul sister. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Soul, soul sister. Hey. Whoa.__EOS__ How did this come together?__EOS__ Well, we started his tour in 2009, I think, and we were paying tribute to Nina Simone because her repertoire is vast. And also, her story is important for us to tell because when you're a woman in this business, it is hard. And on top of it, when you're a black it's even harder. And people like Miriam Makeba, Nina Simone, Odetta, Abbey Lincoln - I mean, all of those women have been there for us. They paved the way for us to be the free singers that we are today. So we decided after that first edition that we're going to open it to all different women singer-songwriter's of the 20th century. So we have Ani DiFranco in the repertoire. We have Joni Mitchell. We have Etta James. We have Shirley Caesar. We have even - I mean, we have songs that tell the story positively about women. It's not only victimize us. We are not victim. If we perceive ourselves as victims they would have won. And the question I always ask - and I'm still waiting for the answer - is what threat do we pose to men for us to be always the one that come after? Without us there is no manhood. Without women there's no humanhood. We give birth. Even though we need men for that, it's a relationship that have to be done in harmony. No one should be superior. We are partners in life together. You cannot disrespect the woman that gave you your children that you are proud of. If you dismiss her you, dismiss yourself, you dismiss your children.__EOS__ You save a little bit of that voice for later on. We thank you for spending some time with us. I hear that you are at work on a new album. Correct. And also a memoir. Do I have that right?",2
52040," Just from listening to it, I believe that a lot of the production dialogue, meaning the sound that was recorded on location, survived, where a lot of films, say, I'm just guessing, but say ""Star Trek,"" even though a lot of it was done on set, there are a lot of things that create the visuals that you see that ruin the production track. So, in a lot of cases, those films end up using the production sound as what we call a guide track so they can be re-recorded later. But that's not always the case but just something your listeners should be aware of. __EOS__ Doing it after the fact, in post-production? __EOS__ Absolutely. __EOS__ Russell Williams, enjoy the Oscars on Sunday. ",1
52041," Yeah, but I also love the new Web show, and I was wondering, I see some similarities between Fiona and Valerie Cherish and  well, sorry, I'm really nervous and excited. But I was wondering, are you  these days, are you more interested in playing roles like that, or do you see the similarities, and yeah? I'm just more excited to tell you how much I love you and love ""The Comeback"" and love the new show and all that, so... __EOS__ Oh, thank you, thanks. Well, do I see  you know, at the beginning, I saw some similarities, and that wasn't intentional. __EOS__ But, you know, Fiona's not a nice person, and Valerie actually was a really decent person, even if she was a little misguided. But Fiona's really not a nice person. So to me, they're very different. __EOS__ Let's hear from Ellen in Tulsa. Ellen, welcome. ",1
52042," ...with people with Asperger's syndrome. She's also been - is sort of in a crisis in the sense that the way she's been brought up and the sort of idealized view that she's had of her family is in the process of crumbling. And she is in the process of realizing that things that she took for granted or believed about her family and her family's relationships weren't true. So I think shes in a space where honesty and fidelity are especially salient to her at the moment. So I think some of the things that Adam offers, in terms of honesty and intelligence and the fact that he can be counted on, are very attractive. __EOS__ You know there's a moment in - early in the relationship where Adam reveals to Beth that he has this issue, this syndrome, Asperger's - and I'm sure that's something that you thought about when you were crafting the script, and it comes fairly early in the film so we're not giving away much - but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you decided he would reveal this to Beth. __EOS__ Right. First of all, I - you know, it does come a little later than I think you would ordinarily think to discover it - in our film. I mean, I think it's about third of the way through or whatever. And it was important to me that the audience kind of get to know Adam without necessarily putting a label on him. Of course, that's just for the first weekend of the movie because now everybody who's going to it - pretty knows - pretty much knows what it's about, but in terms of the experience of the film itself, you know, he is not labeled for, you know, the first half hour or whatever. __EOS__ And what he had done was to say something kind of inappropriate at that point in the relationship about the fact that he was sexually attracted to her and it put her off. That's where he jumps in and says, wait a minute, there is a reason I said something like that. ",1
52043," That's actor Mark Ruffalo. He had a breakthrough performance 10 years ago in the movie ""You Can Count on Me,"" and he's been a film fixture ever since. __EOS__ Callicoon, New York is a village tucked in a foresty corner of the Catskills; population, just over 200. That includes Mark Ruffalo, who seems to know everyone else, from the waitress at the diner to the guy who owns the wine store. __EOS__ Hey, Robin. __EOS__ Ruffalo has owned a home in Sullivan County since the early 1990s. That's when theater critics first began comparing him to Marlon Brando. ",1
52044," I'm sure that's right, although I do try to keep metaphors out of my books as much as I possibly can. But yes, I mean, half of my young, teenage years I spent living in a hotel. And very transient, as you say, people living in rooms and dying in rooms and doing bizarre and wonderfully scandalous things in rooms. Opposed to what my father, who died when I was 16, wanted more than anything, which was to have a house, to own a house, to live in the suburbs, to have that sort of serenity, that stability, that assurance that it would be there when he came back on the weekends. He was a traveling salesman. So for me, houses are full of drama because they're always supposed by the chaos that's constantly sort of inflicting itself on us. I mean, he grew up as - with my mother. They were married 15 years before I was born. They basically lived in their car, while he traveled with his job, for the 15 years of their life. They never owned a house. And then when I came along, then that was the excuse to buy a house. I think it was the happiest thing that he ever did in his life. So for me, houses have almost iconic status. I've lived in lots of houses. I've owned a few houses. I love looking at houses because it's shelter. I wrote it in ""The Sportswriter"" - a house is where you look out the window and see the world. And a house is where you'll die. A house is where you'll get divorced. A house is where you'll have your most sacred and most profane experiences. Houses for me are critical to my experience. And I guess I thought probably critical to many Americans' experiences. I mean, you know, the housing crisis which we're apparently out of - are we? The housing crisis was all about people needing and wanting and desiring and demanding houses.__EOS__ So, is that why you made Frank a realtor, now a retired realtor? He had started as a sportswriter, and then that ended and he became a realtor.__EOS__ Yeah. Well, when I decided I wanted to write about Frank, I couldn't make him be a sportswriter again 'cause I'd used that up. So I looked around and I asked myself, what do I know anything about that I could generate as a profession for Frank? Because for me, characters become more plausible when I can ascribe to them a profession, when there's a way in which I can say they earn a living. Then I can begin to believe in them and think that the reader will find them more plausible. And I knew a lot about real estate. I knew a lot about driving around in towns in realtors' cars and talking to realtors and looking in other people's houses and seeing their furniture and looking out their windows. What I didn't anticipate was - and I was just lucky, and in order to write novels you have to get lucky. I got lucky that housing turned out to be a kind of barometer for the national spirit at the time I was writing about it. But it's probably housing, as we know now, is a barometer for the nation's spirit all the time. But I just sort of tapped into that at a providential moment. But it was luck. It was pure luck.__EOS__ You know, as he gets older, Frank is trying to live more, like, in the present. And he doesn't have work weighing on him. You know, he's retired. But the past keeps showing up on his doorstep.",0
52045," The way forward is to focus on marketplace ethics. The financial crisis isn't really a crisis of technology. It's a crisis of marketplace ethics. You had these guys who targeted minority communities because of their greed and they basically forced these illegal financial products onto a population that could least afford them.__EOS__ Barry Zigas, what's your perspective on this?__EOS__ Well, I agree with that. The history of this crisis really starts with the rise of subprime unregulated lenders who, as Bill says, had found a new market particularly among new African American and Hispanic homeowners, but also in low and moderate income communities among families that had equity in their homes but didn't have great credit and were not being marketed to by traditional institutions.__EOS__ Well, conservatives would make the opposite point. They would argue that the pressure to lend to these previously underserved communities is what led to the crisis.",3
52046," Governing New York's Gorgeous Mosaic,"" and David Dinkins is with us now. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.__EOS__ Thank you very much.__EOS__ Mr. Mayor, you served 20 years ago. Why now?__EOS__ Well, others have written of me, and I thought it was high time that I told it my way.",0
52047," Now, did you work at changing your accent or did it naturally evolve? __EOS__ No, I had to work at it consistently. I found that some of my clients were picking up absolutely the wrong cues from me and they were walking out with a New York accent when I needed them to have no accent at all - what I call a standard American accent. __EOS__ Now, I noticed when you first gave us the weather report you said humid. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. ",1
52048," So it's funny, isn't it, because, you know, our popular imaginings of anesthesiologists is, you know, they sort of sit at the end of the table and do what the surgeon tells them to do, and occasionally they sneak off and do the crossword when they're a bit bored, when in fact it's much more dynamic role than that.__EOS__ So in what sense is the anesthesiologist flying the plane?__EOS__ Well, so I think, you know, anesthesia is a very subtle thing, really, because - you know, and it's a thing of great trust. The patient comes to you, and you wrest control of their physiology, their biology from them temporarily. You send them to sleep, and you take over much of the automatic function of their body.__EOS__ Have you been under anesthesia?",0
52049," So much so that I would lie on our little lawn and stare up at the sky and wait and wait and wait for some sort of definitive sign that would give me the courage to go in and tell my parents that I'd had it with being an atheist, that it was time for me to go to church. __EOS__ But it had to be church, not a synagogue? It wasn't going to be Judaism? __EOS__ I didn't even know about synagogues yet. __EOS__ Okay, this was really... ",0
52050," And that's what I was thinking, and I'm, like, I cannot believe that I went from a kid watching that to this. __EOS__ Well, Sean Penn is such like the method actor. Did you both, like, talk through the scene before doing it, and did he prepare for it differently than you prepared for it? __EOS__ Well, I mean, you don't really prepare for a kissing scene. I don't… I mean, I've never - I've been asked that a lot, like did you and Sean do preparation and that kind of thing? And if you think about it, like if I said to one of my female co-stars in another movie, like hey, why don't we go rehearse this love scene in my hotel room a bit, I don't think it would fly. __EOS__ And so you just don't really rehearse kissing scenes, whether it's male or female, and there's not really much to talk about. You know, you kind of both know how to kiss, you assume, and you just do it. I guess if - I think Sean took some breath mints - and you just do it. ",3
52051," Well, it's interesting that you mentioned that because my Rabbi Willig, where we live in New York, wrote in his approbation, or his haskamah, to my book - to my sefer - he said, you know, there are people who think that looking for a source and wasting time doing that is part of learning Torah. And he cited the famous Rabbi Hutner, the former rosh yeshivah, the former head rabbi of the Yeshiva Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn, who said, no. That is not part of learning. It's not part of working for the Torah. It's no mitzvah to spend time, to waste time looking for something if it can be found more handily.__EOS__ Well, congratulations.__EOS__ Well, thank you very much, and thank you again for having me.__EOS__ Daniel Retter is the author of the - say it again for me. The HaMafteach? The HaMafteach?",3
52052," Oh, that's good. But they note that names come and go in cycles. __EOS__ Yes, absolutely. What people want in a name is they want to feel like they're finding something that is unique and yet familiar. So they want to pretend that they're coming up with something new when really, it's something that's been around for a long time. So as soon as people forget how popular Fred used to be, they're going to come right back and name their children Fred again. __EOS__ Hmm. And where does the name Fred come - is it short for Frederick or I guess for some people, it's short for Alfred. __EOS__ It's short for both, and I think that Alfred has a very British and Batman-y sound to it, you know? Alfred the butler. ",3
52053," Don't look at it. Don't tell.__EOS__ Well, it's brutal. You're playing 13 cities next month from New York to Dallas.__EOS__ Oh, I know.__EOS__ The following month is just as busy. Are you concerned about overdoing it now?",2
52054," ...for us... __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ ...this is a fairly wonderful place to live. So number one, I was very fortunate with that. __EOS__ Wow. That's in - from Brooklyn. Yeah. ",1
52055," Anyway, I fell in love with flying and Dave actually emailed me, you know, a couple years ago a little bit after the assignment and said, hey, a buddy of mine who used this plane to track wolves, this 56 Cessna, it's a beautiful plane, he's selling it cheap. You should buy it. And I did.__EOS__ Right. He will enjoy the book, I'm sure.__EOS__ Yeah. Oh, yeah.__EOS__ But did I get this right? You're afraid of heights?",0
52056," The way the story came out, as I remember it, is usually over Sunday brunches I would be reminded, as I was sitting with my mother, of my mother's mother. And I could never fathom her not having had a mother. So I would ask her limited questions, and I would gauge her reactions. And when she seemed too sad, I would stop asking. __EOS__ And I have to say, at this point, it's almost unbearable to say that Rita, you literally watched your mother and your little brother die in that attic. __EOS__ Yes, I did. __EOS__ And it's just, you know, words fail, words fail. But I wanted to ask how each of you began to see the way in which that trauma was affecting the way you raised your own children, and the way you were being raised. Leslie, why don't I start with you? ",0
52057," Right, but the other thing I see is that their skill sets, as far as being able to negotiate and communicate, has decreased, and that's given me better leverage than I've had in the past. __EOS__ I think that's true also, but in many cases, let's say with an owner of a club who is socially inept and doesn't like to negotiate, he will throw his president or his general manager in the negotiations. That's why a lot of teams will have, quote, the president of player personnel. That's just another word for he's your chief negotiator for that team or that player or that owner. __EOS__ Correct. __EOS__ Well, Mike, good luck on the deal. ",0

52059," We know from speaking to the prime minister's team that this was a hugely controversial decision even amongst his supporters. I mean, this is an unfolding nuclear disaster. The prime minister, pretty much on a whim, jumps in a helicopter, flies the 200 kilometers up from Tokyo to the Fukushima plant and lands at the site of what we now know was a triple nuclear meltdown.__EOS__ And so they decided they could manually vent the gases, but there was a problem, which was that a lot of people were in the surrounding countryside, and you interview one of them, a farmer. Just tell us what his experience was.__EOS__ Well, we met one resident, he lived at - well, we met many residents - but in the film, we focus on a resident called Noriyo Kimura. He lived just two miles from the nuclear plant. And he, like many of the people who lived around the - in that area, had lost family in the tsunami. In fact tragically in his case, his father, his wife and his youngest daughter were all swept away in the wave.__EOS__ We're speaking with investigative reporter and documentary producer Dan Edge. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.",3
52060," In what way was he an unhealthy influence?__EOS__ Well, he was destructive, self-destructive, and I think he was destructive to people around him. He was incapable of being happy. And he was just sort of brutally insensitive. I remember I was a correspondent at the LA Times in the Atlanta office and a giant box arrived. And I opened it up and there were maybe 20 gifts, little gifts, like dollar gifts - things you'd buy at a 99 cents store - a kazoo. I remember there was a picture of Yogi Berra - and each gift had a tag and one - they said like eighth birthday, 11th Christmas, 14th birthday. It was just - it was horrifying because it wasn't really an attempt to make up for all those birthdays and Christmases that he had missed. It was an attempt to salve his own conscience. So he just didn't get it, he never got it, and as he got older he got it even less and less. All I wanted him ever to do or be was kind and there.__EOS__ And that was more than he was capable of. He tried the grand gesture. He tried the makeup gift, and it just it always felt fake, forced. He just, he seemed incapable of being genuine and present and just a dad.__EOS__ My guest is J.R. Moehringer, author of the 2005 memoir, ""The Tender Bar,"" and the new novel, ""Sutton.""",0
52061," Cholera is a waterborne bacterial disease that causes very distinctive, explosive watery diarrhea, and it can shrivel a very healthy person, kill them in a matter of hours. It's really one of the few infectious disease emergencies that we see. It's also, of course, a public health emergency because it's spread through poor sanitation. __EOS__ Well, let's talk about them, the state of health conditions and particularly the cholera epidemic. Is that under control? __EOS__ No, no, the cholera epidemic is not under control. It is - just a little bit of background, it's the first big recrudescence of cholera in the Americas since the end of the - an epidemic that really swept through Peru and ended in 1993, perhaps. I think that was - the last cases were around then, maybe '94. __EOS__ the number of cases and the number of deaths. It's a big rebuke to public health and to all of us working in health care in Haiti. ",0

52063,"  Yeah, I know. __EOS__  Why?  Do you resent me? __EOS__  No!  No.  No, no, no, no.  No. __EOS__  Because, you know, we never did this before today, either. ",3
52064," So how did Clarkson deal with mainstream pop expectations? __EOS__ You know, I come from a small town, and people always had expectations of what you should say, how you should think, and what you should wear and how you should be. And I've always just kind of been like, you know, whatever I'm happy with. __EOS__ Clarkson also stands out from many of her pop star peers in her resistance to hypersexualization. That's also one of the biggest differences between icons of the '60s, '70s, '80s and today. __EOS__  Here she comes, looking pretty. ",2
52065," Well, one of the things that we decided is - I mean, if they go first with this project beyond writing an entertaining story, is to really shed light on the fact that Shakespeare's characters had stood the test of time for a very good reason. They are arguably the most brilliant characters ever created. I mean, they are so universal. So we wanted to make sure that we brought these characters out, but by the same token, we didn't want to get ourselves bogged down. So we actually made a point of - oh, we read a bunch of these plays. We made a point of not doing some sort of line-by-line exegesis so that we could get every last little bit right, because half the fun is the what-if angle, the just, you know, throwing the creative juices to the wind and seeing what came to us. __EOS__ Who do you think your audience is? __EOS__ Our audience is wide. I mean, first of all, you've got the natural-born lovers and aficionados of Shakespeare. But, you know, we want, as Conor mentioned, I mean, we want to grow it from beyond that. We want 15-year-old boys who are stuck in the class reading ""Romeo and Juliet"" to not - just not appreciating it or not enjoying it - to, you know, read the comic book and then go, wow, you know, Juliet is hot. __EOS__ We're talking with the co-authors of ""Kill Shakespeare,"" Conor McCreery and Anthony Del Col.

52066," I imagined a very placid and upscale, very, very religious somewhat conservative Christian community, which is Princeton in 1905-'06. And I imagine the phenomenon that having completely denied this social injustice, the reality of racism, that there would be incursions from the unconscious or incursions from, let's say, the other side. That which is denied is emerging. So, I thought of this in terms of vampires and demons and these forces from the unconscious, so to speak, erupting in this placid community, where people seem to be seeing vampires or maybe they actually are seeing them. They're having hallucinations or maybe these creatures are actually real. In gothic fiction, the border between reality and surrealism is quite porous, as in our own dreams.__EOS__ I made note of a line. The Reverend Winslow Slade is a major character, I guess, what, former governor and Presbyterian minister. I was struck by the line  It was not that God failed to give Winslow Slade the clear knowledge of what he should do, but rather, God withheld from him the strength with which to do it. Is this a novel that tells the story of conscientious people that can't find their conscience?__EOS__ I think that's a good way of putting it. It's the sort of inextricable presence of evil in good people, which they don't acknowledge and which they try to hide. But there was at least one person, one leader - moral leader at the time, and that was Mark Twain. He's a minor character in the novel, and I've written about him elsewhere. But there were people who spoke out against lynchings and racism. There just were not very many. And there were people who spoke out in favor of women's rights, just not very many.__EOS__ May I ask if Princeton, present-day Princeton, the university and/or the town, have registered any reaction to what you have written?",0
52067," We are seeing effects on animal populations in subtle ways, but they're getting less subtle. One thing that's kind of striking, you know, we talk about ecosystems, you know, the whole ecosystem is going to have to move north as the climate gets warmer to look for comfortable temperatures. But what biologists are seeing is that an ecosystem is composed of many, many species, and those species react differently to climate change. Some are more resilient, some are less resilient, and there have been a number of studies - for example - that show that migrating birds are being affected in a kind of a surprising way, which is to say they migrate partly to keep time with the changes in species, the flowering of plants or the emergence of butterflies or whatever, in the place that they migrate to.__EOS__ We use a lot of fresh water. I mean the growing population of the Earth. What will the impact of climate change be on the availability of potable water?__EOS__ There's a lot of evidence that there will be a negative effect on potable water - on fresh water. One reason is that the snowmelt that comes down from the Himalayas and the Sierras and the Andes, and the other great mountain ranges of the world, and waters of the lowlands throughout the summer is melting earlier. So the streams fill up with water in the spring and they rush with the, you know, babbling brooks and so on, but then they run out. And they run out earlier in the summer than they used to and that means that there is the water is no longer available, it's gone.__EOS__ The book also mentioned some effects not so widely discussed - potential effects of climate change - like infectious diseases. How might they be impacted?",0
52068," That's the one we wrote in Washington. And that was because people felt that ""Mix"" was too violent. So we wrote the ""Jet Song,"" which is very mildly threatening and menacing. And we got to Washington, and then everybody sort of felt that maybe it was a little too gentle. So we wrote something called ""This Turf Is Ours""  This turf is ours, drew a big white line with a keep out sign, and they crossed it. This turf is ours, gotta hold our ground, or we'll turn around, and we've lost it. __EOS__ Now, the song ends with, you know, we're going to beat every whole  every whole buggin' gang on the whole buggin' street on the buggin' whole ever-lovin' street. Did you want to use the F-word there? __EOS__ Oh, sure. I wanted this to be the first musical to use , and in fact, I first used it in ""Krupke."" I wanted the last line of ""Krupke"" to be  Gee Officer Krupke,  you. __EOS__ Right. My guest is Stephen Sondheim, and he has a new book called ""Finishing the Hat  Collected Lyrics  with Attendant Comments, Principles, Heresies, Grudges, Whines and Anecdotes."" ",0
52069,"  We used to spend Sunday mornings together, and it's just kind      of sad and happy at the same time; just mellow and--so I really liked it.      It always made my heart feel warm inside. __EOS__  You mean the song called ""Sunday""? __EOS__  Yeah, ""Sunday."" __EOS__   Sunday comes along today--that one? ",2
52070," He's fine. I know you're still mesmerized by how fine he is. And I mean F-O-I-N-E, foine.__EOS__ Exactly, foine.__EOS__ Foine. He's fine, as is everybody in the cast.__EOS__ Yeah, we're lucky.",1
52071," If you're just joining us, our guest is actor Andy Serkis. He stars with James Franco in the new film ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" Well, we have to talk about Gollum, your portrayal of the creature in ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. This is really an amazing effect. __EOS__ Gollum used to be a hobbit called Smeagol, and he was one of a clan that lived by a river. And he comes across the ring via his cousin, who discovers it when they're fishing one day. And he falls into the river trying to catch a big fish, and Deagol, his cousin, comes across this shining object at the bottom of a lake and brings it up. __EOS__ And describe him physically, what his face looks like, what his body looks like. __EOS__ He's very gnarled and very thin. He's emaciated. He has a few strands of hair. He's got scars all down his back. He's got a handful of teeth and huge kind of luminous, bulbous eyes. ",1
52072,"  Right, it's a little more ominous in this book. Service contracts are the death contracts that these big corporations sell to well-off people who are getting old and who are managing their moods in the face of this terribly transformed world they can't really stand to live in, with the pills that these same corporations are hawking to them. So the same companies that manage moods of the privileged few also manage their exit from the world. Nat and Sam's parents have finally bought a contract on themselves, and in their contract, they go to this resort in Hawaii on the Big Island. And their last week is managed by a corporation.__EOS__ We don't want to give away narrative points, obviously, but there was a part of me that read this book and kept waiting for Nat and/or Sam to shout at their parents. Why are you leaving us in this world?  I need you...__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ ...Stick around.",0
52073," It is funny now, but not so funny then. __EOS__ No, no, no, but there was smoke, and I always though that that smoke that came from different places of Santiago and mingled in the air was, in some strange way, like the incineration of the books but the books were speaking to each other as they floated away into the air. Yeah. So ""The Communist Manifesto,"" I didn't find it when I came back because my wife had gotten rid of it.  __EOS__ Panahpour, thanks for the call. We're glad your books back.  __EOS__ Thank you. ",0
52074," There's another song on this record that's called ""I Guess It's Going to Rain Today."" For those who have not been to Bergen, in Norway, and I've been there, it's a town where you really don't know if it's going to rain that day because the morning might be beautiful, and at night, it might come pouring down. __EOS__ You know, I grew up there, and I'm from there, and I live there. And I didn't realize how rainy Bergen was until I lived in Oslo, just on the other side of the country. And I was shocked at how dry that fall was. It was shocking to me. __EOS__  But don't take word for it. I don't know, but I guess it's going to rain today. I don't know, but I guess it's going to rain today. __EOS__ You've been recording since you were a teenager. Can you talk a little bit about how you got noticed as a songwriter growing up in Bergen? ",2
52075," I am. I block it out until the evening. __EOS__ Absolutely. But I'd like to talk to you about the film and the character that you play in it. Your character basically says that anyone who is abused grows stronger because of it, and you actually horrify your teacher. She's a researcher and she's basically using personal experience to find out what men think about women. Why is that moment so pivotal? __EOS__ Well, I think, it finally makes her question the interviews which have been taking place. And I think she's been getting answers which she in a way expects. This comes from a totally different place that she can't comprehend. __EOS__  Existence and life break people in all kinds of awful  ways all the time. Trust me, I know. I've been there. This is the big difference, you and me here, because this isn't about politics or feminism or whatever. For you this is just ideas. You've never been there. ",1
52076," Right, a confidential filing at the patent office. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ And it's virtually identical. __EOS__ Yeah. ",0
52077," Yes, that's - in my experience, intolerance and depth of religious commitment just don't correlate at all. I mean - even perhaps the opposite. I've known lots of people who are kind of - let's say - lax agnostics, where they aren't very invested into it but they just take for granted that religion is passe and so on. And they are, in some ways, incredibly intolerant. Certainly, they have no understanding for what they're denying.__EOS__ But if one truly believes as either a Christian or a Jew - or a Marxist, for that matter - that there really was no divine prophecy related through the Koran, can one be tolerant? When somebody regards that as somebody else's belief, but absolutely out of the ball park for oneself?__EOS__ Well, there still is something very mysterious here. There is something very great and I think captiv- I'm not a Muslim. See, I'm a Christian. About this whole idea of the Koran, of the recitation of God's word recited like that, it's a very profound and powerful idea. There's something so important and so captivating and so interesting here that I would feel I'm not acting as a human being if I don't try to understand it.__EOS__ Well, Professor Charles Taylor, winner of the 2007 Templeton Prize. Once again, congratulations and thanks...",3
52078," Definitely. But it's that ability that takes it - like, even in regards to a drummer, you can have a 45-armed drummer that can play forever if it's a computer, but it's not going to have that groove that a human drummer has. It's not going to have that, like, slight hesitation or the stronger impact.__EOS__ You can do everything you want to make a computer try to sound like a cello, but it's not going to sound like a cello.__EOS__ You premiered your first orchestral works with - I guess, it was the Canadian orchestra, the Kitchener-Waterloo.__EOS__ The Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony. I wrote for orchestra in college, but it'd been a long, long time since I'd communicated with players. So, like, I don't know. Those experience sort of like, shook me. And it was like, you need to remember this, get back to work. Computers aren't all there are, Dan.",2
52079," Yeah.__EOS__ Was that Dermot Mulroney?__EOS__ That was Dermot Mulroney playing Talget, yeah.__EOS__ Talk about that scene.",1
52080," Like up here, right there, like 49 and Broadway?__EOS__ Yeah. Yeah, it was like right up there. And we'd unload all of our equipment and just play right like in front of our bus. And then, when we were done, we'd pack back up into the bus and drive off__EOS__ And what was your connection to the rest of the world, kind of out that window?__EOS__ Well, sometimes on days when we weren't playing, we would just be parked on the side of the road, like in the middle of the city. So you're just like looking outside the window and there are so many different types of people walking by. And you're just wondering about their lives, what do they do, where do they work. And you're just people-watching the whole day. You know?",2
52081," So what was it that you needed to do lighting-wise to get his look right? __EOS__ Yeah, the bottom line of it is it all had to be overhead lighting, because, I mean, there were two things. They didnt really want to see his eyes that well, although I was criticized for it because I didnt want anybody to say, well, you didnt want to quite know what he was thinking all the time, you know. __EOS__ There's this great operatic sequence in ""Godfather I"" that intercuts between a baptismal scene in a church and these Corleone mob murders. And could you talk a little bit about the kind of shooting that you did to give it that operatic look? __EOS__ What happened was it was Francis's idea to use this counterpoint of taking this baby, this child in the environment of a church and the dialogue that went with it denouncing the devil, etcetera, and at the same time putting the counterpoint of killing everybody against that image. So that idea in itself sort of holds the whole thing together. ",1
52082," I've always been kind of a glass half empty guy, always trying to understand all the problems in front of me and then work the problem, work the problem always was my intention. I wasn't normally a very religious guy. A lot of prayer went into bucking me up.__EOS__ You had a lot of support during your recovery. You received one letter though, from a 9-year-old boy...__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ ...that meant a lot to you. Can you tell us about Jackson Cunningham?",3
52083," Is this, as far as we know, a condition, something with a genetic or biological basis, or is it a disease?  __EOS__ Well, autism... __EOS__ Yeah.  __EOS__ ...or the savant syndrome?  ",0
52084," The documentary ""Restrepo"" was not only a great documentary, but one of the best war movies I've ever watched.__EOS__ No, I didn't. But we certainly promoted the film and then continued to promote it because that was a film that we wanted people to see to say, this is what it's really like to be in the trenches in war and particularly with people as valiant as these guys were. And so we took that film and pushed it as best we could. You know, we are a nonprofit organization, so there's a certain point where we have to stop. But we tried to use that 10 days at the festival to do what we can to push those films out to wider audiences because that's the main objective of Sundance, is to not only support independent voices through film, but also do whatever we can to get those films to as many people as possible to see. So ""Restrepo"" was a wonderful example. So was the film called ""Buck,"" about a man working with horses in a kind way rather than cowboying them by beating them and kicking them and so forth. So there are those films that I'm actually quite proud of.__EOS__ ""Buck"" is up on the short list for this year's Academy Award. We featured Buck Brannaman when he was - the film was shown at the Silverdocs festival last year so.__EOS__ Well, I used him on a film that I did before, ""The Horse Whisperer,"" years ago as a kind of an adviser, and I got quite connected to him. Then I realized that this was an exceptional human being that more and more people needed to know about, so we were happy to put his film in the festival. And now, it's going on its way. That's great.",1
52085," I think you nailed it when you said, oh, there must not have been a woman in the room when they said this because its just, its so obvious. Its so obvious that we wrote it. __EOS__ So obvious you wrote it five years ago. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ All right, thanks, you guys. ",3
52086," This song that we're hearing, called ""Harold T. Wilkins,"" it's about a man who spent much of his life studying evidence of ancient astronauts who visited Earth. How did you stumble on the story of Harold T. Wilkins? __EOS__ Well, I found a book - I mean, it's about flying saucers - in a charity shop. Yeah, it was from the �50s when it was, you know, still credible to actually call it flying saucers. __EOS__ And I guess you chose him because he was this sort of oddball, in a sense. There's a line in the song  There was always a question hanging over you. And I guess that's sort of what it's about? __EOS__ Yeah, it's about sort of an outsider character, you know, waiting for something to happen. ",2
52087," Jeff Goodell, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So what does the bill that the House passed look like? Give us a real, like, layperson's explanation of it. __EOS__ Well, it's a  the first thing it does, the most important thing it does, is it sets up the architecture for what's called a cap and trade system. __EOS__ So there's permits that are given out by the government with a limited amount of greenhouse gases that can be released. So you can buy permits or sell permits, and theoretically, that limits to a predefined amount the amount of carbon gases that are going to released into the environment. __EOS__ Right, and the beauty of a cap and trade system, as opposed to, say, a carbon tax, which some people have advocated, is a cap says  Here is what we're going to emit. We're going to emit X number of tons as a nation, and you as a company have this much that you can emit. And so we know how much is essentially being emitted. ",0
52088,"  Fiddle-dee-dee. War, war, war. This war talk's spoiling all the fun at every party this spring. I get so bored I could scream. Besides, there isn't going to be any war. __EOS__  Not going to be any war? __EOS__  Why, honey, of course there's going to be a war. __EOS__  If either of you boys says war just once again, I'll go in the house and slam the door. ",3
52089,"  Well, you know what? __EOS__  Nothing cute and cuddly.  Skunk. __EOS__  That's the new thing now.  That's the new thing. __EOS__  Yeah.  That's the thing. ",3
52090," I think it's also the part of it. Joel, what do you think? I don't know if he is the fashion guy or he brought in the fashion guys, but it's an interesting point. What do you think, Joel? __EOS__ I like the idea. We get some Dolce and Gabbana involved in this. We get some Gucci. We brand the whole orchestra. I think he's thinking right. __EOS__ Now, are you being serious, Joel, or are you making fun of this? I'm trying to figure it out. __EOS__ No, I'm not sure myself. ",3
52091,"  That girl is bad news, Dad. I mean, honestly, she smells like Lifesavers, and she has a Midwestern accent, un-ironically. Moreover, she should be paying us rent. She's here a lot.__EOS__  Jamie is going to be moving in, sweetheart. You're going to have to find another place to live now.__EOS__  What? She's 26.__EOS__  She's 30.",1
52092," Yes. This has not been eye-opening. This has been heart-opening for me. The person I would like to interview is the only grandparent I never really knew because he was a man of mystery. His wife, my grandmother, was always just incredibly much a lady and delightful. But my grandfather had been a wealthy wheat farmer up in Saskatchewan and in the dark of one night, so the family story goes, he took his wife and four little children and fled to come down to Iowa. __EOS__ His faculties. Yeah. __EOS__ �I feel sad because when I look at the pictures, I really want to know him and want to know why. My grandmother's fervent wish was that all of her sons would become Methodist ministers. And I know she joined WCTU and I just wonder if that's a reaction to whatever happened. __EOS__ The Women's Christian Temperance Union, yeah. ",3
52093," Six years old, his mother is killed in her auto accident, and he's being raised by a drunken, alcoholic father who beats him and throws him out of the house. And he's living on the streets, you know, from the time he's eight, nine years old. And so, he joins the military, and it becomes a part of his family. And these were some of the soldiers who are in Tiger Force. And, you know, it's - the more we looked into some of the characters, we found some of those common threads. __EOS__ Yet, to be fair, there was another character - a guy who turns out to be, in fact, one of the heroes of this story, I guess. But, a man who was raised under very different - under very similar circumstances, as you described  intense poverty, single mother, all of that, and tried to stop the killings. __EOS__ Correct. That was Gerald Bruner. And Gerald Bruner had a very difficult upbringing. He was from Evansville, Indiana, and I think his mother packed he and his two brothers up when he was six years old and moved out to California, and his mom was a waitress and did lots of odd jobs. And he basically grew up in the Watts, you know, area of Los Angeles, and he always had a sense of justice. __EOS__ Doyle, yeah. ",0
52094," What do you mean by that?__EOS__ My trajectory was like, OK, hey, I'm getting my life in order. I'm getting my accounting degree. I'm not as dumb as I thought I was. You know, like you're starting to feel good about yourself. And then we started doing this music thing and it's changed my life completely.__EOS__  Young love has made me old, worn down like a shoe...__EOS__ So, Paul, where does this fiery passion come from?",2
52095," Yes.__EOS__ I guess it's a sort of an unhappy love song. So tell us about those words.__EOS__ They're very sad, aren't they?__EOS__ But the music is not sad.",2
52096," Yes, that's exactly, I think, the point was with this type of book that everyone can find something interesting in it. And as I said, who doesn't love zombies nowadays? They're like the coolest thing.__EOS__ Well, thanks very much for joining us and good luck in school.__EOS__ Thank you.__EOS__ Haley Baron joined us by phone from St. Edward's University. Max Brooks is still with us. By the way, we wanted to play a clip of tape from when you're on this program back in 2006 and we had callers play along as if the zombie apocalypse had taken place, and you gave advice to a caller dealing with some family issues.",0
52097," Good afternoon. Yes, my question regards English homes. When I studied at Oxford for several months, I noticed that in the bathroom, there were two separate faucets for hot and cold water. Rather than having hot and cold faucets that you turned on and plumbed into one spigot head, there was actually a hot side and a cold side. And it was very common at the university and in the local restaurants. So I'm wondering is that an English custom? Is that a European thing?__EOS__ And I...__EOS__  evolved from two-to-one faucets?__EOS__ Abigail, I can just I just encountered one of those this weekend in Yorktown, Virginia, in a very old house. Bill Bryson.",0
52098,"  The story of the Penderwicks, motherless children on this      summer adventure, staying in this house, it seems to me a bit of a      throwback.  Their adventures are rather innocent, too, and I think that's      a bit of a departure from some of the popular preteen books that you see      these days on the shelves. They tend to deal with a lot harsher, more      explicit topics. __EOS__  That was intentional.  There were some rough parts of my      childhood, as I expect there are of many children's childhoods.  And      because my childhood was in the '50s and early '60s, the only books I had      to read were these innocent adventures.  So for me, my paradigm was that      when things got rough, I escaped into innocence.  I didn't escape into a      book about children who were also having difficult times.  And I really      believed in that and that's what I wanted to give to children and frankly      that's what I wanted to write about, kids getting lost or climbing trees      but yet with a sense of humor and a sense of impending danger that a      child can have when the danger is whether or not they're going to get wet      that day.  And for children that are leading relatively safe lives, those      are big dangers and they need to work through them, too, not just the      terrible things. __EOS__  Can you read a favorite passage for us from ""The Penderwicks""? __EOS__  Sure, I'd love to.  This is from Chapter 3 called The      MOOPS.  `It was Batty's bedtime.  She had taken a bath, brushed      her teeth and put on her mermaid pajamas and now she was standing in the      middle of her Aarondell bedroom looking around.  The butterfly wings      were hanging on the closet doorknob ready for morning.  Her favorite      picture of Hound, the one that her father had framed, was on the little      white dresser by the window. Rosalind had put Batty's special unicorn      blanket on the bed and Frederick the horse, Funty the blue      elephant, Eursalla the bear and Fred the other bear were sitting on      the pillow.  It was an OK bedroom, Batty decided, not as safe and cozy as      her room at home, but at least the closet had that secret passage into      Roslyn's room.  Nothing scary could hide in a closet like that, not with      Roslyn right there.' ",0
52099, And we're talking with Zola today on TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. __EOS__ You pronounce it nice. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ Kind of rhymes with a dollar. There's hope. ,2
52100," But as you asked me the first question, I'm just continuing as the snowball continues. And then… __EOS__ Yes, you are a snowballing, yeah. Go ahead, though. __EOS__ Yeah, and then after, I thought, oh, I'd like to be kind of active in this retrospective film because I'm not interested in the past. And so, I thought of those portraits, you know, doing those portraits of directors, as well as self-portraits, you know… __EOS__ These are your paintings of… ",1
52101," Well, no doubt face blindness has always existed, and now one can read earlier accounts which didn't use the phrase but say this is what it must have been. The defining paper was by a German neurologist in the 1940s and he coined the term prosopagnosia - ""prosopon"" is the Greek for a face or a mask -for this apparently specific difficulty recognizing faces. He gave some case histories, and in one case a young soldier who had had a brain injury lost his ability to see faces, couldn't recognize his own wife if she was in nurse's uniform but did recognize a particular nurse. But it turned out that this was because she had such shining white teeth and that he recognized the shining teeth, although not the face. __EOS__ In a mirror. __EOS__ ...in a mirror, and there have been many ludicrous incidents in which I have apologized to my reflection, and another even more ludicrous incident in which I was sitting outside a restaurant and turned to the window and was using my reflection to comb my beard, which I have a habit of doing, and I saw my reflection was not combing its beard, but that on the other side of the window pane there was a bearded man who was puzzled as to why I was preening myself in front of him. __EOS__ So I'm not too sure of what I look like. But two, two and a half percent, this means there are, what, six or eight million Americans with this often quite disabling and embarrassing problem which has really hardly yet introduced either to the public or the medical literature. ",0
52102," That's what I always say.__EOS__ And what I brought, what I brought to the table was so wonderful. I mean, it was automatically sexy, you know what I mean? So that never really entered, I want you to be sexy. How dare you ask me to be sexy? If I'm not giving you enough and what I'm doing then maybe you need to find somebody else to be sexy.__EOS__ But you know what I mean. Like with like - and there's a clip of this in the movie with Ike and Tina Turner.__EOS__ Yeah. Yeah.",2
52103," So what's next for you? You have a second season that's on now.__EOS__ And then we're doing season three. American's always asking me what's next, they always want to know what's next. I have a job, OK. I'm doing it.__EOS__ But who knows for how long?__EOS__ I have my own TV show. Everyone can just relax I'm doing another - they want to know, like, what else I'm doing. Calm down America. I have my own TV show. I'm 27 I have my own TV show. I'm doing all right. I've been doing season three. Season three's been commissioned, so we're doing that. I'm writing season three at the moment and that's everything that's all my time.",3
52104," What were you thinking when you wrote that song? __EOS__ When I wrote that song, I was thinking a lot about my mother, because I always felt - and I still feel like that she doesn't really believe enough in something strong, you know? Like, it could be God or it could be, you know - it's just the spirit. There is something missing, you know? She doesn't even believe in herself enough, that's what I think, because that's why she is in that condition, you know? __EOS__ Is she still struggling with addiction? __EOS__ Yes, yeah. My mom is still, she's still addicted, and she used to take methadone for many years, and, you know, then she stopped taking methadone again. Then she goes back to drugs and all that. And it's always like - you can't even say up and down, because methadone is even worse than heroin. It's just that the doctors, they can control it, you know? ",2
52105," Hi. Thank you for taking my call. __EOS__ Sure. Go ahead. __EOS__ My question is about how the professor feels the best way is to connect past history, ancient history to current day lives which is the work that I do here in Virginia in terms of our local Virginia American history. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. ",0
52106," I think so. __EOS__ They can sell out. __EOS__ You know that movie I kept referring to in getting ready for this movie was ""Breaking Away."" I think it's a great movie, and I remember riding my bike the next day. I think people all over America, they'll start wrestling when this movie comes out. It's going to be big. __EOS__ Big run on singlets. ",1
52107," But you're looking forward to - you're better economically off, so you can plan for these things if you're a little bit older. __EOS__ You can. But, you know, one of the interesting things is there's a group called Motherhood Later that gears themselves to women who have babies in their thirties and forties. They did a study, and they said that the number one thing that people who they surveyed said was that they don't have time for themselves. __EOS__ Hmm. __EOS__ So when you're older, maybe you become a little more selfish because you're used to being kind of the only game in town and taking care of yourself for so long and not having to worry about other people. And all of a sudden, you're being a caregiver for other people, you don't have necessarily that time for yourself for that manicure and pedicure. I know that you're getting one after the show. ",3
52108," Well, right off the bat, do not walk into the office without having a few bits of homework done. And we have this in the book in the first chapter. You need your health profile. What does that mean? Is there anybody in your family younger than the age of 65 who has died? And if so, what caused their death, because those are often genetic markers, warning signals to your doctor. Number two, are there any illnesses that tend to run in your family, whether they cause death or not? Share those. Third, are there vices? Don't be embarrassed. The one time where you should tell the truth is with your physician. __EOS__ You say confess your vices, here's a question from Nate on email. My insurance recently kicked in. I'm seeking treatment for a condition that I've had since before becoming insured. If I tell anybody about this my insurance could be void. If I don't I misinform my doctor. What do I do? __EOS__ We need religious scholars involved in that question. That's unfortunately an issue of honesty versus health and I'll always pick the health. It is possible that your insurance company may give you a hard time about it, but if you're going to risk your life to gain that benefit I think you're defeating the whole purpose of having insurance. __EOS__ Mehmet Oz is co-author of You the Smart Patient  An Insider's Handbook for Getting the Best Treatment. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. ",0
52109," Happy to be here. __EOS__ May I ask, sir, what did doctors tell you? __EOS__ Well, at first they told me that I had leukemia and they had to do some further analysis to see exactly what was what, and it came up as Ph-positive, chronic myeloid leukemia. __EOS__ And how did that go through you? ",3
52110," That's right. In health care, market forces don't bring prices down. We've seen that everything becomes more expensive every year  drugs, hospital stays. In other markets, the consumer has the power to bring prices down as producers compete with each because the consumer can say, you know, that laptop is a little expensive. I'm going to wait until a competitor, a rival, comes out with a less-expensive laptop that will meet my needs. __EOS__ So what kind of systemic change do you think we need to change this competitive relationship to a collaborative relationship? __EOS__ Recently, I attended a conference sponsored by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and Dartmouth, and at that conference, they looked at 10 communities where health care spending is low and quality of care is very high. And these are diverse communities, ranging from Sacramento to Tallahassee, Florida. __EOS__ Do you think that there are perverse incentives in the system right now? ",0
52111,"  There is. __EOS__  And often, when we see people in positions like yours, there is      a sense of pride.  But interestingly enough, a Democratic Maryland state      senator, Lisa Gladden, said a couple of weeks ago, `Party trumps race,      especially on the national level.  It's democracy perhaps at its worst,      but it's democracy.'  Do you buy that? __EOS__  Well, I don't buy that.  It's--that to me is an      ignorant statement.  And it's surprising coming from someone like Lisa      who is a student of history.  If she understands any of the underpinnings      of democracy, democracy does not tolerate the underbelly of politics.  It      doesn't tolerate the ugly side of politics.  That's what blacks had to go      through coming out of emancipation, you know, with segregation and Jim      Crow.  That's the ugly side of national politics, and I don't think      democracy tolerates that, nor is that something that I think we want      promoted in our state.  I think it--I find it hard to believe that if I,      as an African-American political elected official, had said about Lisa,      about Senator Verna Jones and delegate Selima Marriott, what they said      about me, that, trust me, this program would be very different in its      tone and its nature, as it would be around the country, because everyone      would rightly agree that it was racist, and they wouldn't tolerate it. __EOS__  I want to get to some of that because obviously this has      superceded, unfortunately, for you, some of the things that I'm sure you      want to talk about rather than dealing with this issue, but let me ask      you this.  In terms of just how black America may see black Republicans,      let's take you out of it and... ",3
52112," That's funny. __EOS__ It was horrible. __EOS__ You know, these bromance movies, where it's about the platonic relationship between two or more men… __EOS__ Sure. ",1
52113," Now, remember, I arrived at the fair that day not knowing if he'd stop to talk to us, so I didn't have this big list of questions ready. And he kept talking and he stood there, even though I kept expecting him to walk away. So after a while, I raised what I didn't realize at the time, but was kind of a sore spot. Country music was becoming more pop, less pure country.__EOS__ These days, a lot of country stars are starting to cross over into the national charts and have national hits.__EOS__ As you say, it seems that the record companies are trying for a ""crossover,"" quote, hit. That's not what country music is all about, to me. Generally, when I'm in charge of the production of my records, I try to record the best Johnny Cash song I can find, and do it in a way that's comfortable for me. And hopefully, the people will like it. And usually, they're unadorned and not overproduced...__EOS__ Well, now, five, six, seven minutes have passed. And I am out of questions. So I ask him ",2
52114," Yeah. __EOS__ One of the things I love about the film is that although the husband-father character in it, dash college teacher, doesn't connect with the rabbis he's talking with. At the end, and I don't want to give away the ending so I'm going to try to talk about this in such a way that I don't give away the ending. There is something truly... __EOS__ Surprise ending. __EOS__ Yeah, there's something truly awesome. And I don't mean like, wow, awesome. I mean, like that creates a feeling of overwhelming awe...

52115," Victor Wooten on bass, J.D. Blair on drums, both on the vocals there. We'll get some calls in a minute, but Victor Wooten, hasn't anybody ever told you, you can't play the bass like that? __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ Yes, I just don't listen too carefully. __EOS__ And when did you start  you obviously, to some degree, were self-taught, growing up with your brothers. ",0
52116," In both of the new novels, there is suspicion, betrayal and an uncle close at hand to offer help - and more - to his brother's widow. Shakespeare's work has long been adapted and even been set in the American Midwest before. Jane Smiley's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ""A Thousand Acres"" told the story of King Lear on a farm in Iowa. Author David Wroblewski based the fictional Sawtelle farm on his own childhood home. His mother trained dogs on their 90-acre farm in central Wisconsin. He describes his novel as simply a love story between a boy and his dog, and points to Rudyard Kipling's ""Mowgli Stories"" about a boy living in the wild as another major influence. He explains the book's likeness to ""Hamlet"" this way. __EOS__ I think of the relationship between Edgar's story and Hamlet's story as a refolded piece of origami. At one time, this was a perfectly-executed origami crane, and I unfolded it and refolded it into a different shape. And when it's in that different shape - say it's a frog, now - you can see a few feathers over here where no frog should have feathers. But it is primarily a frog. __EOS__ The big themes of ""Hamlet"" can withstand a lot of folding and refolding. Author Lin Enger. __EOS__ Vengeance versus justice, or vengeance versus forgiveness is probably the oldest moral dilemma that human beings face, and I think they can serve as a thematic impulse for stories set in any culture. ",0
52117," Well, of course. Now, do I get this right? Growing up in Philadelphia, you knew the great John Coltrane and Jimmy Heath? __EOS__ Oh, John and I were like blood brothers. I mean, I was 16 when I met him, and he was 18. And we spent our time in my living room listening to lots of 78 records, trying to figure out what was going on. And we had a beat-up piano in the corner, and I'd play after a fashion while he played. And he played worse than I did, for me. We really annoyed the neighbors. We were on the front room and it was the summertime. __EOS__ I see, this is hilarious. You annoyed the neighbors. But I wonder what the neighbors would think if, you know, Benny Golson and John Coltrane... __EOS__ ...were playing next door. ",2
52118,"  But you and Ray kept the money. __EOS__  This whole  is Ray's fault. __EOS__  Where's the money now, Helene? __EOS__  It's with Ray. ",1
52119," That's just - you know what I mean, but that's like a theatrical expression of contempt. And that opened my eyes as a kid that you could actually be - well, you could be wrong in character. You could be blasphemous in character, and it doesn't negate how you feel about the subject. You know, like...__EOS__ Oh, so...__EOS__ The greatest example is just because I play a murderer doesn't mean I'm a murderer. In the same way, you could actually mock Christ in this song, effectively mock Christ, and, you know, comedically mock Christ, and yet it's not a mockery of the story.__EOS__ Wow, that's kind of like you were seven and figured out what it means to be in character, which you now are so much of the time on your show. It's like this is the roots...",2
52120," Now, first, they're not paying attention, then they're staring...__EOS__ But thanks very much. I love your work.__EOS__ Thanks very much for the call.__EOS__ Thanks. It's funny about the gestures, you know, that there are some conductors - and you see some 95-year-old conductors. That's one of the reasons why I want to get into conducting more because I think you live longer. So you see a 95-year-old conductor who doesn't have the flexibility and the strength to move around a lot, and yet they can show with a small gesture a kind of power that an orchestra can feel, and they can get this amazing sound out of an orchestra without huge gestures. And so it's an amazing thing what the conductor's role is. It's something sort of magical about it that when it works, it's something really amazing.",2
52121," I mean, that - his name is John Wright and he's the single father of two and he really felt like getting one of these birds was a way of sort of connecting his whole family in a way that maybe he doesn't have in a life partner right now. __EOS__ And Daniel, the pet shop owner, decided he was OK, put him - ran him through the gauntlet? __EOS__ He decided it was OK and went to his house, checked out his layout, met his kids. __EOS__ To his house? ",3
52122," Sure.__EOS__ This was directed by Jay Roach. I think the...__EOS__ The wonderful Jay Roach, yeah, marvelous director.__EOS__ Right, the screenplay Danny Strong, who did ""Recount,"" the story of the Florida recount from the 2000 election. And it's based of course...",1
52123," Right.__EOS__ So we were always making them aware of that. Also, as we met subjects, we immediately wanted to talk with their family members and parents to get permission, so that their families knew that we were wanting to this and if it was okay for them that we were filming their children.__EOS__ Rebecca Cammisa, director of ""Which Way Home,"" nominated - one of five films nominated for this year's best documentary feature. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.__EOS__ Is the director familiar with the book ""The Tunnel Kids,"" which chronicled the lives of children who led migrants in the tunnels between Mexico and Arizona? Please thank her for bringing this troubling issue to the screen. It's sobering, very important as we discuss the immigration problem without understanding the motives and challenges of immigrants.",1
52124," The now 60-something Cash sits in a 21st century London cafe and shakes his head at the idea that he and his colleagues were heard by as many as 20 million rock-deprived Brits - nearly half the population. __EOS__ It was bizarre because you had no real idea until you came ashore and there'd be 3,000 people waiting for us. We were treated like pop stars, and of course, being young and single, we took advantage of that. __EOS__ At sea it was another matter. The acoustics on the steel ships werent great. The onboard regimen was monastic - strictly no women allowed - and then there was the weather. __EOS__ This is Radio Caroline. ",1
52125,"  Ever since you left me, I've done nothing but wrong. Many nights I've laid awake and cried. We once were happy, my heart was in a whirl, but now I'm a honky tonk girl. __EOS__  So turn that Jukebox way up high, and fill my glass up while I cry. I've lost everything in this world, and now I'm a honky tonk girl. __EOS__ So we heard Loretta Lynn singing her song ""I'm a Honky Tonk Girl,"" and then Lee Ann Womack from the new Loretta Lynn tribute, ""Coal Miner's Daughter."" __EOS__ Thank you, Terry. It's really nice to be on your show. ",2
52126,  What do you want? Did something happen to dad? __EOS__  No. __EOS__  Then what do you want? __EOS__  Did you have a fire here last night? ,1
52127,"  ...because I've been to the mountain top. __EOS__  And I don't mind. __EOS__  Like anybody, I would like to live a long life.  Longevity has      its place.  But I'm not concerned about that now.  I just want to do      God's will. And he's allowed me to go up to the mountain, and I've looked      over and I've seen the promised land. __EOS__  I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight      that we as a people will get to the promised land.

52128," Oh, my goodness. Do you have a favorite term you learned? __EOS__ Yes! I really love the term Making the Castle. And what that means is you made it to Nationals, because the stage they performed on is actually physically shaped like a castle, with turrets and stonework. It's all very exciting. __EOS__ It's a really great read, by Kate Torgovnick. I can't get your name. I practiced that even. The book is called ""Cheer! Three Teams on a Quest for College Cheerleading's Ultimate Prize."" I know you're reading at a Borders in Columbus Circle in New York today. We'll link to your website because I know you do readings across the country. Good luck with the book! __EOS__ Thank you!  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0
52129," So getting to the exchanges, in the House bill, it's a national insurance exchange. In the Senate bill, it's state-oriented. Would you explain the difference between the two bills? __EOS__ Absolutely, and this is a very important difference that frankly has gotten little attention. It's not a hot-button issue like abortion or the public option. __EOS__ Now, how does a state system, as opposed to a national system, affect the ability of the health care lobby to influence the packages that are being offered? __EOS__ An excellent question, and you'll get different answers, depending on who you ask about this. My impression has always been that the health care industry tends to be - has more power relatively speaking at the state level, particularly again when you're talking about something like the hospitals.

52130," I think slow movements, especially, parts of the sonatas which change the most in a given moment, on a given evening. Like for example slow movement of  454. __EOS__ Tell us about this. __EOS__ So that's, you know, that's the theme introduced by the violin. And Lambert's is hanging in there waiting for his time to come. __EOS__ But there's small spacing things, which change from night to night. It's not quite metronomic. ",2

52132," And for most of your career, you've worked in small groups. Why now a symphony orchestra? __EOS__ Well, I've worked with symphony orchestras before, you know, but one-offs, say, at the Grammys or the Oscars... __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ ...but just for one song or two. And then last May, I was asked by the Chicago Symphony to put together an hour's program of my own music for their orchestra. It was a benefit concert. And I accepted because I like a challenge. And - but my intention was to ask the orchestra to play in a very rhythmic manner rather than just be sawing whole notes behind a pop ballad. I was going to ask them to do something a little more challenging because I think they'd enjoy it better. ",2
52133," That's an interesting question. Firstly, it was very clear what I was saying. So everyone was, you know, clearly heard throw the Jew down the well, and they were singing along, and I sang it a number of times. __EOS__ Does it reveal their anti-Semitism? You know, was everyone in the bar anti-Semitic? And I think, you know, there's a historian - not to bring it down and to depress everyone - but there was a historian of the Holocaust and of Nazi Germany called Ian Kershaw. He said quite an interesting thing, which was that the path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference. __EOS__ But there's a debate, a very lively debate, going on right now because of your work, about whether this kind of comedy actually feeds anti-Semitism and hatred or mocks it in a way that shows how stupid and pointless it is. __EOS__ Oh no, I do, I do...

52134,"  Now last night we served this. Miserable, overcooked asparagus. In this restaurant the cuisine is not old tired marriage. It is a passionate affair of the heart.__EOS__ And Helen Mirren joins me now from New York. Welcome to the program.__EOS__ Thank you, I'm so excited to be here. I listen to your program all the time.

He is also known for his novel ""Clockers,"" he's one of the writers for ""The Wire"" and has written many other novels. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ They're going to know your work, and you might be, like, a real hero to them in that respect. So, has it changed the relationship that you have with cops now? __EOS__ No - I just want to say this one thing about myself and cops. I mean, I'm not, like, into cops, you know. It's like - I'm not a buff, I'm not - you know, my politics are certainly not law and order. I'll hang out with anybody who'll have me. What I find when I'm with cops is you just see the world in a way that you would never see on your own. You can - you walk around the Lower East Side, you see what you see, you see what makes it into Time Out magazine. You see this and that. ",0
52137," Child Protective Services.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ Social workers.__EOS__ They came to visit the home. And in the week between my telling the school about the abuse of my doll and when the social worker actually came to visit the home, there was a mad dash to clean the home for fear that I'd be taken away from them. Then I realized that something was really wrong with the way we were living. And after that, I promised that I would never tell anyone about my dad.",0
52138," When I started thinking about myself as a writer, the work I did was almost exclusively devoted to the short story. I think many writers in those years started with a story - the American short story is such a classic form. And I wrote a number of stories and managed to get a couple published in literary magazines. And at a certain point, I decided to take a leap, the existential leap into the novel, and that took - it took me a long time to write my first novel. When I finished, I stayed with the novel for a time, through the 1970s. At the end of the '70s, I wrote the first short story I've done in quite a long time, and that turns out to be the first story in this book called ""Creation."" And then occasional stories subsequently.__EOS__ There are many characters in this book who are alone, or at least isolated, and you mentioned ""Creation."" In that story, you have a couple struggling to get a plane ride off of a tropical island. In another story, there's a woman who visits art museums alone, and then she meets a man who does the same thing. There's another story about two men in a space capsule orbiting Earth during World War III. I can't imagine being more isolated than that.__EOS__ Well, it's a subject in part because a writer spends so much of his or her time in - alone in a room. But beyond that, I think it's so suitable for the short story form. And so one or two characters are usually quite sufficient for the demands of a particular idea that will find itself in abbreviated form.__EOS__ When you look at a book like ""Underworld,"" a huge book, sweeping book, and, of course, you look at these nine stories, I wonder about the difference in the challenges. I mean, writing a huge book versus writing a small sort of flash of a moment in time. Is one more difficult than the other, or are they just different kinds of challenges?",0
52139," Lauren Young, Kay - she - it's certainly up to her, and she's got a point. She's had the experience and she wants her own child. __EOS__ And it's possible to do that. There was a woman who was 57 years old who gave birth to twins a couple of years ago in New York City with a donated egg. It's totally scientifically possible. And I don't think I could do it, but who am I to judge if someone else can? Science is letting us to do it. It's just - the implication, though, is what happens if you're in your fifties, in 20 years from now, when that kid does graduate from college and - are they going to be your caregiver? What's their role going to be in the world? And I think sometimes people - it's very hard to see out into the future and think about what the impact is for a child who may not have the support of their parents for much of their life. __EOS__ But Kay, obviously you've been through with the adopted kids and you certainly know what you're getting yourself in for. __EOS__ Exactly. But in our town, the major medical centers will not let us, I think, because we're too old. ",3
52140," It's possible, but the one thing I've noticed with the Iranians over the years is - particularly the Revolutionary Guard. They tend to respond - they're very cautious by nature. They push till they find weakness, and then they try to exploit it. But when they meet resistance - particularly by the U.S. military, that they know is much more powerful than they are, they usually back off.__EOS__ My guest is David Crist, author of the new book ""The Twilight War  The Secret History of America's Thirty-Year Conflict with Iran.""

But after 9/11, Iran makes it quite clear that they would like to work with the U.S. in Afghanistan. The Taliban were hated by the Iranians. They had killed a number of Iranian diplomats a few years earlier. That nearly led to a war between Iran and Afghanistan. So they had no love for the Taliban, either.",0
52141," This is Christina Binkley, style columnist for The Wall Street Journal. I'm speaking with her and also Claire Sulmers, founder of The Fashion Bomb, a daily destination for the urban fashionista. And we're talking about the growing influence of style bloggers. __EOS__ I think I have kind of a very close relationship with the consumers and the buyers. A lot of the people that I speak to on my blog and who visit my blog are people who wouldn't call themselves fashion people, per se, who need a lot of guidance and they need to know what to wear to the baby shower. They need to know what to wear for their birthday. They need to know what to wear for everything. And I think I may seem - or I am more accessible to them then an editor would be. I'm their friend. I'm their friend, who happens to know a little bit more about fashion than they do, and I'm there to help them along the way. __EOS__ You know what questions I have, is this whole question of pay to play in this industry. I mean, it is known, of course, that fashion magazines get presents from people. People who work at magazines, they get stuff. And the issue did arise in the blogging world about a year ago about this whole question of whether bloggers really can be trusted as an objective and independent voice, when so many people are kind of out there on a shoestring, when you have to assume that the salaries are not large and probably are very motivated to get free stuff and possibly to shape their coverage accordingly. __EOS__ I do accept some gifts, and I always disclose what I receive. I'll wear it. I'll say this is gifted by so-and-so. Or if someone wants to put an advertisement up, I'll say this is an advertisement. But bottom line, I'm very objective, and I would never promote something that I don't believe in because I do think it's important just in terms of trust with my readership that I'm honest with them.

52142," We enforce over discrimination against students based on race, color and national origin under Title XI of the Civil Rights Act, based on sex under Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act, and based on disability under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. That said, much of the bullying and harassment directed toward students that are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender is in fact not because of their sexual orientation. It's because they are not conforming to what some hold as traditional gender stereotypes. __EOS__ Let me just play a short clip of a student who graduated from a school near Minneapolis last year. And the language, I have to say, is strong. So some who are listening might not consider it appropriate for everybody who is listening at the moment. But the teen's name is Justin Anderson. The clip was featured in a story on NPR earlier this week where he was describing the kind of behavior that I think this letter is directed towards. So, let's play it. __EOS__ I mean, Im hearing people say things like, fags should just disappear so we don't have to deal with them anymore. And fags are disgusting and sinful. And, still, there's nobody intervening. And I began to feel so worthless and ashamed and unloved that I began to think about taking my life. __EOS__ And obviously any reasonable person would think, nobody should go to school feeling this way. But the other side of this question for some people is that this directive bumps up against the free speech rights of persons who may have religious beliefs about same sex relationships. And that the department is stacking the deck in a way so that persons who have a particular religious orientation are now silenced in expressing that. Has this question come up? I think it probably has. ",3

We like to think of ""The ArchAndroid"" as an emotion picture for the mind. I do believe that it will transform you. You won't know it. You'll have to listen to it maybe a couple times, but I think that it just prepares your palette for just more diverse music. __EOS__ You talk about this music transforming people.

Wendy Ruderman and Barbara Laker are the authors. I caught up with them when they were in Washington, D.C. for a book signing. And before we begin, I should mention that this conversation contains details and language that some might find disturbing. That said, I started by asking Wendy Ruderman about Benny Martinez, the police informant who got the story started.__EOS__ Benny Martinez had been a drug informant for seven years, which is an incredibly long time. And what was happening was he was working with this one officer, Jeff Cujdik, and Jeff Cujdik had some real estate. So Jeff was renting him a house. In Philadelphia, being a drug informant is actually a job. You get paid for every door knock you do in which drugs are exchanged. You get a $100 if a gun is found. So the money that he was making was flowing back to the police officer in the way of rent.__EOS__ Why did Benny come to you?__EOS__ Benny was looking for some protection. He was fearful of his life. He was afraid that either the police officer wanted him dead or the drug dealers on the streets wanted him dead because what had happened was he and Jeff Cujdik set up a big-time drug dealer who had enough resources to hire a very high-powered attorney, who - that attorney then hired a private investigator and suspected that Benny had set him up - so basically, had Benny followed around by the private investigator who took pictures of Benny coming out of Jeff's house and establishing that they had this relationship that crossed the line.",3
52146," So I said, well, maybe I'll go look around. __EOS__ Okay. So let's start with England. You took your shoulder to England... __EOS__ ...and what was the advice you got there? __EOS__ In Britain that's, you know, where they invented the stiff upper lip, and to be blunt about it, my GP in Britain said live with it. It's not destroying my life that much. I got another hand that I can reach up and change lightbulbs with, you know. So he said I could send you to the orthopedic surgeon, he'd look at it, he'd say, no, not serious enough. We're not going to do the operation and you could come back to me, we could send you to another surgeon, he'd say no. He says I'll tell you what, the NHS, the National Health Service, we'll give you physio - that's physical therapy, and that'll help some. That'll reduce some pain but go home and live with it. That's the advice he gave me. ",0

She died when I was just a baby, a freak accident during a routine liposuction.__EOS__ The performances were so kind of fresh, and the timing and everything was so great from each person that I think that would last a very long time.__EOS__  I don't care what my teachers say.

52154," Hi, Melissa. Good to be here. __EOS__ And let's start with some  news from AT&T this week. This has to with iPhone users and the enabling of multimedia messaging services for iPhones. What does that mean, Omar? __EOS__ Well, an MMS message is basically a text message with a photo or a video attached. Previously, you could send text messages on the iPhone, but not with an image or a video. You had to send that as an email or in some other way. So this is a feature that's been missing from the iPhone and is pretty commonly available on most cell phones. So, it's been a pretty big gripe for iPhone users to not have that feature. And AT&T finally enabled that on Friday with a software update. __EOS__ So, how big a deal is that? ",3

I think we try to stay away from the personal stuff. We try to back up our opinions with facts. So, yeah. I mean, you can accuse me of anything you want, but, you know, I'm trying to do the right thing.  __EOS__ What do you think when you hear people complain about the quality, not just in the media, but of political discourse today, that it's departed from reality, for example?  __EOS__ Well, I mean, if it's departed from reality, then we have to isolate the people who are doing that. President Obama was right in his Arizona speech, that he said, look, you know, you can't enflame to the point where you hate each other. That's not what America is supposed to be. But what can he do? I don't see him, his rhetoric, he doesn't do that. I don't see personal attacks coming from Mr. Obama.  ",0

I mean, how then do you deal with things like Social Security, Medicare, and beyond just taking care of this population? __EOS__ Well, this is the explosive part of it.

52164," Well, my brother was a barber so I, you know, grew up around barbershops. And I always saw these characters and different stories through these people just coming in and out. You know, whether it was that guy who was selling DVDs or watches from his coat pocket or whether it was the barber himself. You know, it just felt like a place that had a natural canvas of story and character and all the things that I think make a good film.__EOS__ How on earth, though, did you get the idea of four barbers, three continents?__EOS__ In truth, it came to me out of frustration. You know, I was watching a lot of programs, and I visit a lot of film festivals, and I watch films all the time. And I'd rarely seen anything that had just documented, you know, the black male perspective, totally sort of positive and unadulterated way. And I looked at what spaces within our communities actually offered a vehicle into that world, and the barbershop was actually the only place that had, for me, all the ingredients that would make something that I felt would be quite an open ticket - an open door for people who weren't part of that community to actually see different lifestyles. So it really came out of that.__EOS__ The film opens with a proverb. It says even the high and noble bow before the barber. And the thing that's - the point that you make in the film that I'm not sure people who have not experienced a black barbershop understand is that is really true. I mean, you will find everybody in a barbershop. You will find a - how shall we say - somebody in the off-the-books pharmaceutical trade...",1

52167," No, I did not. To me, it was a stepping stone to Broadway. I still - you know, and at the time, I was in a show called ""Once Upon a Mattress"" Off-Broadway, and so I was doubling.

It was like ""Star Search"" only not - you know, it was ""Reach for the Stars,"" or some kind of a show like that. And the emcee came out, and he said you're very good, dear, but you're too loud for TV.__EOS__ So that was, you know, again, somebody said that, so I accepted it. And when Garry hired me, I was kind of surprised, you know. So I just kind of thought no, I'm a belter and I'm a comic, and I belong on the stage.

52169," What about acting in high school?__EOS__ Yeah. I was real involved in the theater program in high school, and I was in a lot of musical theater. And that's, I guess, where my music and my acting started to mix.__EOS__ So what was your favorite role that you played in a musical?__EOS__ Well, it's got to be ""Pippin."" That was my best one. But we also did a production of a Bertolt Brecht play called ""The Caucasian Chalk Circle."" And I played Azdak, the kind of anarchistic judge in a land that was sort of in turmoil. That was a kind of a heavy play to do in high school. It was pretty advanced.",1
52170," Obviously, you've got to choose his school up to...__EOS__ Oh sure.__EOS__ ...14. Well, I've worked out - I would never send him to a public school because just of the snob value, that he'd be snobbish to people that didn't go. But the people there would also be snobbish to him because of what I am. So I'm not going to let him go through that. If I send them to an ordinary school, just an ordinary day school or a grammar school, if he was at the grammar school, his father would be that much richer than most of the people there that he's bound to get, you know, some...__EOS__ Difficulty. Yeah. Yes.",2
52171," ...critical to understanding them, do you think?__EOS__ That's very, very true. You know, I never saw or heard my father pray.

52172," So, you know, there's the kind of basic itch you get - a mosquito bite, you get a rash, poison ivy. It itches for a while. It goes away. You can treat it and numb it when it's at its worst. But, you know, it's going to go away. But chronic itch doesn't go away. And it's very disturbing to the people who have it - interferes with sleep, interferes with other things as well. It's kind of itch gone berserk. So is the problem neurological? Like, is there something happening with the nervous system when you have that kind of chronic itch?__EOS__ That's an excellent question. And indeed, the neural system is significantly involved. It transmits the itch signals from the skin, where itch emanates, up into the spinal cord and up to the brain. The nerves are acting wacky. They fire when these patients have chronic itch, and we become very sensitive. So even small activities or very minimal activities that usually would not cause us itch like changing our clothes or changes in temperature and environment or exposure to soaps, could irritate this system and the patient feels more itch.__EOS__ So if we look at chronic pain and chronic itch, how are they similar? How are they different?__EOS__ Well, both of them are unpleasant sensations. There's some unique difference and one of the unique differences is that, in pain we retract from the area where we have a painful stimuli. While itch, we actually scratch it. We induce bit of pain to relieve it.",3
52173," No misdemeanors out there.__EOS__ But, you know, he was arrested for burglary. Burglary is barely a crime in New York. You can't - you know.

52175," Oh, I don't think there's any question. Yeah, I think you're absolutely right.__EOS__ But what does it say to you about TV versus movies?__EOS__ Well, you know, this is something I've talked about over the past couple of years, which is the sort of migration of a particular kind of audience from movies to television. And at a certain level it's not surprising to me at all that we ended up at HBO because I've seen a drift over the last decade or so and it's partially I think as a result of the fact that there's just so much great television being made, and a lot of this is I think due to ""The Sopranos,"" which kind of altered the landscape in a way that is still evolving. But I think everything that's good now is sort of standing on the shoulders of what David Chase did and it just completely changed people's attitudes about TV and, you know, here we are where I look at it and, you know, it feels like a sort of second golden age of television. There's really, really good stuff being made.__EOS__ My guest is Steven Soderbergh. He directed the new movie ""Behind the Candelabra,"" which premieres on HBO Sunday night. More after break.",1
52176," Do all the cheeses have the basic, same recipe today? __EOS__ I mean all cheese has the basic same recipe, so it's really just tweaks on a few simple steps and you wind up with completely different things. __EOS__ Mm-hmm.

52177,"  In the film, we see parents who frankly don't want their children going to war. And it's the parents that are concerned about their kids dying.  It's understandable.  In fact, there's a point in the film where you're talking to a recruit named Chris about his stepfather and his stepfather's misgivings about him enlisting.  Let's listen to that. __EOS__  Your stepfather, no disrespect to you, it's my personal opinion, is an armchair quarterback.  I will not be questioned by a guy that sits on his couch all day.  I'm not going to argue with the stupid.  I don't care if he's your dad.  I'm going to call an ace of spade an ace of spades.  I'm going to tell you you're right or you're wrong, because guess what? I'm like your dad now, and I will not tolerate it. __EOS__  Sergeant, that seems a little harsh. __EOS__  You know, I'm not exactly sure how the tone of that conversation went, but I think that that is also little misleading in the film. And I've discussed that with the filmmaker in detail, as well.  It's kind of a loose term to call him a stepfather because his mother's husband was only in his life for maybe six months.   ",3
52178," I was doing an off-Broadway play called ""The Days and Nights of Beebee Fenstermaker,"" a wonderful play by William Hartwell Snyder that just was terrific. And I played a guy from Hughes, Arkansas. So I was flying back from California to New York and I got off the plane in Memphis. I said, let me go to Hughes, just to see what it's like. Not that you have to do that to be an actor, but I decided. __EOS__ Right. And, of course, this isn't just about Pentecostal culture. It's about a truly fascinating character, I mean, your guy. __EOS__ Yes. I pieced it together from many, many, many stories. __EOS__ Yeah. ",1
52179," Right. __EOS__ �he nails it. __EOS__ Yeah. ""Running Scared."" There's so many of them like that. __EOS__ So, did you mic him differently? Or, you know, was he miked differently because he gets such big notes, but as you're saying, it's not like he's shouting them? ",2
52180," Exactly. __EOS__ The meeting, as you report, ended at 4 p.m. - around 4 p.m. And by 6 30 p.m., all the sheets and the paperwork had been turned in and signed by all of these CEOs. It's unusual for government to move that swiftly. __EOS__ Yeah. I mean, maybe this is because it's Mr. Paulson, and he's used to getting things done quickly. When he was at Goldman Sachs, you know, he was sort of known for wanting everything done yesterday. But there's just no time to waste. I mean, I've never seen people at Treasury so nervous as they have been in the last few weeks. They really have no idea where the bottom is, and they don't know what's going to turn it around.  __EOS__ Deborah Solomon, good to talk to you. Thanks so much. ",3
52181," A lot of the things he has said since my release have been either incomplete or untrue. I don't know why it is — maybe they believe whatever the court has told them or maybe it's because they live and work in Iran and they have to be careful of their relations with the authorities. In Iran, there have been attorneys who have been jailed for representing clients with sensitive cases such as mine. He may have been referring to the false confession I made but my confession was false and I thought I had to fabricate it to save myself. __EOS__ So the name, I mean, there's a fair amount of specificity in what he is saying here, this name, Mr. Peterson, invented out of whole cloth? Was this part of the government evidence and you're now saying it's absolutely not true? __EOS__ I don't really want to say any more about this person because it was completely false and I recanted it before my first trial. __EOS__ You were in captivity, held in Iran for 100 days. Tell me about those days in Evin prison. What filled your time, what you thought about, what kept you going? ",3
52182," The setup, as we were introduced to the story, was these people were on opposing sides. You know, Mark was the villain, Matt was the, you know, the guy trying to bring justice to the world. And I think you know, over time we learned that while they may have opposing roles, they shared an obsession.__EOS__ An obsession for art. In the documentary when the two finally meet, Mark Landis asks Matt Leininger, did I get the colors right?__EOS__ Feeding his desire for acceptance and friendship and camaraderie, and simply to be liked and respected.__EOS__ Earlier this month Colette Loll, the filmmakers and Mark Landis attended a screening of the documentary ""Art And Craft"" at a conference for mental health professionals and families affected by mental illness. When it was over, Landis received a standing ovation.",1
52183,"  Can I ask, Mr. Schorr, did you--I spent a lot of time with      Joe Wershba... __EOS__  Mm-hmm. __EOS__  ...and Milo Radulovich and Don Hewitt, and they all      referred to him as Mr. Murrow. __EOS__  Yes. ",3
52184," I think that's why people were so transfixed by this case. There was really two things going on. One is the idea that Maria Marten could disappear and no one would even really know it. And in fact, you'd actually - she was actually buried on her own property. And her parents and sister were walking right by her and didn't even know. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And I think people who saw this case saw Maria Marten and they saw Mary Moore and they thought, you know, that could have been me. __EOS__ Help us appreciate how much James Curtis involved himself in the case, both with Maria Marten's family and then the extraordinary closeness that he sort of struck up with William Corder. ",0
52185,"  What changed about it after it left your hands? __EOS__  They remixed it and made some embarrassing, crucial mistakes      in the mix.  I had put some guitar parts on to show B.B. the section that      I wanted him to play in and they put my guitar parts on the record. __EOS__  Your own guitar? __EOS__  Yeah, which was never my intention. ",2
52186," In this aria that we're hearing, you are performing as Satan. You couldn't have picked a better place to start. And of course, opera composers have often relied on some really depraved characters to tell their stories. How important is evil to most operas? __EOS__ Well, this is a wonderful example of such an aria. Mefistofele, you know, there is that wonderful saying  One who sups with the devil had better use a long spoon. And this is called, well, it's surtitled the ""Ballata del fischio,"" where the devil himself says he likes a world of nothing and of total destruction. __EOS__ Why are so many bad boy roles written for baritone singers like you? I mean, what is it that you can do that tenors can't? __EOS__ I don't know. It could be something to do with the color of the voice, the dark bass-baritone repertoire, even sometimes into the bass repertoire. So I think composers perhaps tended to go for the basses as being those misfits on the stage, whereas the tenor always had the romantic role. ",2
52187," Of some sort and build, what, off-ramps, highway off-ramps and septic tanks. __EOS__ And you have some great moments of physical comedy in it. You take a lot of physical abuse in this movie. __EOS__ Yeah, yeah. As far as the physical abuse, you know, I had a feeling going into the movie that there would be some injuries, just because, you know, I had been on, like the Spiderman movies that, you know, have very big budgets. I think ""Spiderman 3"" had one of the biggest budgets ever, and you take a lot of time to do those action scenes. __EOS__ And so, and you know, it was kind of I guess my fault, but you know, the guy - whatever. And then Seth, like, I think sprained his finger. He had to go to the hospital for his finger. There's a scene where I hit Danny over the head with a bong, and yeah, it was a breakaway bong, but by that point - I mean, I even warned Danny McBride. ",3
52188," Yes, I think that Michelle Obama was - at least in the eyes of many black people - a great validator. So there were some blacks who, you know, were a little bit skeptical about Barack Obama, given his upbringing. But then, you know, he has on his arm Michelle Obama, and I think that assuaged a lot of anxiety felt by some black people. __EOS__ Let's hear from Travis in Shasta, California. Travis, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. Travis, you're on the air. Welcome to the show. __EOS__ I'm sorry. I spent the last 10 years married to a black woman, and I'm a white man. And just the whole thing I go through at work is - I work with a lot of men that are, say, 50 or so to 25, and the way the N-word is tossed around, I just - and then I have to go through and tell them that my wife is black and I'd like not to, you know, hear that. So I've been through that a lot. And just - the other point is just, I think - I wish America would get over that Barack's black. And judging him on what he's done, and not that he is a black president, would be nice. __EOS__ And Travis, do you think if you said to your co-workers, I don't like that language, without backing it up of, my wife is black, that it would have the same impact?

I just knew he was perfect for me, and he was. __EOS__ Perfect in what way? __EOS__ Perfect in every - smart, funny, terrific, got the business, got me, had a great time together, both wanted the same things. We had a great marriage, a great marriage. Was I madly in love with him, thumpy, thumpy, thumpy, thumpy, thumpy? No. But as my mother always said  They should like you more than you like them. They worry where you are. Don't you have to worry so much where he is. __EOS__ So was he thumpy-thumpy over you? Is that what you're saying? ",1
52190," My guest is Rom Ricks, the former military correspondent for the Washington Post and the author of the bestseller ""Fiasco,"" about the invasion and occupation of Iraq. His latest book, ""The Gamble  General Petraeus and the American Military Adventure in Iraq,"" has just been published in paperback. When we left off, we were talking about the elections in Iraq, which are scheduled for March 7th. __EOS__ Yeah, American intelligence people call him Mookie, Muqtada al-Sadr. __EOS__ Great. __EOS__ He's kind of the Al Sharpton of Iraq. Sadr City, this big slum on the east side of Baghdad has four million people, so one out of every six or seven Iraqis lives in that neighborhood. One out of six or seven people not just of Baghdad but of the whole country. ",0
52191," You mean they were - now listen, I want you to hear what I'm saying. __EOS__ Okay. __EOS__ They were taught so well that they can remember what they did then and do it? __EOS__ It's almost like you were in the room, Prof. ",1
52192," And that's something I deal with in the book throughout is this idea of the violence as a solution to anything. But we shouldn't gloss over the very real challenges that Pakistan and America have had, especially in the last decade, since the war in Afghanistan started. The one country in the world that hates the United States most in public polls is Pakistan. And the one country in the world that Americans hate - well, Pakistan was tied with Iran. And so these are two countries where the populace have come, you know, to become very suspicious of each other, of the other, and yet the two countries remain, quote ""closely allied"" in the war.__EOS__ So we're, again, at one of these fatefully important crossroads in America and Pakistani relations. Looking down the road after the withdrawal from Afghanistan is complete, where do America and Pakistan go from here?__EOS__ Well, I think that's a very important question, a very relevant question. The answer, short answer is nowhere, whether the - Pakistan and the United States remain right where they are, which is, like I said, tied in their geography and history. We've really been focused on the Pakistan's western border for a decade and more now - Afghanistan and Iran. These are two countries that obviously are very relevant to American foreign policy. I think the focus is going to turn more onto Pakistan's eastern border.__EOS__ Shahan Mufti is a Pakistani-American journalist and writer. His new book is ""The Faithful Scribe  A Story of Islam, Pakistan, Family and War."" Shahan, thank you so much.",0
52193," We wanted to show our new truck really is going to separate itself from the herd, but still it's just like a cowboy needs a really dependable horse, and they got a lot of publicity out of it as well.  __EOS__ Let me ask you, how much can you push this pickup truck knowing, as you know better than anybody, oil's hitting $100 a barrel, the U.S. pickup truck sales generally are down, trends pointing away from gas-guzzling vehicles to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars? __EOS__ You have to have a full portfolio of products, from small, very fuel-efficient vehicles, all the way up to large trucks that people use in their work. The full-size truck market, the SUV market, is still the largest single market of automotives sold in North America. And it's gotten more competitive. __EOS__ Are these big pickups all about people who need them for business - contractors, farmers? I mean, how much of the pickup truck market is actually city people, teenagers, women with kids? ",3
52194," Yes, it is. I mean, there are rare opportunities for the amateur to contribute. It is - has become possible in recent years with the advent of personal computers. That is, people have discovered interesting things in computers that professional mathematicians hadn't seen, and occasionally an amateur mathematician or a beginner will think of some very ingenious proof or solution to some old problem. But it is true that it's very, very unusual. __EOS__ Okay. Well, I commend people to your column and to your book, and I hope we can continue the discussion about math. I still, sort of, feel like I'm knocking on the outdoors, outside of an interesting world that I can't quite see into. But maybe that'll change as the columns appear.

52195," Well, Wingnut, he was a warrior, an eco-warrior, and I met him in Seattle in late 1999 during the World Trade Organization protests that paralyzed the city. And Wingnut was, if you will, a sort of leader of the anarchists. __EOS__ He is a disciple of the Unabomber, and he calls pacifist protestors peace Nazis. __EOS__ Yeah. Well, this story was a real revelation for me because it was the first story I had worked on that was a media story. I had pitched this story to Rolling Stone, way before the protests occurred, and there was going to be tens of thousands of peaceful protestors that had organized. They were going to wear costumes, march through the streets. __EOS__ They were going to be owls and turtles, you said in your… ",0
52196," I think that's a good comment. At the first, it was parents concerned that, you know, the investigation wasn't transpiring and making sure that, you know, it wasn't just going to be swept under the carpet. So I think that's a fair statement.__EOS__ But do you feel that now it really has become polarized along racial lines? Or do you still feel that perhaps that oversimplifies the case where you are?__EOS__ I think it oversimplifies it a little bit. You know, it's almost like the bell curve. It started out as, you know, upset parents and upset community, you know, as here's a young man that's been, has been killed, you know, saying that he's murdered and the shooter hasn't been put away or hasn't - isn't going - doesn't look like he's going to go to a jury of his peers. And then it took on this whole racial overtone. But you know, as we sit right now in the city of Sanford, it's almost more of, this is what the demonstrations were for. We wanted him to sit in front of a jury of his peers and that's what's transpired. I think it's opened up a whole lot of dialogue across the nation for race relations though. It's almost, as we talk, it's almost that there was that, you know, festering wound underneath the scab and this kind of pulled that scab off the top and let a lot of thoughts and history come out as to, you know, race relations, relations between the community and police departments, not just in Sanford, but in a lot of small and medium-sized communities around the nation.__EOS__ I wanted to ask you about that. Is there something that you've learned or heard in the course of this that you just didn't know before, even though this is your town?",3
52197," That has such a sort of '50s kind of feel to it at moments. Is that conscious at all? __EOS__ A little bit. I think we all felt the same way when we started playing it and maybe we ran with it a little bit. __EOS__ Well, I mean, I was listening to it and I thought, you know, you can almost see kids dancing at a sock hop to that song at certain moments, you know. __EOS__  Everybody sees and everyone agrees that you and I are wrong and it's been that way too long...

52198," Yes. They present the symptoms of conditions and so on.__EOS__ She is 55 years old. She's a widow. And she actually gets quite into this role-playing. One day, she's a transvestite with knee trouble. The next day, she's someone's mother who has gone into a coma. Eventually, some of the medical students become borders. They come to live with her at her home. She needs the extra income. And soon enough, they can no longer pay the rent, so she cuts a deal with them, a very interesting deal.__EOS__ Well, they then say we're used to watching you perform symptoms and so on. If we could, instead of paying the rent, which we can't do, if we could perform for you, and she doesn't immediately understand what this involves. And then she realizes, oh, you brought oral - the reader realizes when you actually get into the bedroom.__EOS__ Yes. And Alan Bennett, you've written about sex before, shows up in ""History Boys,"" which, of course, is your best-known play and several other works of yours. But ""Smut"" is - I think it's one of the most explicit things you've actually ever written. Why did you decide to go in that direction?",0
52199,"  The best thing I ever did in my life.  It's in San Miguel      de Allende, which is a 400-year-old Spanish colonial city.  The loudest      voice you hear in town is the guy in the jardin, which is the center of      town, selling newspapers.  He's the loudest guy you ever hear... __EOS__  Wow. __EOS__  ...and I like that, you know.  It's quiet, yet you can      find anything you're looking for. __EOS__  But I imagine, going down with three or four pals to write up      songs in Mexico, it would take a lot of self-discipline.

52200," Good morning, Lynn. __EOS__ So to being, just could you give us a sense of just how much these families and a few others really have dominated the politics of the Philippines? __EOS__ Well, theyve dominated it very much so, for the past generations. Ours is not a political arena based on ideologies, but more so on character -almost brand. And with these last names  the Estradas, the Marcoses, the Aquinos, these are old names that have been around for decades. And in some cases, illogically they trust them somehow. __EOS__ How have they shaped life in the Philippines? ",0
52201," Yeah, we pay ourselves $1,500 a month.__EOS__ And you opened for Nine Inch Nails?__EOS__ Yes. Oh, well, I was going to say when we opened up for Nine Inch Nails - I mean, in order to go on that tour, we had to lose money.__EOS__ That's because the headliner band takes about half the gross ticket sales at a big sold-out show. The venue and the promoter take almost all the rest. Deals vary a lot, but the opening band that wants the exposure might get a few hundred or a $1,000 a night.",2
52202," Right. __EOS__ And I think it's why Batman's been more popular recently, because in our culture, there's, you know, there's much more aspiration to be a billionaire success than it is to be a farm worker or a newspaper reporter. So we've kind of become the sort of people who would rather have Batman or Iron Man. __EOS__ I'm speaking with comic book writer Grant Morrison, and his new book ""Supergods"" is in bookstores right now. Grant, can we talk about cross-dressing? __EOS__ Sure, we can. ",0

We're happy to report that she's now in remission and feeling well. That set was recorded and is now out on CD. It's called ""Live.""__EOS__ So at this part in your set, you're talking about how you were trying to - like, one night you were just so depressed you were trying to drown your troubles with food, but the problem was because of still recovering from the C. diff, there was very little that you could eat. So, like, you were binging on Triscuits because they're basically like wheat flour and water.__EOS__ That's rock bottom.",3

52207," Mm-hmm. __EOS__ When you are reporting from a war zone and youre getting shot at, do you ever wish you had a gun like you did in the military when you were in the war zone? __EOS__ You know, I got over that a long time ago. We make our choices and I made mine. And I'm not a combatant. I dont carry weapons and I dont want to. __EOS__ Can you tell us a little bit about how you made the decision to go from being in the military to being a reporter and eventually covering war? ",0
52208," Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception."" In the memoir, McClellan writes that he passed false information to the press after being lied to by Karl Rove and Dick Cheney. He also assails the White House for the overall case it made for the war in Iraq. __EOS__ Scott McClellan took over as President Bush's spokesman in July of 2003, three months after the start of the Iraq War, and at a moment when the White House case for the war was coming under a closer scrutiny. Part of that scrutiny was a disputed CIA report which led to the leaking of the name of CIA operative Valerie Plame. Scott McClellan had to deal with the widespread belief that the leak came from someone inside the White House, either Karl Rove or Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis Scooter Libby. Here's what McClellan said to reporters then. __EOS__ I spoke with them so that I could come back to you and say that they were not involved. I had no doubt with that in the beginning, but I like to check my information to make sure it's accurate before I report back to you. That's exactly what I did. __EOS__ Of course the subsequent investigation revealed that Libby and Rove did talk to reporters about Valeria Plame. Libby was later found guilty of charges related to the investigation of the leak. Rove was never charged. But in his book, McClellan now says he was misled by both of them and by Vice President Cheney. But the broader assault in his memoir is on the Bush White House in general and the man McClellan worked for going back to the time the president was governor of Texas - McClellan's home state. ",0
52209," Wow. So as we record this, it looks like the nominated songs, the two nominated songs, are not going to be performed at the Oscars. I feel cheated, but probably not nearly as cheated as you feel.__EOS__ I was disappointed when I found that out. That was just the other night. And, I mean, I'm not complaining to have to go to the Oscars. I'm pretty excited about it all, but, yeah, it would've been fun to get a man and a Muppet up there.__EOS__ Do you know why they're not performing the songs?__EOS__ I don't, actually. I'm not sure. I mean, it seems crazy. From my experience it's always good to put a couple of songs in a show. So I don't know. It just seems that, like, even if they weren't going to broadcast it they could just have them and then cut them.",2
52210," Whether or not you're in a union mine or not. The feeling was that a lot of these mines aren't going to be profitable if they have to work with the unions. So that's the only reason they have as good a job as they have because this mine is open and they love their employer and they're not going to mess with it. There was - that was the sensibility around that. __EOS__ And we keep talking about the guys on your crew, and the particular crew you were covering were all men. Are - were there any women miners? __EOS__ There are few. There was one at the mine where I worked. Very few. It's almost like, you know, sort of seeing, I don't know, a peacock or something in a mine. It's very unusual. __EOS__ Let's get Stephanie on the line. Stephanie is with us from Charlotte, North Carolina. ",3
52211," Yes. Well, Cannes differs from year to year in attitude and tone. You know, a few years ago, during, you know, at the beginning of the Iraq War, you could actually feel the hostility to Americans because Europeans in particular didn't like the war. What was striking this year was what I would call the existence of austerity Cannes. And you know, that may sound like a contradiction in terms because during the festival Cannes actually is home to the greatest concentration of wealth in the world, you know, because of all those people out in yachts are worth billions of dollars. __EOS__ Are European newspapers going through the same kind of cutbacks that American newspapers are? Are European newspapers folding at the rate American newspapers are? __EOS__ Well, European newspapers are suffering in the way American newspapers are, but not to the same extent. And what you dont have in Europe in the same way is, you know, the steady drumbeat of papers actually going under. At the same time, you - I think film criticism is taken more seriously in Europe than it is in the U.S. Whereas here I think at many papers the film critic is now thought to be a luxury, and so all across the country newspapers and magazines have just gotten rid of the film critics. Whereas you know, in France, you know, I think you'd probably get rid almost anything before you'd get rid of the film critic for your paper. __EOS__ So let's talk about some of the winners at the Cannes Film Festival. The film that won the festival's top prize is ""The White Ribbon."" Tell us about the film. What'd you think of it? ",1

52213," That's the rule that requires when there's a head coach opening, that requires the owners to interview candidates of a minority background.__EOS__ That's correct, and I believe that has changed the landscape in your football. It went from 6 percent to 22 percent between 2003 and 2006. Now, those are the kind of numbers - that's the kind of change that we need in England, right across society. You look at the way fans have to behave in the ground, and most clubs, they have a very, very tough stance on this. And if you're caught racially abusing anyone, they will hit you very hard. But in terms of the policies and procedures, when you look at the statistics happening in football with 1 in 3 black players and no black managers out of 92 football clubs, there is obviously a problem. Now, the argument is, what's to be done about that?__EOS__ Jason Roberts is a former professional soccer player and a frequent sports contributor to the BBC. He's also the founder of the Jason Roberts Foundation, which provides education and sporting opportunities for kids in the U.K. and Grenada. Jason, thank you.

And if not, is there a chance that the VJs will be prosecuted? __EOS__ Yes, obviously, they're kept - their names are kept secret for their safety. They have several nom de guerre, several names which they apply. And actually, we had - apart from their normal cover names, we had special cover names for this film just to make extra sure. And that's just what you need to do if you want to operate in a regime like the Burmese. It's a very real problem. And even in Thailand, where many of them work, Joshua is non-exile in Thailand. Even then he's not really safe. It's packed with Burmese intelligence trying to figure out what he's up to. ",1

52217," The former singer of Talking Heads was in Brazil to promote a film when he stopped into a record store In Rio De Janeiro. __EOS__ His record had the word samba on the cover, but it also had a picture of barbed wire, which made it stand out from all the other samba records which either had pictures of the singers or beautiful women on the cover. So I thought this one seems like it has something slightly different to say than the others. __EOS__ That was Ze's 1976 album, Estudando o Samba. __EOS__ The title of Tom Ze's new album is a play on this old one. Estudando o Samba means studying samba. Estudando o Pagode means studying Pagode, a style of dance music that Ze says is popular in Brazil. In his operetta Ze combines Pagode with Bach and Jobim.

52218," Absolutely. They - as I said, they exude that charm. They're both good-looking. They dance onstage. They sing great songs, original songs.

52219," You guys are getting ready to go on tour, and you'll be out of Portland for a while. Is it hard to be away from Portland?__EOS__ It's hard to just be away from home. Tour is so fragmentary and jarring by nature. There's nothing consistent about it, except the moment you're on stage, and that's why that moment is the best part of tour. Everything else, like, a moderately clean hotel room, like, just living out of a suitcase, it's just not conducive to, like, healthy living. You know, you trick yourself and you bring running shoes and you just think, every morning I'm going to wake up, and I'm going to go down to that crappy gym in the basement. And I'm going to get on, like, a treadmill from 1998 that I'll probably fall off of. Oh, it's so unglamorous. Anyone that thinks tour is glamorous should try it, really. They should try it. But, no, I love playing shows, and I love going to different cities. But I wish I could teleport myself back to my own bed every night.__EOS__ That's singer and guitarist Carrie Brownstein. Her new band is called Wild Flag. Their self-titled debut album was released this month. And you can catch the band on tour starting in October. Carrie Brownstein, thank you so much.__EOS__ Thank you.",2
52220," That's not my style. __EOS__ But it is interesting that you got more airplay for this song than you - outside of the country than you did in. And then there's also just people are used to social critique from you. They know that, you know, Pink has things to say about the culture. But it's interesting when you kind of walk right up to the politics, like, this is how it is right now and I want to talk about it, doesn't seem as though there was as much receptivity. I don't know if you experienced it that way, but that's how it seems. __EOS__ I feel like that was one of the most important songs for me and Billy Mann of our entire careers. I mean, the respect that I got just from my father alone and the conversation that that song started between him and I was so worth it. I didn't want that song to be a single. I didn't want it to be a publicity stunt. I didn't even want it to be aggressive. My way is usually - you know, it's my way or the highway, and I'm right and you're wrong, and you can go to hell.  __EOS__  How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?

52222,"  ""You Are "" has four movements, each with short      sayings culled from sources as diverse as the Hebrew Psalms and German      philosophers. The composer has been a serious student of Judaism for the      past three decades. The text of the first movement, ""You Are Wherever      Your Thoughts Are,"" comes from the writings of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov,      a Hasidic mystic from the 18th century.  Steve Reich says his words      resonate on many levels. __EOS__  ""You Are Wherever Your Thoughts Are"" is,      amongst other things, first true of us human beings.  I mean, you know,      you and I can be--and everybody else listening can be, you know, sitting      wherever they're sitting, but what's in your mind is sort of really where      they are.  But it's also a wonderful description of how we listen to      music.  As the music goes, so we go if we're really listening. __EOS__   You are wherever your thoughts are.  You are wherever      your thoughts are. __EOS__  Reich has been getting people to listen to music in different      ways for the past 40 years.  His interests are wide-ranging.  He's as apt      to talk about quantum mechanics as he is to tell you about the computer      program he uses to compose music on his laptop.  And his work reflects      years of studying African drumming, Balinese gamelan, Hebrew      cantillation, jazz and early Western classical music.  For instance, in      ""You Are ,"" Reich doubles all the vocal lines with woodwind      instruments.  It's a technique he says he picked up from a master. ",2

Some disaster strikes, maybe a meteor, maybe a nuclear war, and two survivors trudge along a road, a father and son. This movie is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, which passed into the hands of director John Hillcoat. __EOS__ It hit me like a freight train emotionally, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. You know, I have an eight-year-old boy, gorgeous boy, but it's beyond that. There's just fundamental issues about how people behave under pressure and how much we take for granted. __EOS__ In the movie, father and son walk the road beneath a sky that's always gray.

He goes on to say, an appoggiatura, or leaning note, must occur on the beat and be half the length of the main note value. To put it simply, the appoggiatura must produce an accented dissonance, not merely a fleeting one. And by way of example, Mr. Maroney points us to the word connection when Kermit the Frog sings ""Rainbow Connection.""__EOS__  Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.__EOS__ And, in The Beatles' song, ""We Can Work It Out,"" Mr. Maroney steers us to the words  my way and your way.__EOS__  Try to see it my way.

They're looking to purge Yemen of western influences as well. And they ebb and flow in terms of their strength, but we've seen changes recently that suggest that they are, again, growing in strength.__EOS__ And can you sketch out the new battle lines? It's not just the Yemeni government fighting Al-Qaeda. There's a third player now.__EOS__ Yes, that's right. The third player in Yemen now is a group called the Houthis. And the Houthis were a rebel movement based in northern Yemen, and they've expanded their influence in the last few months. They took over the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, in September, and their are advance has provoked a violent reaction from Al-Qaeda and from allies who seem concerned about the advance of the Houthis.__EOS__ With three groups all fighting each other in the country and these various changing of alliances you're talking about, is there anywhere in Yemen that is stable?",3

52229," If you're just joining us, my guest is pianist Jeremy Denk. He has a new album of music by Ligeti and Beethoven. So, we've heard some of the Ligeti that you play. Let's hear some of the Beethoven. Let me start by asking you why you've grouped these two composers together. What commonality do you find in them?__EOS__ There's a lot of different commonalities. One thing is that late Beethoven was so insane in many ways that those - some elements of the last pieces, the whole 19th century couldn't really deal with. And I think only in the mid-20th century do people begin to sort of take up the weird mania of late Beethoven and use it for further explorations.__EOS__ And on a more prosaic level, I think a comparison is that both the Ligeti that we've heard and the Beethoven we're about to hear seem very obsessive about, you know, repeating a certain theme or a pattern in a very tumultuous and demanding way.__EOS__ Yeah, Beethoven obsesses about this three-note idea in the first movement, and it becomes kind of a - what they call kind of a fixed obsession, like fixed .",2

But she has empathy, Nat does, you know. And she worries about her parents experience, their last days on Earth. She wants those last days not to be difficult for her parents. So that's part of it.__EOS__ How do you write for the young adult audience or are you, for the most part, not conscious of it?__EOS__ Not conscious. I mean, in this instance, I just wrote about someone I liked. But I unfortunately don't have the knack of writing specifically for an age group.  I'm not calculating enough in the way I approach writing. So it's less abstract and philosophical than some of my so-called literary books for, maybe for older readers. But it's still not action packed like Percy Jackson.__EOS__ Do you have any concern that this book is sometimes so detailed that it might not just sweep up young readers but it might frighten them?",0
52232," That's an interesting thing. The Klan, that version of the Klan which rises in the late 1910s, is really more of an anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish movement. One of the realities is that in addition to the brewers who were largely German, the distillers were very heavily Jewish, and they were seen as the enemy. __EOS__ You write in your book that for some populists, Prohibition was a good way to justify the institution of an income tax. What was the connection between Prohibition and an income tax? __EOS__ Well, going back as far as the Whiskey Rebellion of the 1790s and then the beer tax that was brought in during the Civil War to finance the Civil War, the federal government had been dependent upon the excise tax on alcohol to operate. __EOS__ So the income tax made it possible for Prohibition.

The percussionist in most jazz bands is way in the back.__EOS__ Right. The drummer is usually in the back of a big band, but what Tito did with his orchestra is he put the percussion up front, the conga, the bongo and himself on the timbales in the front. Now, that served a dual purpose. He could cue the orchestra, and it also served as a symbol that he was the leader of the band to the audience and that he was the law, as far as it was concerned.",2

52239,"  I was going to ask you about that just to set the table a bit.  In 2006, former President Bill Clinton, when he traveled to Guatemala, apologized for the U.S. government's role in this conflict that claimed so many lives.  Was this useful?  And if so, why? __EOS__  Yeah, it was useful for two reasons.  First, having the United States to recognize involvement in the massacres and destruction of indigenous culture by supporting dictators such as the generals, who have ruled the Guatemalan country, is a step to understand the situation of oppression or repression that the indigenous people have lived, because they always denied involvement in the past.  And indigenous people were hopeful that after the words of apology by President Clinton, something more positive could come such as funding, roads, running water, electricity, schools.  So indigenous people need these social programs to really advance and compete with other non-indigenous in Guatemala for a better future of the country. __EOS__  Kevin, the irony, of course, is that President Clinton having gone to Guatemala to apologize for the government's role in this conflict that was so harmful to the indigenous people there, but there's never been an apology by an American government for atrocities directed at the American-Indian or native people here.  There was an attempt made in the Senate side.  U.S. Senator Sam Brownback offered this, passed the Senate, but it failed in the House. What do you think of this?  What would an apology look like, sound like? __EOS__ First of all, any apology has to be comprehensive in order to be effective. President-elect Obama was asked at the meeting of the Journalists of Color about the possibility of an apology to Native Americans. And he said, I would want to consult with the tribes. And at first, I thought, well, that's not a very good answer. And then I realized what he was really saying is, I need them to tell me what their understanding of the grievances are. And once you've done that, you must acknowledge the entirety of the grievance in order to have an effective apology. So I think that's part of it.  ",3

And you write that most of the suffering that you'd seen didn't affect you as you thought it should have.__EOS__ Well, in that piece, I talk about a truck bomb that happened in I think the first month that we were overseas. A suicide truck bomber had exploded in a crowd of families going to mosque, and Marines brought the wounded onto base. Very early in the night, I was carrying a stretcher with a young, Iraqi kid.  It was the first time I'd ever seen anybody, let alone a child, who had those kind of injuries. Bombs do very, very bad things to human bodies. It's incredibly shocking to see. And I remember thinking that I would never forget that child's face, and then by the end of the night, I couldn't have picked him out of a lineup. I'd seen far, far too many injured people. The surgeons were doing surgery on the floor because the wounded had swamped the trauma tables.",0

52244," If someone finds that unusual or at least worth noting - yeah, I think that's valid, perhaps. But for me, it's not something that I'm that self-conscious about. When I'm listening to this music, I'm really listening for the music. And I understand sort of the historical circumstances in which this music is emerging from, and as someone who studies race and thinks about the ways in which race and racism works in society, it actually makes that music all the more poignant to understand the relationship between, let's say, a song like Sam Cooke's ""Change is Gonna Come"" in the civil rights movement in what's going on in America during that time. So it actually enriches my interest in those things. __EOS__ What's your definition of soul music? What makes soul soul? __EOS__ Oh, you know, this is going to be a copout except, I think it's true - ultimately, you know soul music when you hear it. __EOS__ What about ""Che Che Cole""?

It seems that civil law has a civilizing effect on society whereas religious law traditionally, in any religion, causes conflict. Would you comment on that, please?__EOS__ I don't think religious law necessarily causes conflict. It may do. Conflict occurs between people who have a sort of  sum-total view of the world that, you know, we are right, you are wrong, and therefore we must continue to fight until we subjugate you.",0

Google apparently has been tracking what people are searching for through - in Safari, which is a different web browser than Google's. And Google has been tracking people's use of Safari on cell phones and computers. What's the point?__EOS__ The concern in the beginning was that Safari wasn't allowing what are called third parties to put cookies in the browser, unless there was a very good reason for it having to do with your wanting information from them. So Google figured out a way around it. The reason they wanted to do that is because they wanted to see if people were members of their Google + social site, social media activity.__EOS__ Yeah.

52248,"  Now, in Beverly Hills they gave him chills and South Central put his soul in the deep freeze, but she gave him her keys. __EOS__ Director Annie Dorsen suggested the title, ""Passing Strange,"" from a line in Shakespeare's Othello — a play in which a black man navigates in a white world. Othello, speaking of wooing his wife Desdemona, says, she gave me for my pains a world of sighs. She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange. __EOS__ The resonances of it, obviously, go far beyond the original source, and there's a lot of discussion in the piece about passing and what that means — time passing, passing for black, passing for white. Passing for black is actually — I say that like it's a common idea, but of course it is not a common idea. Passing for white is the common idea. And in this piece, it's turned on its head. __EOS__ In ""Passing Strange,"" the character of the Youth adopts a streetwise persona to impress his fellow artists in Berlin. ",2

But as you've discussed it, you've been talking about it in class?__EOS__ Yes, we have writing classes, and we have done writing assignments about the different vignettes.

52253," Anyone they fought had the disease, they rounded up and held briefly and then forced onto the cattle stalls of inter-island boats and sailed them across the channel to Molokai and left them on this natural prison. Robert Louis Stevenson later visited and called it a prison fortified by nature and, indeed, that's what it was. The tallest sea cliffs in the world sort of rise up on the southern part of it and at the bottom of this cliff is a little triangle of land and it was surrounded by lava rock and the waves would hit and you weren't able to land on it and so you either, sort of floated yourself to shore or climbed down the cliff. Those first colonists that came, when they stumbled to shore sort of wet and soaking and in shock, the resident superintendent, he handed each of them a blanket and a hoe and told them to make a life for themselves. __EOS__ Really, you have some stories and maybe you could tell us one about the sort of desperate things people would do when they though they might have leprosy and would be taken away. __EOS__ Sure. In the first years in Molokai the cruelest patients would treat the community almost as a prison yard. The children and women were bought and sold. There were moon shiners and the patients delighted in terrorizing every newcomer. Every week new groups of patients were brought. If they arrived in the dark, the most disfigured of the patients would stand around with torches cackling and shouting, in this place there is no law, and people would do anything to evade it including murdering doctors, murdering the government agents that came to diagnose them, hiding in caves and fleeing to the hills. __EOS__ There was one character that Jack London, the author, wrote a story about, Koolau.

52255," Oh, if I took out the word differently it would be exactly it. I was interested in how a man and a woman - how do these two people would respond to being, in some sense, captive of that kind of terrible past and so many people's lives in this time have been shattered by similar kinds of losses and violence. And how do they go on from that point and take the risk of loving again and learn to trust? Those were the question. How do you get out of that kind of old story? That's the question that interested me. __EOS__ A lot of opera occurs, mainly because Andreas is conductor and he works with the opera. And he Kyra play this little game where they go to some of the main plots of, you know, both Shakespeare and opera and they play this what-if game, you know? __EOS__ Oh, right, the game of change the ending. __EOS__ Change the ending.

52260," No. __EOS__ I should start writing that. __EOS__ There were some messages. I thought there were some coded messages in this one.

But kind of bad for business though since you... __EOS__ That's right. ",2
52261," You also come to the conclusion that if this once was, as James Brown famously said, a man's world, maybe not so much anymore. __EOS__ Yeah, I mean, that was one of the big questions in my mind is, is it still a man's world? And I suppose there are many arguments you could get into politically and socioeconomically about that. I think there's still a lot of disagreement on that level, but in terms of, I suppose, liberation, emotional and cultural liberation, my feeling is that the notion of what we consider a woman has expanded dramatically in the last 25 years. And I think in many ways, I experienced it as a much larger concept. In other words, I can incorporate things that I learned from Ned into Nora. They can, they easily flow that way. But the other, they did not flow well in the other direction. That the notion of manhood, what's acceptable in especially heterosexual manhood, is much more narrow. __EOS__ Hmm. Here's an e-mail from Emily in Oakland. I'm wondering whether you kept up your normal persona during the 18 months with people at home. This would have added to the difficulty of, as you mentioned, keeping your psychological balance. I did hear you say you did date a little as a woman but did you have a sibling or a mate you could talk to on the side or did you completely drop out from regular life from the time of research? __EOS__ I was living with my wife at the time, so I did have someone to decompress with, which was really invaluable and she deserves a gold medal for all the things she went through with me. But, I did and I did have times where I was writing. I had downtime during the whole period and that did make it a little bit harder because I did, although it did heighten the contrast, again, because I was on, sometimes on any given day, the same day I would go out in public as a man, both a man and a woman. And I might go to the same store and find, you know, see what the difference was in how I was treated. So that was an interesting thing but, yes, I think it did help to accelerate the breakdown.

52262," John, what do you think?__EOS__ Oh, yeah, definitely. I think when Kentucky and Louisville met in 1983 in the NCAA tournament was the first time they have played in a while because they did not - at that time, they did not play every year, and people referred to it as the dream game. I think meeting in the Final Four is kind of like the dream game personified.__EOS__ And, Eric, why do Louisville fans hate Kentucky? What's at the root of that?__EOS__ Well, you know, John referenced it that for years, you know, Kentucky wouldn't play Louisville, and that it wasn't a big deal for a while. But as Louisville got better and better under Coach Denny Crum, they won a national championship, and Kentucky still refused to play them. So I think there's a lot of resentment there. It's pretty deep-seated and more than just at basketball level.",3
52263," You just can't have a narrow focus, can you? I mean, after writing the history of everything, you just...__EOS__ Well, that was part of the problem, is that I really was thinking, you know, I've done a history of a universe. So now what? What's left? And so that was when I thought, well, maybe I'll just look at my own house.__EOS__ Now, one of the themes of your book is the evolution of comfort in the house. It wasn't always so pleasant to be at home. Can you read a passage explaining - let's pick a - what a drawing room is here?__EOS__ Sure. I happen to have it right here in front of me. Nowhere in the house is the spirit - if not always the actuality - of comfort better captured than in the curiously named room in which we find ourselves now  the drawing room.",0
52264," Well, I thought it was quite a tremendous thing. You know, I walked from, I think, up by the Treasury Department down to Constitution Avenue and got in line and I was just surprised at the number of people that were in the line. I worked in a computer group in the Navy Yard and we were all off that day or something. And none of my counterparts came to the March. But in the line there were whites beside me, behind me, front of me, walking just like I was walking, and I thought this was a day that would live, you know, in our memory. And I never got up close, but I was in the trees and I always thought about that some of the people along the reflecting pool I saw and some people standing in the open and see, well, people under the trees all the way as far as the eye could see.__EOS__ You knew even then that it was a big day.__EOS__ I knew. We had a million people down there and it was a big day. And the speech - I didn't know how famous it would be at the time, you know, because Martin Luther King speaks very well. Some of his speeches were tremendous, especially the one the night before he was murdered - that speech that was really a heavy speech also.__EOS__ But you're saying the ""I Have a Dream"" speech, at the time, you thought, that's a pretty good speech but not one of his best?

I'm just curious, what was it like being the toast of the town in the biggest city in the country? __EOS__ Well, I had so many people - when I first came to New York, I went to a place called the Red Rooster's and Small's Paradise, that's up on Seventh Avenue at that time. And everybody there made sure that I never got into trouble. __EOS__30, 10 00 and I saw all these people out there in the street. And I'm saying, my God, what are they doing out here?

That is, you know, she's not fragile. And I'm not mean. And to imply otherwise is a disservice to us both. No one ever said, you know, oh, that Will Ferrell.

52267," Yes, I do. I think he was being jealous of Mandela because he had been the darling of Africa up to that point. Mugabe is very, very well developed intellectually but not emotionally. Mandela was so much more relaxed. You know, Mandela had charisma or rather a real warm kind, and I think Mugabe deeply resented this. I think it was probably a sort of sibling rivalry that he perceived. __EOS__ There's just one exchange from your lengthy interview with Mugabe that I'd like you to recount. It's when he's actually telling you, and you're being pretty challenging with him, and he's telling you that actually, the economy of Zimbabwe is excellent and it's better than other countries in Africa. He's talking about the minds, he's talking about - the only thing missing is the products in the stores where people to buy. It's an extraordinary comment. __EOS__ Yes, well, that's when I knew that he was completely deluded. I mean, it was just so obvious, then it had been obvious earlier on when he made comments like he doesn't make enemies other people make him an enemy of theirs and so on. But once he made light of the fact that there were no goods to buy on the shelves, it was completely clear that he was deluded. And yet when I said that to the priest who would organize the interview for me, I said to him, the president is very deluded about the economy, and he said, yes, well, that's because people don't tell him the truth, which is just not the right answer. He answer is you can't tell Mugabe the truth. He's deluded now to such an extent and he's positioned himself in such a way in a bubble where nobody can tell him the truth. You know, he can't be wrong, he can only be right. So, he really does live a very detached life now. __EOS__ It's Heidi Holland whose book ""Dinner with Mugabe"" has been published in South Africa. She's talking with us from Johannesburg and I gather the book is available online but not in book stores in the U.S. ",0
52268," Thank you, Michel.__EOS__ As we said, this is an ongoing story and we'd like you to know that we have attempted to reach George Zimmerman's lawyer to get his and his client's perspective on these events, as well as George Zimmerman's friend, Joe Oliver, who's been speaking on his behalf. We'll certainly continue to do that.__EOS__ That was being in Vietnam and other things in my life, this is just way beyond anything that I could imagine.__EOS__ What's your next step?",3
52269," Does this also fit, in some way, say, with the laws of eating kosher?__EOS__ It does, absolutely. The whole point of the laws of eating kosher is that certain things are unclean. But the kosher laws are also a way of kind of creating a barrier between observant Jews and people who are not. And now the people at Qumran or in the Essenes were people who wanted to build a thick wall between themselves and nonobservant people, you know, to lessen the danger of impurity rubbing off.__EOS__ It sounds like they maybe wanted to build a wall between themselves and other Jews, too.__EOS__ Very much so. Actually, it's primarily between themselves and other Jews that they're concerned with. The only time they talk about Gentiles are when they talk about what they call the Kittim, which was their name for the Romans. And they are just, you know, the enemy, sons of darkness to be destroyed in the final battle. But they don't really interact with them on a daily basis.",0
52270," It is difficult to get into the country, or is it difficult for anybody or you in particular? __EOS__ I think it's difficult for media and for journalists. I think to go wandering out of the border with a camera, you'd be given short shrift and sent back over. But... __EOS__ Us, in particular, it might be tricky. __EOS__ Yeah. I'm sure they're mad at the moment. ",1
52271," Well he was willing to. It was hard to get him in there and again I used little tricks. Peter Snyder, that cellist from the orchestra, agreed to give him lessons. And I said Nathaniel thus we've got Mr. Snyder who wants to give you lessons. Here is a great opportunity. And by this point, LAMP Community's mental health folks thought that he was advanced enough that he could move into an apartment. And this is an apartment in what's called permanent supportive housing. __EOS__ And that was comforting to him, yeah. At one point one of the other residents in this LAMP Community, people who had, you know, many of them schizophrenia and many of them who had been homeless, came to you and said in a very tough and challenging way, when are you going to tell the real story? When are you going to write the real story about your friend Nathaniel? What did he mean? __EOS__ What he meant was that Nathaniel was not always, as I - as I have said, the refined genteel man of music and poetry. There's - there was always, lurking just beneath the surface, this other guy who lives inside of him. And it's an angry, resentful, paranoid guy who thinks that people are stealing things from him; and who thinks that they're out to get him; and that he's got to defend himself. And it can be very intimidating. __EOS__ And you had one terrible experience with him yourself, and this was when, you know, you got to know his family a bit. His sister, you - you connected with, and there came to be a legal issue, right, where you wanted to have her have some legal authority. And he regarded this with the sort of paranoid rage that you had seen in others. And you had this really disturbing exchange, if you could describe that? ",0
52272," And you've used the term Salafi several times. That's a traditional kind of fundamentalist kind of current of Islam?__EOS__ That's, you know, what we can call them, the ultra-conservative. You know, they are very, very restrictive in the way they interpret Islam. They have a very specific ideology. Of course not all the Salafis are jihadis, but all the jihadis are Salafis. And if we're talking about that issue now, then we have to look into the whole map of the resistance in Syria, and we see - we were talking about the foreigners and the jihadis, but if we talk about the Salafis in general, the ultra-conservative, you see them as a, you know, probably 30, 40 percent of all the fighting now happening in Syria is a sort of Islamic in some way or some sort.__EOS__ Wow, so they're in effect posing as religiously observant in order to promote the opposition?__EOS__ Dave, 90 percent of all the battalions in Syria have a very Sunni conservative name not because 90 percent of the fighters are ultra-conservative Islamists, although this is what the Syrian regime and others would like to portray it, but because the support is coming through specific channels, and one of these channels are the Saudis.",3
52273," But I will say that though I think that Judy's songs, and her performances, her renditions are imbued with hope and beauty, but there is this sort of dark side. __EOS__ Hmm.  __EOS__ And if in some way I can steer it to a more hopeful place, and to sort of take it out of that destination, then I'm happy about that. But I don't want to like express that desire to do it purposefully. But if people want to do that, that's great. __EOS__ Whoa! ",2
52274," Okay. Thanks very much for the call. __EOS__ Okay. Uh-huh. Bye-bye. __EOS__ Bye-bye. Let's talk with Matt. Matt with us from Gainesville, Florida - the other side of the state. __EOS__ Yeah. Hi. In case you didn't hear, on Monday, our football team, the University of Florida, won the football national championship. ",0
52275," So when you were listening to, for instance, Howlin' Wolf, the great blues singer, he's from another era, he's from another country, and you know, African-American music - what did you relate to about his music as a young girl growing up in rural England? __EOS__ Well, it's very hard to put into words, and this is where I constantly struggle with trying to describe music in words. But the best I could do is to say the soul, the spirit of it touched my soul and spirit in a way that I under - felt understood and understood it. And I can't describe it better than that. __EOS__ My guest is musician, songwriter and singer PJ Harvey. Her new album is called ""Let England Shake."" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. __EOS__ My guest is musician, singer and songwriter PJ Harvey. Her new album is called ""Let England Shake."" When we left off, she was talking about being influenced by the blues albums in her parents' collection. ",2
52276,  We know it's wrong for us to meet but the fire's gone out at home. __EOS__  And there's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is gone. Love is where you find it... __EOS__  ...when you find no love at home. __EOS__  And there's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is gone. ,2

52278," Now, New York City, you know, is an ethnic melting pot. Hundreds of thousands of, you know, first-generation immigrants live there. You note that this was a real strength of the police department in building counterterrorism intelligence. __EOS__ Actually, millions of first-generation immigrants live in New York. About 40 percent of the population of New York City, four-zero percent, was not born in the United States of America. And you can see that as a huge problem, if you want, but in fact, Kelly and Cohen saw it as, potentially, a great source of strength for their operations and what they needed to do. Because when you have a lot of first-generation immigrants, typically, especially in New York City, many of them decide that their best entry-level job in the United States is with the police force. And you had that with generations of Irish, Italians, Poles, Germans, and it's just as true today. So, the first thing that they did, when Kelly and Cohen started putting together the intelligence operations they wanted to run, was to ask for volunteers to come forward if they spoke another language. And they got about 1800 volunteers. They had them tested. They found 700 people who spoke - as native speakers - languages that were relevant to the fight against terrorists. __EOS__ When you say volunteers, you mean people that are on the police force, right? Yeah. __EOS__ Yeah, yeah. Volunteers, what they call white shields, cops in uniforms, guys out on the beat that, you know, happen to speak Pashto or Arabic or Dari or Bengali or Farsi. And once they were tested, all of a sudden, they looked at this and they had 700 people who can speak these languages, which were hugely in demand in 2002. You know, I think the number of graduates in Arabic from all universities and colleges in the United States in 2002, who spoke Arabic, graduated in Arabic programs, was six. So, there was a huge dearth of competent language - linguists and competent officers who spoke languages in the whole security establishment of the United States, but not in the NYPD. ",0
52279," Yes. Yes, a very similar film...__EOS__ A little different tone.__EOS__ Yeah, ""Being Flynn"" has a few more laughs than it. An example of Bob's attitude was a month before we were supposed to start shooting ""Being Flynn,"" I was in New York doing prep. And we got a weather report that it was supposed to blizzard the next day. And so, you never know when it's going to snow and I needed to have a section of the movie where DeNiro was walking around the streets in the snow.__EOS__ Looking like a homeless guy.",1
52280," And why can't people still working on Wall Street speak their mind? __EOS__ Well, they would be fired immediately if they spoke their mind. Even when they leave they need to sign confidentiality agreements so that their employers know that they won't speak their mind. You just don't, you can't do it, you don't shoot the golden goose. And particularly in a time like this when people are struggling on Wall Street and they're nervous about whether they'll keep their job or be able to get another job. This is the last time you would want to go out and out your firm. I think we will see a few people who have already made their bunch of money, who will come out now, who will talk about the problems. But most of the people are going to seal their lips. __EOS__ And you didn't have to sign a confidentiality agreement? __EOS__ Incredibly, no. I had my exit interview with Morgan Stanley and it was very cordial and I shook hands with the person who was giving me the exit interview and left and that was the end of it. If they had made me sign a confidentiality agreement I might not have been able to write ""Fiasco"". I would've encountered all kinds of problems with things that I've been saying or writing about. And fortunately I slipped through the cracks. ",0
52281," How's it going? __EOS__ You - the name of your band, Beirut, it was kind of a half a joke, right? __EOS__ Yeah. I was kind of poking fun at myself and some of my more exotic tastes in music at the time. __EOS__ Beirut was known as the Paris of the Middle East, and you're - you listen to a lot of Jacques Brel and Serge Gainsbourg and all these Parisian crooners, and I read that was the reason why you called yourself Beirut. ",2
52282," Must have felt the same. I was surprised when I was first in London to see St. Martin in the Fields, and it's a relatively small, little church tucked away in a major city square. Do you guys play a lot of home games?__EOS__ Well, you know, the funny thing about this orchestra, they've - I mean, they've made probably at least 1,000 recordings, maybe more than any other orchestra at all. I mean, they're very famous for their recordings. Around the world, they've got a, you know, very big name. They don't play a lot in London, and that's something I want to change now. I want to play more home games. There are very - they do tour just so much. And the St. Martin in the Fields itself is a small place, and it's not conducive to big symphonic things, but it's nice for some smaller chamber things, which they continue to do.__EOS__ We're talking with Joshua Bell. Again, his new CD with longtime collaborator Jeremy Denk is called ""French Impressions."" He's also the new conductor and musical director of the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's talk with Alan. Allan with us from Ferndale in Michigan.__EOS__ Hi. I just want to say, first of all, I was at your concert on Sunday at Hill Auditorium in Ann Arbor, and it was absolutely breathtaking, so thank you for that performance, Mr. Bell.",2

52285," He's from a New England family. And I remember, we would sit at the dinner table at his house when we were dating, and no one would talk. And then I would start to giggle. I would get this like, psychotic, hysterical laughter. So they already knew I was nuts. And I said, this is so refreshing. They don't ask about when I'm getting my period, or how much money I make, or did I make a doody today. You know, my family was so intrusive.__EOS__ Your mother wasn't very happy with me.__EOS__ No.__EOS__ She thought my name was Paul for many years.",3

They have a thoroughbred, and they're just along for the ride. __EOS__ His personality, I mean, the character - as he becomes this character of Kyle - is very quiet, has sort of this deceiving anger beneath the surface... __EOS__ Yeah. ",1
52287," Well, why wouldn't he tell you? He just - he didn't want you thinking? __EOS__ He didn't want you thinking, and if you start talking about what the character is feeling, you do have that danger of saying  Oh, I understand now. This is how you play embarrassment. And you play it the way you've seen somebody else play it, or you have some idea of how to play it. __EOS__ So this threw you off-balance, having... __EOS__ Yes. ",3
52288," Although, I think that sometimes people look at some of the more indigenous cookbooks or recipes and they get confused. Many of those ingredients are things that they don't recognize and they're not sure where to get them. Your book addresses that. It tells people how to get these ingredients, right?__EOS__ Yeah. And I think it helps people recognize that, you know, some of the things that might seem exotic are actually more commonly found now, but maybe not where you'd expect it because our foods have gone all over the world. So sumac, which was a seasoning that we used in the Upper Midwest a lot, is found in Middle Eastern food because they used it as well. So you could go to a Middle Eastern grocery or go online and buy Middle Eastern seasoning of sumac and have a similar, if not exactly the same, product. So, you know, the same thing with Nopales, which are considered a Mexican food, but this prickly pear cactus was eaten up in the Upper Midwest as well. So it's a matter of recognizing and seeing how some of the foods are the same. You know, corn in many forms has gone all over the globe. It's one of the most eaten foods on the planet. But it originated in this hemisphere.__EOS__ Corn, obviously, one of the three sisters. Corns, bean and squash, which we very much associated with, say, three sisters salad, which is something I grew up eating in the Southwest.__EOS__ Sure.",0
52289," Is there a song from this new CD that you'd like to go out on? __EOS__ Well, you know, I really love the version that we came up with for ""There Will Never Be Another You,"" which has a great tenor sax solo from Harry Allen. It's normally done as kind of an up-tempo swing number, and I also do the little-known verse up front that I almost never hear.  __EOS__  There will be many other nights like this... __EOS__ Very nice talking to you.

52291," A year ago, Carly Rae Jepsen had a respectable music career in Canada. She's been on stage there since age 7. She got a big break a few years ago after appearing on ""Canadian Idol."" But today, her single ""Call Me Maybe"" is a monster summer pop hit, number one on iTunes and number two on the Billboard charts, and this one song has helped her get a huge record deal. But the phenomenon behind the song may be even bigger. It spawned a host of fan-made music videos by everyone from the Harvard baseball team to Justin Bieber to actor James Franco to the commander-in-chief himself.__EOS__ Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy. But here's my number, so call me maybe.__EOS__ This version, of course, was edited from the president's speeches. Carly Rae Jepsen is barely keeping it up with it all. She's taking up on a national concert tour later this year. She was in the studio this past week with Dallas Austin. He's a producer who's worked with Michael Jackson and Madonna.

52292," A perfect example of the moment as she watches Pinkie recording a record that he gives to her. And that's the most blissful moment. And people have since said that must've been so, so harrowing. And I said, well, of course, it wasn't. She had no idea what he was saying and it was the most beautiful, exciting thing - the idea of what he might be saying.     __EOS__ They've asked me to make a record in my voice. Well, here it is. What you want me to say is I love you.     __EOS__ I think Andrea's interpretation of Rose, and Rose herself, is right. You know, Greene is often described as having penned a portrait of pure evil in Pinkie. And nothing could be further from the truth. I mean first off Greene was a Catholic and therefore would have found the idea of pure evil and humanity as slightly oxymoronic. Humanity is always capable of redemption.    __EOS__ We're speaking with Rowan Joffe who is the director, and the actor Andrea Riseborough, about their new film ""Brighton Rock."" Without explaining too much, Pinkie tries to romance Rose, and he has an interest to keep her from talking about something that she's seen. How do you turn that into romantic tension?   ",1
52293,"  Well, with all due respect to Sandy Berger, they failed      miserably in achieving that access.  And, you know, why could he not      succeed in three and a half years and President Bush succeed in 48 hours?      The fact of the matter is they were not interested in pursuing this. __EOS__  You make a further claim that in those talks instead of      persisting to get US law enforcement access into Saudi Arabia, the      president hit up the Saudis for a contribution to his presidential      library.  That's something that Mr. Clinton and his associates flatly      deny. __EOS__  We were told that by a very, very reliable source.  I wasn't      at those meetings.  I don't know who's contributed to the library.  The      Clinton Library has never released the names and the amounts of the      contributors.  But that was information I received, and it's stated      clearly as that in the book. __EOS__  But while I understand you explain your frustration with      President Clinton about that, you don't express much frustration in the      book with Prince Bandar, the longtime then-Saudi ambassador in Washington      whom you went to. And you write in the book that as helpful as Prince      Bandar was, you say, `He was not able to be completely forthright with me      at that first meeting.'  And then you detail that he knew that people had      been arrested with explosives heading into Saudi Arabia having done      surveillance at Khobar Towers.  I mean, the Saudis pretty well had the      goods on the block before it happened and they were of no use to us. ",0

And what he did was keep my salary alive for a year and gave me benefits and he said, go chase your dream.__EOS__ How did you get into comedy? Were you always funny? Did your family and friends always think you were funny?__EOS__ They always thought I was odd. They thought I was odd. I remember I was at a barbershop. They were - you know, back then, cats, they hustled. They did taxes. They sold VCRs. They were promoters. I was getting a haircut, and I used to talk about people in the barbershop. So finally, this guy said, if you think you're so funny, then open for this concert we're doing.

Champion or chore; either/or. __EOS__ In the written section of this book, there are some people who knew Elliott Smith really well, you know… ",2
52297," Is she sorry that you're not religious?__EOS__ No. No, I mean, she completely understands and she, you know, in season one there's that scene when Aunt Peg - which is kind of pseudo-grandma, called Aunt Peg and not grandma because I didn't want to make my grandmother sign a release form - but she stands up in church and does that, like, rant at the priest at him for being homophobic. There's, like, a scene where she does that and that was, like, my grandma did that. That's, like, almost verbatim what my grandma did.__EOS__ What did your grandmother say to the priest?__EOS__ She told me - she said I was sitting in church the other day and he was telling everyone that gay people are going to go to hell and that gay people are bad and I stood up and I said, I have three gay grandsons. And then she said actually, Josh, at the time you hadn't come out; I had two, but I've changed it. I have three gay grandsons and they're good people and they don't have a choice and, you know. They don't get to pick the color of their eyes and they don't get to pick their sexuality and we should love them all the same. Jesus said something and we should love them all the same and then she, like, sat back down, just this tiny 80-something-year-old woman standing up against the church. It sounds pretty incredible to me. I wasn't there; I didn't get to see it.",3

And Philip writes, ""The Gunslinger"" series has been my favorite since reading ""The Stand"" when I was 10 years old. I always thought Roland is the reluctant antihero, and I really love the circular nature of the ending. My question for Stephen King is this  Does he still have dreams of Roland's exploits, and what changes might have happened in Roland's next go-around? __EOS__ That's an interesting question. I don't have the sort of imaginative channel into that world that I did once. And I've tried to find it, actually, I thought it might go - be fun to go back and write more about Roland. And it might even be fun to take a more active role in the graphic novel since Roland's going to march along for a while under the Marvel imprint. I thought to myself, well, you know, I ought to be able to find something else. There's a lot of fertile territory there. ",0
52299," When's the last time you saw her? __EOS__ It must have been August 1st, 1993. __EOS__ Jose, there are authorities who will read your story, there are people who might even listen to this conversation, and they will have to make a decision about what they do. __EOS__ Well, lawyers told me not to publish this story at all. One of then, I think, said it was like legal suicide. You know, what is the priority here? Is the priority here me or is the priority here the issue? ",3
52300,"  Well, if that causes socialists to go out and buy my book      and like my books, I'm glad for anybody to like my books for any reason. __EOS__  You're not aware of the connection, though. __EOS__  I actually have had correspondence with a couple of Marxist      groups, one in the UK and one in the United States, who point out that      Marx emphasized the role of materialism in society and so one can see a      connection. __EOS__  OK.  Thank you. ",0

Tell me just briefly about the guys who were betting bad, who were creating this whole thing, were they just dumb? Did they just delude themselves because they were making so much money?__EOS__ Well, I think the world would like to think they're criminals because they're so angry at them now.

52308," So you describe yourself as having given birth at the dawn of uber-momism. Do you think you encouraged or discouraged that kind of uber-momism in your columns that you wrote about being a parent for The New York Times?__EOS__ Oh, I hope I discouraged it, first of all because there wasn't so much of it. But the other thing is that I think if you look at those columns or some of the columns I wrote later - my son the other day was saying that I had earlier posited that maybe the title of the book would be ""Mistakes Were Made.""__EOS__ And that's what I always say about motherhood. Mistakes were made, over and over again. And I think the problem with the uber-momism is that you convince yourself first of all that you can never make mistakes. Second of all, if you do, it will be tragic and traumatic.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Anna Quindlen, former columnist for The New York Times and Newsweek. She has a new book, a memoir called ""Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake,"" about life in her 50s. Let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.",3
52309," There's a whole lot of things we're doing which are going to have to be changed in the light of what the damage that we're doing to the Earth. And I used to be very pessimistic. I said there was 50-50 chance that there wouldn't be a world here in a hundred years. I confess I was more pessimistic than that. I said that, though, to encourage people to think that their one little teaspoon of effort would be what will save the world. But it's now millions of teaspoons doing things all over the country, all over the world. __EOS__ She's been on the program. We're talking with Pete Seeger. His new CD is called ""Tomorrow's Children."" __EOS__ Hello, Pete. __EOS__ Yeah. ",2
52310," I want to see women relating to each other more, in the ways that I think have been very helpful and integral in my life. When I look at female characters, I want to recognize myself in them - my trials, my tribulations as a mother, as a wife, you know; as a lover, as a daughter. I want to see the things that I struggle with. I want to see forte. I want to see the idiosyncrasies. I want to see complexity. I want to see the murky stuff. __EOS__ When you think of the demands on you to sell a picture, and to sort of make your name be more than just what it is on the screen, where do you draw the line? How public do you become? How much of a commodity do you become? __EOS__ You know, it's wild. It's really wild. I think the kind of career that I'm having, and the kind of career that I want to have, doesn't require a whole lot of prostitution - like, I don't have to dress up in skivvies and grace every cover of every hot lady magazine. It's tricky for me. I think the more I reveal myself, the harder my job becomes. And so, I mean, that's always for me, too, is the challenge. And how to preserve myself, and how to retain mystique so that people can suspend disbelief when I choose odd terrain. __EOS__ Vera Farmiga, it's been great to talk to you. Thanks for coming in.

52311," Jackson Cunningham of Champaign area, Illinois, here he was trying to buck up his junior senator. I thought this is a remarkable boy that I've got to meet and I eventually had the honor to meet Jackson.__EOS__ What did he say in that letter that reached you in such a way?__EOS__ He said, you know, hang in there, you know, do what your physical therapist -he used the terms that we stroke patients all know  PT, OT and ST which is physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. I could tell he was a veteran when he - of the stroke wars.__EOS__ Empathetic and understanding and patient. I would say some day he is going to be a really remarkable young man. I said to him eventually, hopefully, you'll replace me in the Senate.",3
52312," And when I heard that sound, I was inspired and uplifted and thinking, wow, this is how I am live. How can I translate this in the CD. And look at the audience I have - will they get that? __EOS__ And you actually cover ""Them Changes"" as a bonus track on your album. __EOS__ Oh yes. I had to. I worked on it with Rex Rideout, one of my producers, and the producer that predominantly did most of ""Lost and Found."" And we just took a different direction and different approach. And working with all the different producers really opened me up as well. __EOS__  Well, my mind is going through them changes, I'm going out of my mind, every time you see me going somewhere, I'm about to commit a crime. He had me running, had me riding. He had me running and crying and running, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's all right. What I say, it's all right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right now. Yeah, come on… ",2
52313," And what kind of playhouse was that? What kind of - is it downtown or...__EOS__ It's just a very small - yeah - community playhouse that has a 400 seat theater and a 200 seat theater and a 90 seat theater. And I was in the 200 seat theater and I thought 1,200 people would show up and only 30 showed up and I knew all of them. So lost everything, rent payment, car payment. All that money that I had saved was tied up in the show and I lost everything, but I kept going.__EOS__ So how did you get your second crack and what changed? Because people showed up the second time around so what was different?__EOS__ Well, that happened between from 1992 up until 1998. I did - I was doing one  performance a year, because what happened is I was out of money but there was always somebody in the crowd - out of that 30 there was a person who said I'd like to invest. So out of every show I'd do somebody would come along and try to invest in two or three shows and nothing would ever get off the ground. But what changed in 1998 was the show was about adult survivors of child abuse who had forgiven their abusers and I hadn't forgiven my father. And somewhere in that time I forgave him, so that was the thing that changed within me. And outwardly, everything changed. I recast the show, put it up in same city, six years later, and sold out nine shows.",1
52314,"  Sure. When you're ready.__EOS__  There's no chill, and yet I shiver. There's no flame, and yet I burn. I'm not sure what I'm afraid of, and yet I'm trembling. There's no storm, yet I hear thunder. And I'm breathless. Why, I wonder? Weak one moment, then the next I'm fine.__EOS__ So that was my guest, Barbra Streisand, and Mandy Patinkin in a scene from ""Yentl,"" which Barbra Streisand also wrote and directed.__EOS__ Exactly.",1
52315," It's clear you spent a lot of time with Robert Peace's mother - Jackie. What was she like?__EOS__ You know, I could go on and on about Jackie. I think she's the only perfect person in this story. She was a working mother - she worked very hard and then she came home and spent as much time with her son as possible. And she took him to the library, took him to the park. When he was about three, in daycare, the lady there told Jackie they were calling him the professor and she thought they were making fun of her or worse they were making fun of her son. Before she realized that they were calling him that earnestly in reference to his intelligence and curiosity.__EOS__ Now how did it affect Robert Peace? Still well under the age of 10 when his father was arrested for a double murder and eventually after a long delay put on trial and convicted?__EOS__ You know, the father-son bond is big stuff of course and particularly here. Rob really revered his father, who was sort of the mayor of the neighborhood as I gathered. Had a kind word to say about everyone, they would leave the house and go eat full meals at seven different friends' houses over the course of a day. And he was very active in Rob's academic life, drilled him with good penmanship, the importance of memory and continued to do so from prison. You know, using the prison phones, once or twice a week.",0
52316," Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, Holden Caulfield got to me later, you know, and I became - I was an English major, and I became an English professor. So I have those reading habits and tastes and that sort of history, too. But even now, my reading tastes are very sort of wide-ranging and promiscuous. __EOS__ That's good. Do you recommend that to your students? __EOS__ Yeah, I do. Absolutely. I mean, it's a - you know, I - yeah. I mean, I give that basically an unqualified yes. I mean, I think people should read what they want. That's what I tell my daughter who is now -she's 14 years old, so she's kind of on the cusp between reading YA and grownup books... __EOS__ Mm-hmm. ",0
52317," What are you going to do when this is all over? How long do you think you'll last? And George says, well, if we do as well as Cliff and the Shadows have done we won't be moaning. Now Cliff Richard and the Shadows had lasted up to this point, in the U.K., about five years - which was just seemed - just seemed a lifetime to everybody. And this question just keeps cropping up all the way through their career up to 1970. But nobody had any idea of how fast they would progress in every record they made would be a signal from the front to other groups  this is what you have to catch up to. They were so progressive. So it does put you back in the time.__EOS__ One more comment from that I want to add. Several of these listeners said it was, quote, ""mainly for the sake of the children who liked the beat groups."" But they themselves preferred the kind of music provided by Acker Bilk and Vince Hill, quote, ""an underrated artist who should be heard more often.""__EOS__ Yeah. More Vince Hill and less Beatles.__EOS__ I know. It's extraordinary to think, isn't it? And those audience research report comments continue all the way through their career. You know, in the 1969 chapter of the book, I talk about a program called ""24 Hours  The World of John and Yoko."" John and Yoko were followed around by BBC camera crew over several days, and then this documentary program was put together and broadcast December, 1969. And it is a very revealing portrait of John and Yoko, what they were doing at that time. There is an incredible interview transcribed in the book where John talks to Gloria Emerson, the London correspondent of The New York Times, who is not impressed by John and Yoko's peace campaign and what they're doing. And that's a remarkable interview to read. It's quite confrontational.",2
52318," The Origins, Evolution, And Future Of Islam."" Reza, welcome to the show.__EOS__ Thanks for having me.__EOS__ I've seen and heard conflicting things when it comes to Muslim sensibilities about depictions of Muhammad. You know, there's this sense that it's forbidden, but I know that I've seen historical depictions from, like, classical India showing the Prophet. So what are the rules?__EOS__ Well, there are no Koranic prohibitions against depictions of the Prophet Muhammad. And even among the six or so authorized schools of law, there's all kinds of disagreements about whether you can and how you can show the Prophet Muhammad. It's certainly a cultural taboo, but that taboo arose organically and through a long period of time, which is why, precisely as you say, the history of Islam teems with thousands and thousands of images of the Prophet Muhammad from his childhood, various scenes from his biography, all the way, really, to the end of his life. It's a very common thing that we see throughout Islam's history.",3
52319," They thought he was a socialist, I don't know. A lot of times, it was unclear whether or not they were able to even distinguish between what a socialist was or a communist or - there was just this sense that he was upsetting the status quo.__EOS__ These bankers were behind something that became known as the Wall Street Putsch. What was their plan?__EOS__ They thought that they could convince Roosevelt - because he was of their class, the patrician class, they thought that they could convince Roosevelt to relinquish power to basically a fascist, military-type government. It was a cockamamie concept. And the fact that it even got as far as it did is pretty shocking.__EOS__ How far did it get?",0
52320," Okay. And so you decide when that session is over that… __EOS__ I just peeled off a couple of hundreds and said, would you stay with me and eat? I've got to make this I'm almost sure I'm going to forget everything. __EOS__ Now, you were here. You were recording with Judy Collins. Were you two still a couple at the time? __EOS__ Well, a gentleman would never… ",3
52321," I play rock. I also play in a big band. I play some jazz and that sort of thing. But the rock… __EOS__ Oh, that's really cool. __EOS__ That's really cool. __EOS__ Yeah. You guys… ",2
52322," You write some about spiders, including the black widow, not as deadly as people think, right? __EOS__ Yeah, there's not actually much mention in the news of people getting bitten by a black widow or being harmed by a black widow until the 20th century. __EOS__ Bugs have been used as weapons of war at times, right? Tell us some examples of those. __EOS__ They have, yeah. I was really surprised by this. They have been used in a lot of really interesting ways. So there are ancient examples of bugs being used as war, you know, like the Greeks or the Romans filling up a hive with angry hornets or with scorpions and lobbing it at their enemies. ",0
52323," I want you to help us hear Jimi Hendrix differently, because you're right. When we think of Hendrix, we hear those signature sounds, the feedback, the whaling high notes and those bends in the low notes. But what do you hear, not as a fan but as a composer? __EOS__ Yeah, and that happened as I got older. When I was a youngster growing up, I heard just the sheer audacity of it and it spoke to my teenage heart. And as I got older, of course, I got attracted to other styles of music, especially jazz and classical music, composition, and started integrating everything. __EOS__ Now, you've mostly drawn from ""Electric Lady Land,"" that particular Hendrix album. And I'm wondering why that one really spoke to you in terms of translating it for the quartet. __EOS__ To me, that was his magnum opus. ",2
52324,"  You know, the smoking evolution... __EOS__ The band Kitty, Daisy and Lewis. They spoke with us from the BBC studios in London. Their album, ""Smoking in Heaven,"" is out now. Thank you, guys, so much for talking with us. __EOS__ Thank you very much. __EOS__ This is NPR's WEEKEND EDITION. ",2
52325," No. We went to Hebrew school five days a week. __EOS__ Oh yeah, and Sunday morning as well. __EOS__ Yeah __EOS__ Yeah ",1
52326," It was 3 o'clock one morning in 1964, on the eve of the highest holiday in the Tibetan calendar. Renowned religion scholar Huston Smith awoke in a monastery in the foothills of the Indian Himalayas. __EOS__ There fell upon my ear the holiest sound I have ever heard. __EOS__ Professor Smith is a man who knows from holy. He was raised in China by missionaries and wrote the classic textbook ""The World's Religions."" But despite a lifetime of research, Smith says he was shocked and exalted at this sound. __EOS__ So much so that he went back to the monastery three years later with Voice of America engineers, and made a recording. ",2
52327," If you're just joining us, my guest is Spike Jonze, and he co-wrote and directed the new movie adaptation of the Maurice Sendak children's classic ""Where the Wild Things Are."" He also directed the movies ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" and a whole lot of rock videos. __EOS__ Yeah, we did. We did - probably for about a year we did casting in all the big cities around the country and we found, you know, amazing kids - like some kids that got, that we were really close to casting, actually. But we realized what we'd written and basically the role we'd written for Max in the movie was a really complicated, challenging role, and the level of performance that we were looking for and the range of performance that we were looking for, we started to realize like we were looking for like an eight-year-old Sean Penn or Daniel Day-Lewis. __EOS__ Let me stop you a second. What did he film him doing if he'd never acted before? What was the tape like? __EOS__ The tape - I think the initial tape was reading the scenes a couple times. It wasn't like a real in-depth audition. It was reading a couple scenes and then just having him run around. And I think he had him like take a plastic sword and sneak out into the backyard and attack his parents. ",1
52328," Yeah. Mr. Potter, is Romanee-Conti, if anything, even a little more precious today?__EOS__ Well, you know, every year, Burgundy as a region - the prices are going up and up and up, unlike Bordeaux by the way. In terms of a more existential value, in Burgundy, in France and with oenophiles around the world, I think there's a renewed appreciation for what it represents and for the philosophies and spirituality and tenderness and care and history that are all tangled in the vines of Romanee-Conti.__EOS__ And to be absolutely plain, if you have some, you don't like mix it with club soda, right?__EOS__ No, you want to drink that straight.",0
52329," You managed to, like, give birth in between deployments. You planned it well. But then your husband would leave. And you raised, you know - many of the years when you raised your three children you were virtually a single mother at home.__EOS__ Right. Right. Yeah, and that was tough. And when the kids were babies, I would remind myself that they wouldn't remember those deployments. So it wasn't really kind of fundamentally changing them and how they grew up. But as they got older, this last deployment - our oldest son, Jack, was - his name is Joe in the book - he was in sixth grade. So he was just getting to the point where he really missed his dad. And he was angry that his dad was gone because he knew that his dad had volunteered for that last year in Afghanistan and that he didn't have to go. So that was - you know, it's a really weird mix of pride and also some anger, too.__EOS__ A feeling of rejection or of second-place-ness?__EOS__ Second-place-ness, yes. Yes, definitely a feeling of being the second priority. And we knew we weren't. And we discussed it as a couple, you know, about him going back. But we also knew that there was a price to pay with how much he would miss with our kids. There's a lot of - most of the Army couples that I'm familiar with, most of our close friends, the mom is the disciplinarian. So went the dad is back from the deployments, he's like, oh, let's just break all the rules. Let's just eat chips on the couch and do all these crazy things. And that's me. I'm the, dad's gone - let's eat chips on the couch. So when he's deployed, I just kind of have this attitude of, listen, guys. Get good grades. Be respectful, and the world is your oyster. You can do whatever you want. I don't - you can watch TV. You can play outside. You can - you know, just get these things, just meet these basic requirements and the rest of it is up to you. So when Darrin's back, there's a lot more - each day is structured. For example, the other day when your producer called and I talked to him, he said - I think he said something like, where's your husband and your kids right now? And I laughed to myself because they were on a four-and-a-half hour death march around Lake Michigan.",0
52330,"  Well, from parents who are involved, I hear support for      teachers, which was really contrasting with--contrast it with the--I      think it was Newsweek or Time cover that said, `What teachers hate about      parents.'  And what I'm finding is that that's a false animosity there,      that parents really want to be involved, and teachers want parents      involved, and they're both trying to figure out ways to do that. __EOS__  Well, just take us back in time for a moment when you were a      boy, and you realized that education was important to you. __EOS__  It came a little bit later in life after much      resistance, as most students tend to resist parents who push them.  But      my mom had a fifth grade education.  She was a sharecropper's daughter      who got pulled out of class and put in the fields of South Carolina to      work tobacco.  Well, OK, flash-forward, she has a kid.  Circumstances are      kind of tough in DC at the time, growing up, but she realized the      opportunity for me, if I had the foundation she didn't have, and while      her education stopped at fifth grade, I could almost pinpoint it was in      my fifth grade that she kicked into overdrive and really pushed and      really made a point that, `You're going to go beyond where I did, and      you're going to achieve something.  I don't know what it is, but it's      going to be more than what I've got.' __EOS__  There are--let me just jump in here--many, many parents who do      a terrible job of interacting with the school system.  But if you had to      assign some responsibility to the school system, to the kids, to the      parents, how much... ",3
52331," Yeah, absolutely. This is a guy who, when you read the documents that the U.S. has released from Guantanamo, they're always very skeptical and very suspicious of him. And yet nevertheless, they turned him over to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia put him through this rehabilitation program. At the end, they asked him if he wanted a wife. He said no.__EOS__ Yeah, well, let's talk about that. First of all, the formation of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula pretty much coincides with the inauguration of President Obama.__EOS__ Absolutely, in fact there was a young Yemeni journalist, and the leader of AQAP had sort of put out a lot of feelers to different journalists, different Yemeni journalists there in Sana'a. I talked to several of them in researching the book. And basically he did what someone in the West would do  He promised an exclusive interview.__EOS__ How direct an impact do you think that that video had, and the presence of former Gitmo detainees in AQAP - how direct an impact do you think that had on President Obama's inability to follow through on his promise to sign a directive closing Gitmo?",0
52332," Oh, I think there's all kinds of theological backwaters of the Catholic Church that you embrace when you're a kid - the lives of the saints, the virgin birth, all the rest - that you become more skeptical about when you're grown up. I mean I grew up with the notion that father was as close to God as you got on Earth. Obviously I don't really believe that anymore.__EOS__ Did you ever want to be a nun?__EOS__ I think if I wanted anything, I wanted to be a priest.__EOS__ That's part of the reason why you're not in the church anymore.",3
52333," Rice is sitting in the offices of the Advancement Project, a nonprofit she co-founded to address barriers to opportunity. Her windows in the Echo Park neighborhood have sweeping views of where poor, mostly immigrant L.A. meets hipster L.A. After the riots, Rice bluntly told city leaders what would happen if the city's poor neighborhoods continued to be ignored by its better-off residents.__EOS__ Understand that if we leave these children trapped in these Petri dishes from hell  where they can't learn, they're exposed to violence, they're exposed into gangs, and the gangs run things, guess what, ladies and gentlemen? That threat is going to come out of those communities, like a cat out of a bag, at us.__EOS__ That obligation to ensure the entire community's well-being was something that was drummed into Rice from birth. Her parents believed education would be a potent weapon in the fight for equality.__EOS__ You learned three words by the time you were one and a half or two. The first one was mommy. The second one was daddy. And the third word was college.",0
52334," Well, he was beleaguered. He was becoming unwelcome in England, where he was living. He was worried about suits and criminal charges that were being filed in various countries in the world, and in that state he decided the best place for him was on the high seas. So he recruited a number of his younger members and formed an organization called the Sea Org or Sea Organization. It was - it became the clergy, but originally it was just his crew, and he had this small Scientology armada that sailed primarily in the Mediterranean and later in the Caribbean. And he spent about eight years at sea going from port to port, more or less just drifting.__EOS__ So was he at sea for legal reasons?__EOS__ In part. He was evading process servers. He was also on the lookout for a couple of things. One, he wanted to take over a country. He had in mind that Scientology needed a home - and he was searching for that home. At one point he thought about Rhodesia, and then Morocco was a very promising place and he sent Scientologists into Morocco to infiltrate the government and make themselves friendly with the security agencies. And they actually came very close to being involved in a coup against the king. The Scientologists were present at an attempt to kill the king at a military parade and shortly after that Scientologists were made unwelcome in Morocco. He told another person that Russia might be a good place for Scientology to take over, so he was always on the patrol for that.__EOS__ So at some point he decides to come back to land. He needs a safe place to be and a place where Scientology can flourish and he chooses Clearwater, Florida. Why Clearwater?",0
52335," I had nothing to do with it. This is Adam Horowitz. __EOS__ It just seemed like it was a funny idea at the time. It was literally like we thought we were probably just going to play a handful of gigs. You know, all our friends were in bands. Everybody was in bands. You just, like, used to throw together a band and like write a couple songs, play a couple shows, and you're done. __EOS__ I mean, also part of the fun of being in a band was coming up with the stupidest name you could think of. __EOS__ Like my band New Wave Old Hat. ",3
52336," But really, you wanted a dog.__EOS__ I really wanted a dog. When my sister and I were kids, my sister, from the time she was a little girl, was obsessed with hyper-realistic looking baby dolls. And I would say hyper-realistic looking baby doll are to this day the one thing that just completely creeps me out. And I always wanted stuffed dogs, that was it. My sister went on and had a couple of babies, I went on and had a couple of dogs.__EOS__ Do you know why you never wanted to have children?__EOS__ No. But here's my analogy to it. People would say to me - and I will tell you the best thing about being 50 is nobody asks me anymore and I'm so grateful for that.",0
52337," True enough.__EOS__ So to sit there and pretend like there's this massive, you know, conspiracy of voter fraud going on it's, you know, it's a fallacy and it's insulting. I mean, I would have more respect for them if they would just say this is just like how, you know, when a majority party gets into office and they do redistricting. It's just a way to try to rig, you know, the election more so in your favor.__EOS__ Well, what do you think Bridget? Obviously, there's - civil rights groups have already - filing lawsuits. That has happened in many other states. They say this discriminates against people of color. What do you think of that argument?__EOS__ Right, and that's, you know, important to look at - the Supreme Court ruling and it still left the ability for people who do not agree with the laws to, A, either vote against them if they're on a general ballot, or file a lawsuit against them...",3
52338," I mean, you mentioned that in the book. I just think it's nuts. .__EOS__ Maybe in a masochistic way. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I didn't really - I guess ego-wise, I didn't want some other actor sitting there in the second row during every rehearsal, just kind of watching me, taking notes. That would've freaked me out. But more so, I - you know, when you put your name above the title of a show that's essentially a one-person show, people are coming to see you do that part. And so if you sit down, and you have a little piece of paper in your playbill that says, tonight, the role of Hedwig will be played by somebody else. It just - it didn't seem right.__EOS__ My guest is Neil Patrick Harris. He's written the new memoir. More after a break, this is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Neil Patrick Harris. And he has a new memoir called ""Choose Your Own Autobiography.""

Bartok's mother attacked her and tried to slit her throat. Bartok couldn't get her institutionalized or have a legal guardian appointed to make decisions on her mother's behalf. __EOS__ I think it probably was, first, my sister's idea. My sister was in school - graduate school at the time  when the policeman made that suggestion to me. She knew that she was going to be out looking for professional jobs, you know, teaching English at a university and there was no way she was going to have our mother show up and - in her classroom and, you know, she didn't want to lose her job. I think it was my sister's idea, but you know, definitely the policeman, after he said it, I immediately got an unpublished phone number and wrote my mother a letter saying that I had moved, but I actually hadn't. This was before she ended up becoming homeless but it was very close to that time. __EOS__ So you changed your last name to Bartok after Bela Bartok, the composer. __EOS__ Yes. ",0
52340," One on one, Fernandes is personable. She's got a vision for the future of a diverse Gallaudet with higher academic achievement. But she has made lots of enemies since she arrived as an administrator more than a decade ago. She shook up departments, sometimes pushing out longtime staff members.__EOS__  I'm sure that if I was a man they would say, oh, he's a tough leader making hard decisions. And if I were a man, they would say, oh, he's obliviously very busy so he doesn't have time to, you know, be smiling all the time and talking with every person on the campus. Because I'm a woman, I'm sure that some of this does involve gender discrimination issues.__EOS__ But that's not all she's got to deal with. A majority of the faculty voted for a resolution calling on her to resign. And students keep taking over buildings and blocking most of the gates to the campus. Fernandes says she's prepared to be president and always see protesters outside her office window. But members of the board of trustees will have to decide if that's the future they want for Gallaudet.__EOS__ And you can read varying perspectives on the Gallaudet controversy.

52342," Hmm. That's an interesting question. I'm personally, I'm not interested in believing as a concept, but in understanding and trying to understand. So for instance, if you ask me if I believe in supernatural, I will tell you no, I don't believe in supernatural because I don't think that nature can transcend itself. I don't think that nature can be transcended either. Even the unexplainable has to live inside those margins. But if you ask me about paranormal, for instance, I would consider paranormal like a group of phenomenon in the search of an explanation, well, there are a couple of things out there that cannot be explained yet because we don't have the tools yet.__EOS__ So speaking about reality, the reviews of the films have been mixed. There's been a lot of comparison to your first English-language film, ""Buried,"" which was sort of a darling back at Sundance in 2010. So how much attention do you as a filmmaker pay to the issue of reviews and who's talking about it and this and that?__EOS__ You're actually try not to pay attention and I actually try not to - even when I read very, very good reviews because they used to be smoke in a way. When you release a film for a couple of months it becomes a kind of hamburger and everybody has something to say and it has to be now and definitive and as high tone as possible. And in a way after doing a unique film like ""Buried,"" when I say unique I don't stay good or bad, I say one-of-a-kind, in the sense that it's a guy inside a box for an hour and a half, you know that you're going to hear things afterwards.__EOS__ you can do another film backwards and everybody will tell you that you are repeating yourself or you can do it the conventional way and probably a couple of people will tell you that they prefer the other one. So you simply can focus on what you want to do trying to get it as close as what you have in your head as possible because opinions constantly change and in a way films become real films two years later.",1

And by the way, anyone who wants to be a writer out there, the first thing you have to have growing up is asthma.__EOS__ So I recommend growing up in a place like Leningrad, which was built over a swamp, which will be very conducive to your not breathing. So here is what happens and one of the main reasons we did leave Russia.  Unbeknownst to me, my mother was in the middle of a crisis herself, wondering whether to stay behind with my sick grandmother in Russia or leave her behind forever and emigrate to America. The decision was made for her in a greasy Crimean cafeteria.

Is the death penalty generally on decline in the United States? __EOS__ It is being used much less than it had been. There's been a 60 percent decline in death sentences over the past seven years. About a 50 percent decline in executions, smaller death row. Actually, fewer states now have the death penalty and public support still is about two-thirds in favor but less than it had been in the 1990s. __EOS__ So what's going on? Why the decline? ",3

Yeah, I think - I was living in New York during 9/11, and I was sort of eager to respond to it in some way. And I think, you know, seeing Bush in his flight suit, or Kerry running on his war record, or The Terminator being elected governor of California, it did seem that we wanted our leaders to be heroes more than ever, you know.

Did you see much of that?__EOS__ Yes, that happens, particularly with Huntington's disease, and one concern is that as we go forward, as more and more people are tested - and soon when you walk into your doctor's office, at some point in the near future, your whole genome will be tested. And so we'll each know information or have the possibility of knowing information about our mutations.__EOS__ Do you really see that coming?__EOS__ I do. And for several reasons. One is the cost of sequencing the three billion letters that make each of us, the three billion molecular letters, has gone from - 10 years ago it was $10 billion, then it went to $1 billion to $1 million, and now it's only a few hundred dollars.

And he died in a PTSD clinic of an overdose of fentanyl, which is a very, very powerful painkiller.__EOS__ And if I understand correctly, nobody knows for sure whether that was an intentional overdose or an accidental one.__EOS__ It's not really clear. But what is clear is that like many of the wounded, he volunteered to serve his country, went to a distant place, got blown up, came back and for a variety of reasons did not get the care that he needed.

Why salt and pepper? Why not salt and cinnamon, or pepper or cardamom, or some other combination of spices? What is it that we have that makes us so attached to these two particular spices?__EOS__ So can you give us a sense - since your home is kind of the framework for this, I must say, wide-ranging - you do go far from your house here in going through history and so forth. But tell us a bit about the rectory as our starting point, here.__EOS__ Well, you know, I mean, I used it as a kind of launch pad. I mean, I took this - my starting assumption was that people are not that interested in my house and in my life. So I just used it as a kind of convenient floor plan.",0
52367," And all the more reason why I think a lot of people might - somebody who you were personally close to, care a lot about, seeing that person injured, you might freeze. And for you to run toward the chaos, as opposed to away from it, is something that I think a lot of people are very moved and impressed by. Do you have any recollection of what was going through your mind?__EOS__ I think the detachment that I can have emotionally kind of allows me to have a better view of everything that happens. So when I heard the gunshots, I knew she would likely be the target, but probably not the only victim, because I'm sure that whoever the shooter was would be shooting indiscriminately once they started.__EOS__ Well, it's been quite a couple of days, just awful situation on Saturday. And then here you are, a couple of days later, she survived and you're sitting next to the president and her husband, and it's just been a quite a couple of days. And I'm just wondering how you're taking it all in.__EOS__ It's absolutely surreal to go from such great sadness and loss to kind of, as a community and as a nation, move forward in our grieving process, because last night was absolutely a great step forward in bringing everyone together. So it was absolutely surreal. Because not only was I there with the president of the United States, but I was sitting next to people whom I've admired for years and that I never thought I'd have the opportunity to meet, let alone to talk in front of, like Sandra Day O'Connor, Nancy Pelosi, both of the senators from Arizona.

But like most men of the time, he didn't do very much, apart from the traditional winning of bread. He didn't take me to get my hair cut or my teeth cleaned. He didn't make the appointments. He didn't shop for my clothes. He didn't make my breakfast, lunch or dinner.

He said the census issue was a catalyst but not the major issue. I think what Senator Gregg probably saw was an inability to - and this is really what he said - an inability to be himself in that job.

Those who were initiated, it was like an acknowledgement and those who weren't, it was sort of like a sign to come in and join us.__EOS__ The song One Love went through a number of changes over the years.

The version of One Love that became an international hit was subtitled People Get Ready, a tribute to the Curtis Mayfield song. Again author Christopher John Farley.__EOS__ The first version of One Love is a version that really is local. In this final version, it's a song that's really aimed at the entire globe. He's not just playing to Jamaicans anymore, he's not just playing to Kingstonians, he's playing to mankind and it shows how big his music had become, how ambitious he'd become as a musician and it's captured in that song One Love.",2

Why did ""Take Five"" become such a classic? __EOS__ You know, the public demanded, after they heard it, and the disc jockeys said the board would be lighting up. What is that?

So now, yeah. I think if people continue to embrace the film as early audiences do, I think it's going to be a signature in a lot of peoples' lives.

As you look back on the world as you knew it in the late 20th century, what do you think has come about in the changes that we've seen - so many changes - just in the past year or so?__EOS__ Mm-hmm. That's a difficult question to answer. Overall, I think we're moving closer to an awareness of the realities of life in the region. And that's a good sign. Um, fewer distractions, more realities.",0
52380," One of the parallels between FDR and Obama is that FDR had some of his New Deal legislation overturned by the Supreme Court declaring it unconstitutional. And I know there are many Republicans who would like to see, for instance, health care reform be challenged in the Supreme Court and be overturned by the Supreme Court, same with some financial regulation and environmental regulation. Can you talk about the parallels you see? __EOS__ Absolutely. I think what you had in the 1930s, what President Roosevelt confronted was the reality that he could pass many things - much more freely than President Obama is going to be able to in this environment. But he could pass all manner of legislation. He had big majorities in both houses of Congress. But ultimately, he had to run the gauntlet of the Supreme Court, that these big changes in government and in the economy would have to be ratified by the third branch of government. And that's very much true today. __EOS__ FDR opposed the aging court. You said in 1937 the average age of a Supreme Court justice was 71. And so Roosevelt's plan was to add a younger justice for every justice over 70 who hadn't retired. Now, it's the liberal justices who are the older justices. Best example being Justice Stevens, who's turning 90 later this month and, of course, just announced his plan to retire and will soon be replaced. So I just find that kind of an ironic twist. __EOS__ It is an ironic twist and I think that it also points up some of the problems with Roosevelt's argument, that age does not define ideology. And even though Roosevelt looked at what he called the nine old men of the Supreme Court and suggested that the older justices were falling out of touch with reality, the oldest justice on that court in the 1930s was Brandeis, the great liberal justice. And this was pointed out with glee by many of Roosevelt's appointments. How can you tar all of the old justices with the same brush, they said, and when the oldest on the court is Brandeis? ",0

52383," Cumberbatch is the one freaky touch in an otherwise conventional movie. But those conventions, in this case, work handsomely. Graham Moore's script is smart and shapely, the direction, by Morton Tyldum, brisk.

Did you work with them on that? __EOS__ No. I didn't direct that scene much. I didn't direct that scene really. By that time in the shooting schedule, both Rod and Marlon knew what they had.

So I just took the petition around to my hippie friends, and they signed it, and all of a sudden I was on the ballot, and before you knew it, I was elected, and within eight or nine months both the principal and the vice principal turned in their resignations.  __EOS__ You had already been elected, though, and were going to your graduation, where you intended to cause some trouble with the speech you'd been chosen to give. But there was a moment where - well, you tell us about it.  __EOS__ Yeah, this was actually - this was one of those - you know, when you think back to those pivotal moments, where you're trying to figure out how did I get here, and sometimes they aren't big things that happen in your life.

And then she sort of mentioned, like, oh, in my own experience, you know, how I ended up doing this is that I had lost three children of my own to AIDS in the time before this treatment was available in Africa. __EOS__ There's a little girl that you feature. Her name is Bwalya. ",1
52391," Yes. They do say that. I mean, my position on that is suffering is suffering. Quadriplegia is a fact. A history of child abuse is a fact. But suffering is suffering.

Thou has fulfilled the judgment of the wicked. __EOS__ Wow, you've just killed this guy, and you're praising God that thou has fulfilled the judgment of the wicked. You say, about this agent who you've just killed, that there's a darkness in his soul. And of course, that really describes your character. There is a real darkness in your soul. __EOS__ Yes, well, I think with Van Alden, probably like most people, his problems began in childhood. I imagine him coming from a very strict background, probably not a very compassionate background. I imagine his father being somewhat of an ogre and maybe even, you know, physically abusing him from time to time. And so that's kind of the seed of what grows into the adult Van Alden. __EOS__ How do you prepare for a scene like that, where you at such a point of self-delusion that you really feel like you've done God's work in trying to baptize this man and then killing him? ",3
52393,"  Well, I think that those musics that you mentioned, Afro-beat, kind of a 70s funky sound, all that stuff is very much a touchstone for the band when were getting started. But I think, as we've spent more time playing together and touring and recording more together, I think that the band has just sort of kind of tried to focus on the elements that, you know, are maybe unique to the band.  I think we're just more comfortable being ourselves. __EOS__  Change has been real constant with the band from the beginning.  I read that you had over 70 musicians over the last five years that have either played on albums or sat in with you on performances.  How did the whole NOMO, I guess, its collective, really, how did it start? __EOS__  It started as sort of a very loose assembly.  We were at this great big house in Ann Arbor with a big basement that's appropriate for band practices and late night dance parties and the like. And it was sort of an open call to any of our musician friends, and so we were having 15 people kind of come over and have these sort of unruly raucous sessions. But we're really fortunate that the kind of core eight members who tour with the band have pretty much been there right from the beginning. __EOS__  Is there a unifying vision for the kind of music the eight members like?  I mean, I hear, obviously, the funk and a little bit of Afro-beat in there, but we also hear the wall of horns, this Motown sound. ",2
52394,"  Paul and Silas bound in jail. Had no money for to go their bail. Keep your eyes on the prize and hold on. __EOS__ I would take something like the Eyes on the Prize and I would say, okay, well who's, you know, who's telling the story? And I would find that guy and, you know, and so like the first verse would be, you know, you're walking down the street and somebody kind of collars you from an, you know, from an alley or something, and says that Paul and Silas bound in jail, had no money for to go their bail. Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on. So somebody is telling you a secret, is warning you that something is up. I think that's all in that first verse, you know. So that was, that was my in to that music. You know, it was, I felt like, I know whose voice this is. __EOS__ I'm going to board that big Greyhound. __EOS__ I use that verse, I'm going to board that big Greyhound. Carry me from town to town.

52395," Yeah. I think e-books are terrific in their own right. I love being able to get on a plane and basically carry around seven books and it weighs 10 ounces. But what about your kids? Remember your kids. And one of the bad things that's going on with e-books now is people used to go into the bookstore and they would think about their kids and they would maybe buy a book for their kids. Now they go on e-books and we haven't figured out how to deal with e-books in terms of our children; how many readers should there be in the house - e-book readers - and how do I deal with, you know, how many e-books my kids should be able to buy or however they - so, it's not happening. So, like, with my adult books, in the beginning, the first four or five weeks, it's about 60 percent e-books. With the kid books, it's like 5 percent. And the tragedy there is less and less adults are getting books for their kids, wherever they get books.__EOS__ Do you have a set number of words you try and write every day?__EOS__ No, no. I just - it's always - to me, it's just the joy of storytelling. And I don't think about it. Getting things in on time has never been a problem for me, so I don't worry about it. You know, I remember watching Morgan Freeman when he did the two Alex Cross movies. And he's so confident that he's going to knock the scene dead, and I'm really confident that I can tell a good story now, so I just don't worry about things.__EOS__ James Patterson.

He directed the new film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. __EOS__ If youre just joining us, our guest is film director Edgar Wright. His new film is Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. __EOS__ That film is really like a love-hate letter to London in a way because we both lived in the city and its about a character stuck in a rut, but theres also a feeling  and the center joke of the film is it was not entirely clear in London which members of the city were living or dead.

52398," It absolutely does. I've actually shared it. I work - I used to work in the mental health field and shared it with a rehab facility with women who are recovering from drug and alcohol addiction. And we found that doing that type of creative outlet not only helped them deal with the issues they were dealing with but when they had family members come visit them, it was an opportunity for them to connect by doing those types of creative drawing, doodling, painting together. And it really helped strengthen or rebuild those relationships. __EOS__ That's right. __EOS__ This email to this point from Sarah in Tennessee. I'm a customer service rep. I bought a special notebook to draw my words when I'm angry at customers. __EOS__ And it relieves the stress. ",0
52399," That's the late Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Many Americans got their first introduction to Khan's haunting voice in the film ""Dead Man Walking,"" and it was Khan who introduced a new generation of Pakistanis and Pakistani-Americans to their own traditional music. __EOS__ I still remember buying my first album. I was eight and living in Islamabad, and it was a bootleg cassette that opened with a guitar riff, and then came that voice. __EOS__ In moments, his voice could be, like, smooth like honey, and then in other moments, that same voice takes on a texture and a kind of coarseness. It's very gripping. __EOS__ Zareena Grewal grew up in a Pakistani family in the suburbs of Detroit. She now teaches religion at Yale. ",2
52400," Well, then it was completely accurate, because so many of the other elements were just - popped out as being almost within a few years of that moment in time.__EOS__ Yes. I kept switching back between '93 and '94 because I really wanted to get a ""Friends"" joke in there, but ""Friends"" hadn't come out. But I really did want it to be before the Internet as we know it existed, and before cell phones were widely used.__EOS__ Well, let's play a clip of tape here just from the movie.__EOS__  You know, it's the '90s, George. You're going to have to get with the times.",1
52401," I actually - I tried to be honest with him. I said, you know, I'm sure I probably have - I have probably lied to you, but I, usually I try and tell you the truth. Usually if I lie it's because I'm afraid you're going to be upset and - but I really do try and tell you the truth because I think kids know when you're lying to them, which is really what I think, you know? __EOS__ Well, we hope you and Josh have a - and the rest of your family have a great Thanksgiving. __EOS__ Well, thank you. And you too. __EOS__ All right, Sarah. ",3
52402," Well, in fact, people have thought about farming algae for decades, growing it up, then harvesting it, then extracting the fatty material - or the hydrocarbons - to make fuels. We've engineered the algae to just continuously pump these important precursors to fuel molecules out in a pure form. So it changes it from farming to bioreactors, which have the potential for continuous production and a much greater scalability factor. __EOS__ What are your concerns, sir? That is, if you were to create tracks of brackish waters filled with algae that is being grown for fuel, might there be an impact on the environment that we're not thinking about at first? __EOS__ Well, part of what we're doing, and the initial phases here in La Jolla, we're building a totally new greenhouse facility to, in fact, test whether open ponds, open tracks, as you described them, or closed bioreactors are going to be the most efficient way for scaling up to the scale that needs to be done. __EOS__ Well, from your time at Synthetic Genomics, you're a veteran of a major scientific race. Given reasonably good fortune and success but assuming some setbacks, how much of a time frame do you think is realistic - to think of going from where we are now to having fuel out there in the market that's been generated from algae? ",3
52403," Well, I don't know if you really have a concrete number of how much money you were making. Sometimes it was really good, and it was fantastic. I mean, I did pretty well, which made it more difficult for me because at the time, people in the street were making more than rappers, you know. I didn't - not until the big deals of Master P and Puff - deal with Badboy, with Arista Records, were people getting really big deals.__EOS__ Jay-Z speaking with Terry Gross last year.

52406," So your novel is called ""Man in the Woods"" and one the character says, guys get into the woods. We go back to our elemental selves and stuff happens. And then he says, men do what men do. We're just part of the scheme of things. We're just nature. And after reading that, I read a piece that you wrote for O Magazine - Oprah's magazine in May of 2008, and you wrote in that, the simple truth is that men are somewhat violent, even those of us who abhor violence. Even if we are cerebral, out of shape, blind in one eye, many of us expect of ourselves levels of daring and aggression that would quite frankly horrify most women, if it didn't reduce them to helpless laughter. __EOS__ I do believe that. I do also want to say that I'm not terribly out of shape or blind in one eye, so I just want to make that clear. __EOS__ Okay. __EOS__ But I think that men have an acceptance of violence - acceptance of the validity of violence. I think that, I mean I believe that if a man is walking down the street and some stranger comes up and smacks him in the back of the head, and if the man who is smacked in the back of the head just, you know, says ow, and, you know, continues to walk on and doesnt do something about it, his greatest grudge will be against himself at that point. He won't say what was wrong with that crazy guy who just came up to me for no reason and smacked me in the back of the head. He'll ask, what was wrong with me that I didnt respond in kind? And I do think that that is gender specific. ",0

52409," So you were 10 when your mother died. Did you understand death then? __EOS__ Probably not. And again, this is in the Midwest in the early, early '80s. This was not exactly the - there wasnt a lot of therapy happening back then. I was given a book - literally given a book that said what to do when a parent dies, which I dutifully read. And it didnt really help. It was sort of like I would really just have my mom back than have to read about other kids that lost their parents. But no, its a - it was, you know, it's a tough thing to take at that age. And I dont think I really got over that for quite some time. __EOS__ Did anybody sit down and try to explain to you what death meant? __EOS__ You know, there were sort of like these awkward conversations with my sisters or my dad or somebody, and that's why I would always kind of be like I understand it and I get it. And then they would get super emotional and because they obviously felt it at a, you know, super deep level. And so then I would just get bummed out that they got bummed out trying to explain to me this situation that sucked anyway. You know, it was kind of like, well, why are we even talking this if it's going to make you sad and it's going to make me sad and it's going to make everybody sad? Like, we all kind of get it, right? Let's just move on, which was probably not the most healthy attitude to have at 10. But, yeah, it's not fun. I dont wish it on anybody. ",1
52410," He knows the terms touchdown and ball. __EOS__ Which I'm pretty sure are golfing terms. __EOS__ You know, in the movie ""Big Fan,"" you know, Paul, the main character, Patton Oswalt's character, he works in a garage, but he defines himself by his love of football and of the Giants, but also he's Paul from Staten Island. He's the guy who calls into the station, and this is who he is. He's Paul from Staten Island, the guy who calls in to the sports talk show. And when he calls in, he writes down on a yellow pad what he wants to say, and he either reads it, or at least he refers to it during the call. And I thought that that was so perfect, that this caller, like he pretends like it's all being improvised, but this so defines who he is that he has to get it exactly right. I mean, it's his work. It's his - like, it's his thing. __EOS__ Yeah. He does it partially as a crutch, I think, because he's afraid he'll forget what he wants to say, or he'll think of - you know, he's locked in this parking booth all day with nothing but his thoughts, and he thinks of all these great things to say, and I think he just has to write them down because he's afraid he's going to forget it. And then it's even more than that, it's his art, you know. It's - this is what he was kind of meant to do. ",1
52411," That's right, and he went across eight times, he danced, he lay down, and he actually ran across the wire at a certain time. But what I was most interested in was not so much Philippe Petit, but the people who were on the ground, the people who walk this sort of little tightrope of our ordinary everyday moments. Trying to capture the music of a city and trying to capture the music - the intimate human music of our lives, whether you be, you know, an Irish monk living in the Bronx or a Park Avenue mother who's lost her son to Vietnam or - one of the characters also, she's a prostitute in the Bronx in the '70s, so they were the characters that interested me. And it seems to me at a certain stage that we're all tightrope walkers. __EOS__ And these are all characters who were alive on that day in 1974 who may have witnessed the tightrope walking escapade, who may have read about it in the newspaper, who may have died on the same day even as the tight rope walker did not. In some way their lives relate to that event. __EOS__ Exactly. I was interested in looking at what the dilemmas of their life happened to be and what sort of moments that they found. And in fact, not everybody is, you know, enthralled in the novel with the idea of the tightrope walker. Some people, they look up into the sky and they see a man there on a wire and why does he cheapen death, like, by making it so easy and accessible. So there are all sorts of ways to look at a story. __EOS__ May I point you to a little bit of text that I wonder if in a powerful way plays a trick on me. One of the main characters is talking about prostitutes that he knows and explains their behavior by saying they're all throbbing with fear, we all are. And then he goes on to describe the way fear exists in our lives. And I wonder if you could read for me the next paragraph. Starting with bits of it floating in the air. ",0

The band had a huge influence on alternative music, all behind its lead singer, Perry Farrell. __EOS__ We were able to break through - then, a very sluggish and stale scene.

All you fellows who have someone and you really care. __EOS__  Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, welcome to Fresh Air.  Now, Leon Huff, was that you on the piano at the very beginning? __EOS__  Yes. ",2
52420," Sure, yeah, because I was among the first - the group of young people accepted by college after the Cultural Revolution. That means for more than a decade there had been no students accepted through the entrance exams. That also means in the society all kinds of patterns had to be accumulating. And so, there were all kinds of people who were very knowledgeable. And for instance, in my grade, there was a student who wouldn't go to English classes. He just stayed in bed reading Charles Dickens and whereas like people like myself, we just knew a few words of the language. __EOS__ You didn't realize how far behind you were until you got there? __EOS__ I had no clue at all. And in fact, in the whole year, there were five classes so people were divided into five levels. And for me, the humiliation was that for five years, I stayed at the lowest level. __EOS__ How did you manage to get into an American doctoral program, starting so far behind and having to sweat so hard just to manage the basics?

52421," So that's ""There's a Place"" from the just released volume two of ""The Beatles at the BBC."" My guest, Kevin Howlett, is the person who found these recordings because they had to be found, the BBC didn't keep them, sadly.__EOS__ And now he also has a new book called ""The Beatles  The BBC Archives, 1962-1970."" Well, here's another example of the energy that they get in these performances, and I'm actually surprised I'm playing this because this song was really not in my top 10 of, like, Beatles recordings. But I just love the way they do it live on the BBC.__EOS__ Well, ""Please Mr. Postman"" they did a few times at the BBC. The very first time they did it was in their first ever broadcast on the BBC in March 1962. And I think when they performed it for a program called ""Teenagers Turn,"" here we go, that sums up the attitude of the BBC at that point, that was probably the first time that anybody in the U.K. had heard ""Please Mr. Postman.""__EOS__ OK, so here's The Beatles at the BBC from volume two of ""The Beatles Live at the BBC,"" 1963.",2
52422," Can we hope that this was a defensive weapon and not an offensive weapon?__EOS__ Yeah, I wasn't - I wasn't going out of my way to harm people verbally. I was just a defensive player.__EOS__ OK. So this is a good time to - well, you were saying that one of things, your gift is kind of observational comedy, right, kind of noticing things and kind of going with that. And obviously one of the things - and I think a lot of people in this country do talk about some is race and how race plays into things.__EOS__ Now I'm going to go to the doc, you know, we're going to get you your shots. I'm coming right back. I'm your new mom.",1
52423,"  From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli. __EOS__ That song refers to the Barbary Wars of the early 1800s. Now the shores of Tripoli are seeing conflict once again. And Adrian Tinniswood argues that the U.S. can apply lessons from those clashes 200 years ago to the conflict in Libya today. Tinniswood is the author of ""Pirates of Barbary  Corsairs, Conquests and Captivity in the 17th Century Mediterranean."" He joins us from Bath in England. __EOS__ Nice to be here. __EOS__ Can you just give us a quick primer on how the U.S. became militarily involved in North Africa in the 1800s. ",0
52424," Well, hello, Neal. And hello, Troy. __EOS__ Hello. __EOS__ Troy, I've seen you performed numerous times at the New Orleans Jazz Fest since '98. We saw you with Orleans Avenue at the House of Blues. You opened up in Charlottesville for DMB a couple of times and at The Jefferson Theater.  And besides your fabulous showmanship, what impressed me most about you was your circular breathing. I was wondering if you could tell us about your circular breathing like, when did you began, and what musicians inspired you, because you've become so good at it. And how long did it take? I think I've heard you sustain that breathing for about five minutes. But how long can you sustain it for? __EOS__ And can you teach it to a radio guy? ",2
52425," .__EOS__ I'm just being honest. I had to learn everything from playing behind my back to playing with my teeth to rolling around on the ground playing. I watched all the footage and I mimicked everything to the T, just to have it in the arsenal just in case we needed it. But, you know, one of the hardest parts, I'm a right-hand guitar player, like, I'm a horrible right-hand guitar player. I wouldn't even call myself a guitar player. I just pick it up and fiddle with it every now and then. And I think any guitar player would agree with me, like, Jimi is the most comfortable looking guitar player in the world. Like, I've seen a lot of great guitarists that are probably, like, much better and, you know, much better skilled guitar players than Jimi Hendrix, but they - some players look like they're doing a task or working, you know, an instrument, like, actually putting in a lot of work, like giving a lot of effort. One thing about Jimi, he never looked like it was uncomfortable to him, ever. So one thing I was concerned about is making sure that it looked like I was playing with ease because the way he strapped it on, the way it fit on his body, it just - it was almost like it was meant for him to play. So when it came down to doing the left-hand thing, I just had to, you know, it was almost like finger choreography. It was learning where the chords are, learning the actual chords of the song with my left hand, learning where the notes are, learning how my fingers should lay. But it was really, really difficult because it's almost like walking backwards, and making walking backwards look normal.__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ That's what it was like.",1
52426," Well, the grace note that I mentioned helped me enormously because it was difficult to sort of watch him toward the end of the book. And to leave him, I think on a note with which I leave him, was essential. It wasn't essential only for the book and for Tim but for me as the writer. __EOS__ Did the ending change over time? __EOS__ The ending - actually the very ending, came to me early on, maybe halfway through the writing of the book, and I had always known that that's how I wanted to end it, but I didn't know when I would write it. And I ended up being in a Home Depot with my dad, and I wrote it on my BlackBerry because I knew exactly what I wanted to say right at that moment, when I'm always completely useless in a Home Depot. __EOS__ Which aisle were you in? ",0
52427," Oh, no, absolutely not. The chimps I study sometimes have a rough go of it. That's for sure. And one of the big problems is the, of course, habitat loss and their ecosystems being endangered. __EOS__ Sure, because they're - well, Thomas French, one of the most compelling stories you tell in the book is about a chimpanzee named Herman. __EOS__ Thanks. Herman is one of the most interesting individuals I've ever had a chance to report and write about. This chimp was born in Africa in the wild, saw his mother killed in front of him, was taken into human custody as a pet with a human family. And then when his human - and his family loved him, taught him how to eat at a table, how to put him in human clothes, treated him in many ways like a human child. __EOS__ Herman's story is told, and many other stories are told in ""Zoo Story  Life in the Garden of Captives."" Thomas French is the author and he joined us today from the studios of Georgia Public Radio in Atlanta. Thanks, Thomas French, very much. ",0
52428,"  Yes. __EOS__  You've just pulled a gun on this guy, and was he laughing      at you? __EOS__  Yes. __EOS__  Did that make you angry? ",3
52429," Well, I certainly got who they were. I don't know how much they knew about what I was all about other than, you know, the introduction. I had a hit record. Now, how much that meant and how much more they thought I could offer them, I don't know. I don't remember lots of stormy rehearsals, but that's I think due to, you know, four guys in a room and everything swimming about.__EOS__ We’ll hear more of my interview with Bob Gaudio in the second half of the show. He sang with The Four Seasons and wrote or co-wrote many of their hits. The movie “Jersey Boys” is now on DVD, and Gaudio has a recent album called ""Audio With A G  Sounds Of A Jersey Boy. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.__EOS__  Put your loving hand out baby. I'm beggin'. Beggin, put your loving hand out, baby. Beggin' you put your loving hand out darling.__EOS__ Coming up, we talk more with Bob Gaudio about The Four Seasons and the mob, his handshake agreement with Frankie Valli that’s lasted decades without any help from lawyers and why he left The Four Seasons. And of course we’ll play more music.",2
52430,"  Nothing's happening. __EOS__  You know, I don't really care which dress we get. It doesn't matter to me. I just need to get off this white carpet. __EOS__ Yeah, I mean, for us - here's the thing. And, you know, we've obviously taken both heat and kudos for that scene. But it's easy to look at that scene and just say, oh, it's just - okay, so people are throwing up and going to the bathroom. __EOS__ Right. ",1
52431," Mm-hmm. __EOS__ ...then you're committing a sin as well, because you're refusing to live up to the greatness that is inherent in you. __EOS__ We're in a pride/logic loop here. __EOS__ And I'm just proud of that. ",0
52432," Well, Kate presented this kind of a tough exterior, and you always wonder about people like that - how tough are they really? She was a private person in a lot of ways. But we knew her at AP as a good friend, in addition to being a very tough competitor. She was - she could be very funny, and she could be very crude at times in her speech, but - and people would say - they called her, you know, quiet Kate Webb. She supposed to be so quiet. In fact, Kate talked a lot, but she spoke in such low voice that it was really hard to hear her. And she's one of these people who would be talking at a table, a bunch of people, and everybody'd be leaning forward to hear what she said. They were totally engrossed in what she was saying, and actually they were just trying to hear what she was saying. __EOS__ Born in New Zealand, spent a lot of time working for newspapers in Australia, as well. __EOS__ That's correct. And then she - after Vietnam, she was around - she worked for L'Agence Presse for a time in Indonesia. At one point, she was living on a beach in Indonesia, kind of a barefoot existence out there, on her own volition. __EOS__ She - in 1971, she was captured in Cambodia along with some other journalists and held prisoner and given up for dead. At one point, her obituary was published in the New York Times. ",3
52433," Now, your book focuses on Florida tomatoes, which is where the incident that you just described took place. And you say that Florida accounts for one-third of the fresh-tomatoes raised in the U.S. And from October to June, virtually all the fresh market field-grown tomatoes in the country come from Florida. __EOS__ Right. For the last 50 or more years, tomato breeders, people who breed commercial tomato seeds, have concentrated, essentially, on one thing, Terry, and that is yield. They want plants that yield as many or as much as possible. __EOS__ Now, if the tomatoes are picked when they're green, and they're hard, and they're shipped that way to the supermarket, I mean, that would be fine if they eventually ripened and got delicious. Do they eventually turn delicious? __EOS__ Well, you know, supermarket tomatoes can speak for themselves on that point  no, in my opinion. The trouble is these green tomatoes, the industry likes to call them mature greens. And to you and I, they're simply a green tomato. And in fact to really tell the difference between a mature green tomato, which evidently will have some flavor, and a simple green green tomato, you have to cut it open, and they don't do that when they harvest. They just harvest all the tomatoes of a certain size. ",0
52434,   Here and now I promise to love      faithfully. __EOS__  Faithfully. __EOS__   You're all I need here and now. __EOS__  R&B songwriter and singer Luther Vandross died Friday at the age      of 54. ,2
52435,"  ...because he's been wrecked. __EOS__  I want to give the older horses a chance to get him some manners. __EOS__  He's run with some studs, and they take him... __EOS__  You're nuts for having that many studs... ",1
52436,"  I was thinking exactly that - that here's a peace concert. Somehow this chicken's going to get in serious trouble if it's on the stage.__EOS__ And it's got to be so juxtaposed position to what this whole concert was about that people had to hate him for doing it. And hatred is what we wanted.__EOS__ So I'm laughing because this is a hysterical story, but it really was unfair to the chicken. What happened was, Alice Cooper takes the chicken, throws it into the audience, and the audience starts tearing the chicken apart, which really sounds horrifying.__EOS__ Yeah, pretty horrifying.",1
52437," You're trying to mimic Vieux.__EOS__ Just to give him - Vieux, just to accompany him.__EOS__ Accompany, yeah.__EOS__ So it will sound organic.",2
52438, Yeah.__EOS__ That was sort of the big news.__EOS__ Yeah. It sounded like she got some money.__EOS__ Yeah.,3
52439," Thank you very much, Melissa. __EOS__ And we asked you to calculate the odds of this happening accidentally. What did you find out? __EOS__ Taking into account the frequencies of the letters that appear in this particular message, I compute that the odds of this happening by accident would be about 5.5 in one trillion. __EOS__ I see. So this line from the governor's office that this was pure coincidence, sounds like you're not buying it. ",3
52440," Thank you, pleased to be with you. __EOS__ The message from the White House seems to be lets catch our breath on health care and see if the Republicans have any good ideas. Realistically speaking, is there any chance now of getting from where you are now to passing a big health care bill before the 2010 election? __EOS__ I think we will pass a big health care bill. I think the president will insist that we keep the promise. We're going to have to figure out a different route now that we dont have 60 Democrats, but the Republicans are not helping us. __EOS__ But given their solid opposition to the Senate bill, which would seem to be an easier pill to swallow than your House bill, are we talking about how hard it is to pass a bill, or rather there's not going to be a bill, lets see whose fault its going to be in the eye of the voters? ",3
52441," Well, it sounds like you two agree, so let me go on to the next question.__EOS__ This is our - 'cause I hear Karen going, no, this is so rude. OK.__EOS__ Alfonso of Los Angeles. And he wants know whether romance is dead. Here it is.__EOS__ It seems the more romantic I try to be, the worse it goes. And I've done simple gestures such as to make them Valentine's Day cards, or I plan things ahead of time, like a nice dinner. But it seems to be, I don't know, mal-interpreted on their part and it's a part of me that I've had to suppress and, you know, ultimately erase. Are the men and women of our generation more desensitized to the quote-unquote romantic? Should those people who still believe in being romantic just give up for adopting a more unromantic kind of mindset?",3
52442," That's right.__EOS__ And they have a capital city named for President Monroe as well.__EOS__ Indeed.__EOS__ In Monrovia. I remember some years ago when there were some people in Turkey who wanted the country to be called, in English, Tortia, as it is in Turkish, so that they could escape turkey jokes, jokes about the bird.",3
52443," So Orthodox Judaism operates within the parameters of Halacha of Jewish law. At Yeshiva Maharat, we do not do anything that is beyond the confines of Halacha, of the Jewish law because, like I mentioned, we do not lead services, for example. So we do not step out of that role. However, in many communities - have not had - many orthodox communities, I should say, have not had that formal position of a woman serving as the spiritual leader of that congregation. And there are certain communities and individuals who feel that that is a break from tradition, and that that is doing something new and something that orthodoxy has not had be such a common thing so far. And therefore, that that - it's a deviation from what the community has done until now.__EOS__ Do I have it right that your father is a rabbi?__EOS__ Yes, he is.__EOS__ And you're graduating on Father's Day. So, nice present for him I hope. I hope he still gets to play golf or whatever he does.",3
52444," Well, speaking of what you want to do, I want to hear a little bit, can we play something from your latest project ""Bajofondo Mar Dulce?"" __EOS__ Absolutely. __EOS__ I want to play some because well, we just like it, so we're going to play a little bit. Here it is. __EOS__ Please. ",2
52445," There's another paragraph I want you to read from your new novel, ""Lush Life."" And for people just tuning in, this is about several groups of people on the Lower East Side. There's two guys - one older, one younger - who work at a restaurant, both have aspirations to either, you know, write screenplays or be an actor. One of them is killed, mugged by a couple of kids from the project. And this is a paragraph from the point of view of the father of the boy who's killed. Would you read it for us? And set it up in any other way you want to. __EOS__ OK. Well, I mean, this is a father who, ironically, lives in Riverdale and is one of these people that are like, four steps - four generations out of the Lower East Side. And his son, who just got an MFA from Columbia, is now back obliviously in this playground of - this Montparnasse playground of Ludlow Street, and he's the kid that gets shot because he doesn't know how to respond appropriately to a gun in his face. __EOS__ I love that paragraph, and I figure that must really describe how so many parents feel when their kids reach their teens and start to become adults. And the parent still sees them as a kid, and the world sees them as a young adult. __EOS__ You know, which is fine. I mean, you can screw up every step of the way, and then you can still evolve into a better relationship with them. But all of a sudden, their life is cut short, and all you can think of is that, you know, that you can never fix this, like you probably naturally would. You never would have thought of this as being contemptuous of your own child, but you're afraid the dead child would think that you were contemptuous. You weren't giving him enough credit. I mean, it's a no issue unless there's no way to, you know, rectify the situation by just the relationship having years and years to evolve.  ",0
52446," And I would just also add, you know, we're always conscious of the fact that whatever they did to us is nothing compared to what they did to the country and particularly our service people and their families with a war that was entered into based on... __EOS__ I'm an officer in the Marine Corps. I appreciate that. __EOS__ And so we keep that all in perspective. Because at the end of the day - and you can see this with kids going out there for their third and fourth tours, and I was just out in Baghdad three weeks ago. And we owe it to them to make sure that we - we owe it to you to make sure that we never again send you to die and kill in our names without fully understanding as a nation what it is we're asking you to do and why we're asking you to do it. __EOS__ Robert...

52447," Indeed. And it's like  Say it isn't so. Say it isn't so.  And she's like,  Say it isn't so.  She finds an aspect to it and I think that's what's so wonderful about music; you can just, just find something, it doesn't have to be like fabulously unique, but something meaningful and resonating and then as soon as you do it, it's contemporary. You know what I mean? I think we have to be allowed - I guess - we have to be allowed to sing these beautiful songs and be contemporary with them, you know? Because they're just too good to say, oh well, they're old, they must die now. It's like, really?__EOS__ It brings so much happiness to me to sing them, you know, and I would hope that children when they're older would sing them. I mean if somebody stopped singing these songs, it would be pretty sad, I think. Yeah.__EOS__ OK. So do ""Can't We Be Friends"" for us.__EOS__ All right.",2
52448," Well, Otis, how important was it for you? I'm going to switch it up a little bit. Was it - how important was it for you that Mato play on this album?__EOS__ Well, it's the whole concept to the album, you know, that's what makes it happen. He's playing and singing with me and all the songs were vetted. All the songs that he played on I had them check out the words and make sure he was comfortable with everything and the concept.__EOS__ Hmm. Why was that important to you, Otis?__EOS__ Well, I didn't want him to say look what he did to me. You know what I mean?",2
52449," Yeah. A lot of people still called her Kitty. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. So what's the story behind this song? __EOS__ Well, this is written after she and Loudon split up for good, and she was kind of at loose ends. She was living in New York City on 115th Street with the two children and Loudon was living in the country house and he had a girlfriend at the time. And my mother and I went down, we rented the biggest car we could rent and we went down, and we scooped her up and with the kids and all her belongings and we moved back to Montreal temporarily because I don't think she really want to stay here forever. __EOS__ Angry at?

52451," It's pretty clear that, I think by their own admission, that one of the CIA officers misread an intelligence report which I think came from another detainee that had said - and this is in their words, not mine - but it was something like black American Muslims are training in the Al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan, and they want to find somebody to help them bomb gas stations in Montana. And he basically said get it out of KSM. Find out who that guy is who they recruited in the United States, and, you know, water board him until he gives us a name. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed basically says, over and over again, I don't what you're talking about. It's pretty clear they water board him so much he finally says, OK, I'll tell you everything. I want to talk. Please stop water boarding me. And then he makes up this story. It appears to be made up. There's no other evidence that it was real. I think the conclusion that the Senate investigators reached was that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, despite all the water boarding and all the torture, didn't provide any information that, say, helped the CIA stop an attack.__EOS__ Finally, the actual information that led to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's capture sounds like it almost got lost.__EOS__ It did almost get lost. They almost never got KSM. The CIA was in touch with - I guess you could call him an agent. They called - they referred to him as Asset X which is, you know, right out of a spy novel. He basically came to them and said, look, I can take you to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. And the CIA basically - I think the agent who was cultivating him made a recommendation back to headquarters saying let's put this guy in the payroll. He's great. The answer came back saying no, cut him loose. And they did. They cut him loose. And then I think nine months passed, and finally they found him again. And they almost cut him loose again. And then without any coordination or contact with the CIA, he just goes off and finds Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Pakistan, runs into him, slips off to a bathroom and sends his CIA handler a text message saying I am with KSM. And within hours, the CIA and Pakistani intelligence launched this military operation to grab Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, which they did. So yeah, it's an amazing story. Like, you couldn't make it up. But they almost missed him.__EOS__ Dexter Filkins wrote the story ""Khalid Sheikh Mohammed And The CIA"" for The New Yorker. He joined us from Brooklyn. Dexter Filkins, thanks very much.",3

And he was really not a      low-culture person, so this was all research; it wasn't his standard      range of reading.

52462," Colm Toibin grew up in Catholic Ireland at a time when devotion to the Virgin Mary was widespread. But he found the inspiration for his fictional account of Mary's life, not in Ireland but in Italy. While on a trip to Venice, Toibin happened upon two very different works of art  Titian's ""Assumption,"" depicting a red-robed Mary being taken up into heaven surrounded by angels, and a painting of the Crucifixion by Tintoretto.__EOS__ And I was absolutely struck by the difference between the two images. One, pure, the way they wanted her to be, arising, you know, into heaven; and the other impure, chaotic, cruel, strange, unforgettable.__EOS__ It is the space between these two images that Toibin explores in ""The Testament of Mary."" This brief novella takes place many years after the Crucifixion. Mary is being watched over by two of her son's followers. She has nothing but contempt for her son's disciples; always has, from the moment she saw Jesus preaching to them and heard a false note in his voice.__EOS__ She calls them misfits, only children, stammerers, men who could not look women in eye. And they sort of appalled her because the language that they were using did not seem to her to be right.",0
52463," The opposition leaders, whom you mentioned, Thomas, Mousavi and Karroubi, they've been put under house arrest. Is that correct? __EOS__ Yes, they've been under house arrest, and I think what we're seeing now here is a sort of watershed moment. They have been tolerated by Iran's leaders in the last year. There was a kind of unspoken  in which the opposition leaders will not call for protests and in which they would also not be arrested in return. __EOS__ Thomas, you saw these big demonstrations in Tehran yesterday. It sounds like a pretty quiet day there today. Is there a sense in Tehran that these protests will build, that you'll see waves of demonstrations, as you saw back in 2009? __EOS__ No. I actually don't expect to see a wave of protests. Now, we mustn't forget it could be - if, for instance, the opposition leaders are arrested in the coming week, that that will lead to new protests, but for now, no new dates have been planned. ",3
52464," If we look at a few years ago, it doesn't seem like it was all that hard for you to be an outlaw.__EOS__ Trouble seemed like it was always looking for me.__EOS__ We're talking about when you shot a man in a parking lot - shot him in the face in 2007.__EOS__ Yeah, well, that happened because he was such a bully.",2
52465," I think I felt a little bit of both. I mean, there were areas on the grass where some papers were scattered, and the next morning I remember kind of lifting up a couple of them, looking at them - someone's notes on a seminar it looked like they were giving, someone's Avis parking garage ticket, people's boarding passes. So yes, you felt a little bit like you perhaps shouldn't be looking but again - it was very strange because it was - you know, there was no one there. It was a - it was a crime scene but it wasn't.__EOS__ So how much contact did you have with the separatists at the crash site?__EOS__ So, I had a lot of contact with the separatists at the crash site. I mean, they were - they were there - a number of them were there sort of on the - in the early days and you know, it's - it's interesting because I think that the narrative that very quickly established itself out there was that you know, the separatists - and this is the villagers - all of the villagers were saying this to me - you know, the separatists are so - you know, they're so bumbling, and they're poor, and they don't - they have old guns, and they - you know, their pants are tied together with string, and they can barely kind of do anything for - I mean, how could you - how could these people shoot down an airplane? And so that kind of took hold, and the Russian television version sort of eventually hooked into that and then kind of ran with an entirely different narrative from our narrative, which was the rebels shot down the plane. And we don't think they did it on purpose, we think they did about mistake but still you know, they were the ones who did it. But our narrative was very different than the narrative on the ground.__EOS__ And our narrative is also that was probably Russian-supplied weapon.",3
52466," Teddy Barton, Nick Carraway.__EOS__ A German spy?__EOS__ No, no, no, no. He's a Kaiser .__EOS__ I heard he killed a man once.",1
52467,"  But you know, there's--a lot of guys are coming up to me that      are, like, 35, 36 years old and saying, `I haven't bought a record in      five years. I haven't been to a show in four years.  My wife and I, we      got a sitter for the kids tonight and we're not going to go into work      tomorrow.  We're going to have a good time.'  And what we're basically      doing is--Tad's 33? __EOS__  Yeah. __EOS__  I'm 33. __EOS__  No, 32. ",2
52468," He's here in the United States at that point?__EOS__ He's here in the United States at that point. And let me read a little bit of the letter.  Dear, dear boy, today I have to write to you again. It's so sad that by now our correspondence has come down to an exchange of letters only on certain occasions. But my darling, do not think that I am reproaching you. I know that three years is an awfully long time, so much can happen. A long, long time ago, you wrote to me from Vienna when I was supposed to go to Prague that one should not be so small-minded to sacrifice the present to the phantom of the future. You wrote those words in a completely different context at the time, but you were so right then. And maybe that's your thinking right now as well. And maybe you are right in not wanting to sacrifice your present, either, to the past or to the future. It is, however, so terribly sad for me because I live almost without a present, and I can live only for the past and for the future.__EOS__ Your quest to piece together Valy's story carries you to Germany, England, the Czech Republic, Austria, and it took you years. Why were you so committed to unearthing this one woman's story?__EOS__ Well, I think that what I realized at the very beginning of this project was that the Nazi experiment was not just to exterminate, but to erase - to render people literally unmemorable. And the idea that this woman, Valy, that I sort of fell in love with - her letters are gorgeous - could narrate for me her own life. And whether she had survived or not survived - at the beginning, I didn't know. But I could allow her to tell us her story herself and push back against what the Nazis had done. And I thought that this was an opportunity to tell one person's story - a regular person, someone who might have been someone you knew.",0
52469,"  Trust you? Mookie, the last time I trusted you, we ended up with a son.__EOS__ We are talking about none other than Rosie Perez. And you might already know that she was a breakout star on ""Soul Train,"" has been a choreographer for the artists I mentioned, and has been nominated for an Oscar and an Emmy. But what you might not know is what a hard climb it was to get there. She talks about all of this in a moving new memoir, called ""Handbook for an Unpredictable Life  How I Survived Sister Renata and My Crazy Mother, and Still Came Out Smiling ."" And Rosie Perez is with us now. Thank you so much for joining us.__EOS__ Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure. And I love your show.__EOS__ Oh, thank you so much.",0
52470," And the way the schedule was it was so tight that I had to get a driver in order to successfully make it from each gig to the next gig one time. It was everything from the large group ensemble that's featured on the record to playing like ""Real Lies"" and ""I Can't Help It"" that I had to go play a show with a salsa band and I had to play a show with a DJ. Then I...__EOS__ Wait. Did you say salsa?__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ I struggled in a salsa band for years to try to play those rhythms and it's very very difficult.",2
52471," I am. I didn't grow up with a very broad perspective of what my life could be and so I was very shy, and therefore a person who found my comfort and pleasure in eating, like some other people that we know who are very famous. It's very hard to move away from that. I don't care how successful you are in some other areas; it's hard to move away from a biscuit with gravy. Can you imagine a biscuit with gravy? What could be more unhealthy? You know what I'm saying? But delicious. Okay? What could be--what could taste better than some greasy French fries? You know what I'm saying? Really greasy, not just, you know, nicely sliced potatoes and, you know, lightly sautéed in olive oil, no, no, no, no, no. We want them dipped in some, you know--and you can hear them cracking and all that kind of stuff. I mean, that's how I grew up, you know? __EOS__00 in the morning. And so we changed our life and we're happy because we're healthy. __EOS__ And the music continues to make us happy, whether it's the great solo things or the wonderful duets you've done, not only with Donnie Hathaway, but our friend Peabo Bryson. __EOS__ Love Peabo Bryson. That's a singing child. ",2
52472," It sounds it's the same thing. Yeah. __EOS__ Yeah. But here, they have the heat is up under there, and then you put the meat, the goat, or whatever you're cooking and then you cover it up. And obviously, the fire goes up while the stone are still heated. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And a it's great barbecue, and a lot of people seemed to believe that that is the very first barbecue in North and South America  ",0
52473,"  It is a self-evident truth that things, which are equal to the same thing, are equal to each other.__EOS__ The film is already being praised for its attention to detail, including the detailed work of its sound designer Ben Burtt. Now, you may not know his name, but you definitely know his work.__EOS__ That's the sound of a light saber. Ben Burtt invented that sound for ""Star Wars,"" and he's something of a legend in the sound world. So when it came to the Lincoln film, Ben Burtt wasn't going to settle for just recreating old sounds. He actually wanted to record those real sounds - sounds Lincoln heard. So Burtt and his team set out - recording equipment in hand - to capture the sounds of Lincoln's life. And the first stop was in Kentucky to record an important Lincoln relic.__EOS__ The pocket watch at that time was a very intimate item, something carried in the pocket of, let's say, Lincoln's vest, his coat. It's kind of next to his heart. It's something that would have been with him at all times. And so I began to investigate the possibility would anybody actually wind up one of these watches and see if it still would tick. And nobody had ever done that, as far as I could tell, when I began talking to museum people across the country. Eventually, I discovered a watch which is in the possession of the Kentucky Historical Society. This was a watch passed down from Lincoln's son Robert Lincoln. And so they brought in a watch smith, and they wound it up. It takes a key to wind a watch from that era. And lo and behold, there was the ticking of the sound of Lincoln's actual watch.",1
52474,"  Well, you have food. You have clothing. You have shelter. __EOS__  Well, sort of. I have a den with no other bears. Is that shelter? __EOS__  You need some other bears? __EOS__  Uh-huh, yeah. I miss them. You know what I'm talking about. I know you do. ",1
52475,"  Yeah, nice try, Lee. __EOS__ Really, he is Stan Lee. Now, he's made a cameo appearance on TALK OF THE NATION. Stan Lee, thank you so much for your time today. __EOS__ Oh, it was great being here. I really enjoyed it. Thank you. __EOS__ Stan Lee, chairman emeritus of Marvel Enterprises and founder of PowEntertainment. The book, ""The Stan Lee Universe,"" comes out this December. And he joined us from a studio at the Paley Center in Beverly Hills.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0
52476," Yeah. __EOS__ There are so many movies of yours we could talk about. But I wanted to talk about ""The Cider House Rules,"" which you made in 2000, won you your second Oscar. It's a lovely film, really, based on the John Irving novel, and I thought we'd listen to a bit of this. You play a doctor at an orphanage for unwanted children in Maine who also performs abortions for young women who need them. There's a young man there played by Tobey Maguire named Homer who you've trained as a gynecologist and has learned to deliver babies, but he refuses to do abortions. It's against his principles. And in this particular scene we're going to hear, a young teenage girl has come in in distress because she has been to a back alley abortionist and you're treating her. You speak first to her and then to this young apprentice, Homer. __EOS__  Dear child, did you do something to yourself? __EOS__  It wasn't me. It wasn't me. ",1
52477," Well, I'll start out by telling you a story of Tyrone who was a young guy. He's actually now a student at Morehouse, which is a historically black college down in Atlanta. But Tyrone dropped out of high school. He went and got a job working on cars when he began to come into his own in his 20's, and he decided, I think I can go to college. And I love his story because he came to a college bookstore. He started looking through our books and decided, oh, yeah, I like math. There seems to be a lot of math in these accounting books. So he enrolled at LaGuardia in accounting, and after his first test in accounting, his professor was waiting for him outside the door.__EOS__ Well, let's talk a little bit about what happens before any of these young people do get to college. I mean, it indicates - this report suggests that college readiness also plays a role. It says that while 53 percent of white men met the ACT College Readiness standards in math, 30 percent of Latinos do and only 14 percent of black males do. So what does that mean for the students when they walk in the door?__EOS__ They walk in to a big gap. And if a college doesn't take seriously our responsibility to make sure those students feel engaged and connected and to have hope, they're not going to make it. Making a connection with peers who have the same issues, but also the same aspirations as you, can really make a difference in these young men's lives.__EOS__ But, you know what - one of the other things I wanted to ask you about is that we often talk about college completion and how that connects to family responsibilities, right. So - but often people think that that has to do with women. And I notice that when it comes to enrollment, LaGuardia is similar to other community colleges in that there are more women than men. Well, a lot of women attending community college do have family responsibilities - so why is it that their completion rate is still higher?",3
52478," Yeah. In any case, I also had the chance to meet your wonderful wife, and she will want me to remind you, you better finish the redesign of the bathroom first. __EOS__ That's correct. __EOS__ There are things you have priorities over. __EOS__ Mike Carriker, thank you very much for your time today. It was a pleasure to meet you this week. ",1
52479," Okay. So this is PJ Harvey in 1995, ""To Bring You My Love."" __EOS__  I was born in the desert. I been down for years. Jesus, come closer. I think my time is near. __EOS__ That's PJ Harvey, recorded in 1995. She has a new album called ""Let England Shake."" __EOS__ There wasn't really a point that I can recall. I was a visual artist primarily and a writer. Even from a very young age I wrote a lot of stories and poetry, and likewise I had a desire to create always with painting and drawing, and I still do that daily. ",2
52480," Now, that's fabulous. That's Marty Stuart, and his new album is called ""Saturday Night/Sunday Morning."" It's a double album. One album is Saturday night kind of songs and the other is Sunday morning kind of songs - more like gospel, spiritual kind of songs. So let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. And we'll hear more of Marty Stuart's music, including him performing in the studio 'cause he's brought his guitar. That's after a break. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ If you're just joining us my guest is Marty Stuart, and he has a new album called, ""Saturday Night/Sunday Morning."" Marty Stuart, you've brought your guitar. Can I ask you to play for us...__EOS__ Sure.__EOS__ ...One of the original songs that's on the ""Saturday Night"" album from your double album?",2
52481," Right. But when Charlie's in prison, and he's in the workshop in 1964, 1965, suddenly, every other song on the radio was by this band called the Beatles. What got Charlie was not just the music, but the effect The Beatles had on everybody. Suddenly, you know, everybody's talking about them. Everybody's looking up to them, and Charlie wanted some of that for himself. So he had a guitar, and for the first time, he started writing songs. And he was positive when he got out of jail, if he could just get somebody powerful in the record business to hear him play his songs, he would get a record deal right away, would sell millions of records and become more famous than the Beatles.__EOS__ Terry Melcher was producing The Byrds at the time.__EOS__ The Byrds. And he also - Melcher had this ability to sort of pick obscure performers and elevate them. Like, he found a garage band, dressed them up in Revolutionary War stuff, called them Paul Revere and the Raiders. And over the course, I guess, of three or four years at Columbia, Terry Melcher ends up producing about 80 hit singles.__EOS__ Jeff Guinn, speaking with Terry Gross in 2013. His book ""Manson  The Life And Times Of Charles Manson"" is now out in paperback. We'll continue their conversation in the second half of the show. I'm David Bianculli and this is FRESH AIR.",3
52482," So what does it mean to be a fox? I love the idea that these animals are - that this animal in particular is having an identity crisis about whether he should be overcoming his fox instincts or not. __EOS__ Yes, he's a bit obsessed with the idea of being a wild animal. __EOS__ And, you know, the creatures in the film, you know, like, they're all dressed as humans with, like, you know, suits and ties and dresses, but - and - you know, they have, like, kitchens and living rooms and furniture, but underneath it all, I mean, they're animals. __EOS__ ...like, you know, like animals, because that's what they are, and it's so funny. ",3
52483," That's Dave Grohl, who pulled into Sound City in 1991 in a rusted, white van with his bandmates in Nirvana. They were unknown when they got there, but the album that came out of that studio - ""Nevermind"" - turned rock music on its head.__EOS__ I remember those really simple moments of being in the studio. And those 15 days or 16 days - whatever it was - that board totally changed my life.__EOS__  Hello, hello...__EOS__ Dave Grohl, the Nirvana drummer and founder of Foo Fighters, from his new documentary film ""Sound City,"" which is really a love story about that studio and in particular, that board he just mentioned. Dave Grohl joins me from his own studio in Los Angeles. Dave, welcome to the program.",2
52484, Will I ever see you again. __EOS__  Will there be no one above me to pour my faith in? __EOS__ Case herself admits her voice is both her signature and one that she is still learning to use. __EOS__ I know that I can sing really loud. It's like having that really big Evinrude engine on the back of your fishing boat. But I've been trying to be more dynamic with my voice and not just singing on ten all of time out of terror. ,2
52485," You've got a new comedy special called...__EOS__ I do__EOS__ ...""D.L. Hughley  The Endangered List."" And tell us about the premise of it.__EOS__ If you take the requirements for a species to be declared endangered, a black man, first of all, he fits all of them. Predation, societal neglect, large percentage of males in captivity so there's no procreation, encroachment on the habitat, so virtually all of that kind of can fit into the idea. But I will say this, I think we have a lot more compassion for animals and things than we do people.",0
52486," Right. That's a good point. No, I think that the awareness and the pink-ribbon culture is very good compared to what there was before, which was such a stigmatization of the disease, going back to the 1970s, that you could barely mention it. You know, obituaries would just say, died of a long illness. They would not… __EOS__ Right. Listen, my mother passed away from cancer in the early '80s. So you can imagine. I mean, there is a huge difference, you know, from now and from then. But I think when you're saying this positiveness, it is really, it is a pressure that I think our friends and families don't realize that we get, that strain. __EOS__ Yeah. And here's something that really horrified me that I learned recently and put in the book, is that some breast cancer support groups expel people who go into metastasis and who are clearly going to die. You can't be in the group because just your presence might bring other people down. __EOS__ Right. ",0
52487," Boy.__EOS__ And I was just pacing the floor in my apartment, like, how am I going to write something that could even compare? And I just stopped thinking of it like that and was like, you know, just write from your heart but really good though.__EOS__ Well, that's how he began, right, writing from the heart. He just got really good at it.__EOS__ Yeah. And there was a point in the process where I had written these verses and I sent it back to him and he was like, you know, I like the verses. Here's the melody for the bridge because he didn't give it to me all at once, and I was stuck. And it took me four months. Ultimately he was like what is the holdup? And I said, you know, I just, I'm scared that it's not going to be good enough. And he's like I've got tons of songs like that. You just have to finish it. It's OK. And just having that kind of encouragement was a really big deal for me.",2
52488," You know, we hired real boxers. We wanted to duplicate the most exciting parts of the fights that we were going to use in the film. And, you know, we just went in there, and we really hit each other. __EOS__ See, I'd be really worried if I were in your position because you're an actor. You need your face. And, you know, boxers' faces, their noses sometimes get broken. You can knock out teeth. I mean, there's maybe not so much knocking out teeth because you're wearing that mouthpiece but, I mean... __EOS__ The mouthpiece. It builds character, you know. __EOS__ Tell that to the casting director. ",1
52489," Yeah. It is the idea that time is, you know - existentially in terms of a person - is relative to his own experience. You know, and there's the other story about this poor woman who's told by her doctor that she only has six months to live. And the doctor says, well, probably the best thing for you to do is to marry a tax attorney. And she says, is that can improve my health? And he - and the doctor says, no, but it will make six months seemed like an eternity. __EOS__ There's one in there, there's, it's just a line. It's a doctor's office, and the nurse comes in and she says, doctor, there's an invisible man here for an appointment. And the doctor says, tell him I can't see him. __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ That's right. ",0
52490," Sure. __EOS__  Oh little darling. __EOS__ Yeah. Right. __EOS__ Oh, you know, the people went wild and I went wild. And I just thought, boy, if you can turn people on like this, even for just a few minutes it would be the greatest thing in the world. ",2
52491," Betto, I'm hearing our last song. This is, unfortunately - sadly, we have time for just one more. What I'm hearing now sounds a lot more traditional than the last couple of tracks.__EOS__ Yeah. We're going to go back to Colombia on this track and back to Quantic, the first artist we've heard from. This is a band called Ondatropica. It's an all-star collective of Colombian musicians that Mario Galeano of the band Frente Cumbiero - I don't know if you remember. We talked about him before.__EOS__ Oh yeah, I remember.__EOS__ And Quantic have brought together these old cats to record with younger musicians. And the result is absolutely fantastic. Listen to this big band cumbia.",2
52492," Yeah, or just keep the mistake. And I think that also you can hear the difference in when you're playing live with a band, than the difference in when you are recording in studio very separately. It's like the soul goes onto the tape with the music. __EOS__ Well, let's listen to another cut, if we could - ""On My Own."" __EOS__  The sun comes up and drives away this dark and lonesome night. I'm , come with me. I'll still be on my own... __EOS__ So I was doing a little reading on Patsy Cline just to try and determine if in fact she'd ever been to Iceland before I asserted so confidently that she hadn't. I could find no record on that, but I found a wonderful quote from her about her singing, and I wonder if I could run that by you and get you to reflect on your own singing. ",2
52493," There's one other question about this notion of originalism. What - we talked about how the notion that you can go back to the original intent of the founders of the Constitution may not be a useful way to look at law because it has to be flexible, and all of the situations and challenges that the Republic would confront could not have been anticipated by the framers. __EOS__ I agree completely. This is a continuum. This isn't a question of two absolutes. This isn't a question of you either follow the Constitution absolutely, positively, immutably, or you throw the Constitution away and just decide what you think. There are cases - most cases, of course - where a justice will go to the Constitution or another statute and say this is what the statute means. __EOS__ Well, Lawrence Goldstone, it's been interesting. Thanks so much. __EOS__ Thank you. ",0
52494," Wait. This is like, inside their mouth? __EOS__ This is just above the mouth. __EOS__ They have a nose inside their mouth? __EOS__ Just above the mouth. Between the palates - between the hard palate and the nose, there is a space. We have - we used to have that organ, but it got lost somewhere in primate evolution. Most mammals do have it - cats have it, horses have it, cows have it. But humans and monkeys don't. And dogs and many other animals will lick something, and then theyll flick the saliva, which has got some odor in it, up into this little pouch above the roof of their mouths. And that seems to store information about - or analyze information about what that person smells like in a way that complements what's coming in through the conventional route, the nose - the one we understand. ",0
52495," But, Pyle says, she enjoyed playing up the atmospherics, too.__EOS__ Trish, the costume designer - she was so excited because Nancy - Nancy wears a lot of leather and she wears a lot of loud clothing. So I got to wear all of those, like, leather jackets and, you know, really bold print pants and get the hair really big and a lot of makeup. So it was really fun to do that. And that kind of put me, also, into the character.__EOS__ The one person most likely to take issue with that presentation doesn't.__EOS__ I was very flattered most lately that Ben Affleck included me in ""Gone Girl."" I think my husband and I were the only people laughing at certain junctures of the movie.",1
52496,"  Why can't you just be normal?__EOS__ .__EOS__ Horror movie scholar Caetlin Benson-Allott finds this scene scary, emotionally and sonically.__EOS__ What's so grating, like, when he's having his temper tantrum in the backseat, is not actually him kicking the front seat or screaming, mommy, but this sort of shrieking, electrical noise that isn't actually coming from the child.",1
52497," The music that got The Black Keys out of the lawn mowing business is deliberately primitive. There's no horn section, no backup vocals, no dancing girls. __EOS__ They say their music is sloppy, partly because of their influences. Pat Carney listened to modern garage rock bands while Dan Auerbach listened to old Mississippi blues. __EOS__ It was the same aesthetic and I think that's what Pat and I kind of - we had this understanding. We both liked that kind of spur-of-the-moment improvisation in the recording process, you know. There's just - there's something about that where there's some life there. __EOS__ You said you liked sloppy... ",2
52498," We were talking about your nervousness before going on stage. What's the worst thing that's ever happened to you on stage? __EOS__ The worst thing that's ever happened to me, once somebody died in Las Vegas, but that wasn't the worst thing. __EOS__ In the audience? __EOS__ In the audience. Oh, yeah, I've died several times on stage. ",1
52499," Well, that was my first feature length film, and honestly, I, you know, I shot it. I edited it. I drove the car. I got the releases. I did the sound. It was really kind of a classic, you know, run and gun situation. So I had no expectations for that film. It was just a project that, you know, I had passion up for, but my wife and I used to joke it that we were planning on, you know, renting out a room and getting a projector and some pizzas and showing it to our friends, so they could see what I'd been doing the last couple of years.__EOS__ ...but it doesn't necessarily get you the money. So I'm still, you know, been rejected from a number of grants and festivals, things like that since then.__EOS__ Interesting, also you mentioned that. This is the last year that the current rules for documentaries are in effect. Next year, a new set of rules are in effect. And as I understand, this film, ""If A Tree Falls,"" was made in cooperation with POV and PBS, and under the new rules, it wouldn't qualify.__EOS__ Well, no, I think, it would qualify. It had a theatrical release put out by a company called Oscilloscope that, you know, real theatrical distributor. So it played in many cities, and so it would have qualified, even though it was funded in part by television.",1
52500," In a totally different direction, do you see the Lakers repeating? __EOS__ I think the Lakers have a good chance to repeat. Theyve improved the team. I think the addition of Ron Artest is going to make a difference down the road. They certainly wont be seen as being a soft team anymore. __EOS__ Yeah. That was Ron Artest. __EOS__ The word soft has not been associated with him in his career. Well, Mr. Jabbar we know youre involved in a lot of projects, so youre welcome back anytime to talk about them. Whats the documentary youre working on? ",3
52501," Mm-hmm. __EOS__  I could have been an architect. I could have been a doctor. Been a good police, yeah, yeah, yeah, looking for a robber. Flew solo at Shanghai . We're meant to be a loner. Could've put up a real good fight. I got a good chance, but I'm giving it up for love. __EOS__  I could have been an architect. I could have been a doctor. Been a good police, yeah, yeah, yeah, looking for a robber. Flew solo at Shanghai . We're meant to be a loner. Could've put up a real good fight. I got a good chance, but I'm giving it up for love. __EOS__ You mentioned Jill Scott, who you brought in on God Bless the Child. And you also got Paul McCartney involved. ",2

52504," No, the interesting thing about that is it started more when I first got drafted. I think it converged to much more of a common space of if you look from the minor league experience versus the major league experience. __EOS__ Your degree was in engineering. Did those skills translate at all, give you an edge in the game, you know, which obviously involves angles and dimensions and fast calculations? __EOS__ Well, I thought it would be more of an advantage than it ended up, actually. You know, I used to get teased as being called the rocket scientist when I was with the Cubs. And you realize fairly quickly, at the professional level, you have to have moments where you're sort of blank. You're not thinking. You're not calculating. You're just in a space to perform and react and trust your instincts. Yes, you can use the engineering to prepare. That was very important. I had a system. I had to figure out why does this guy throw pitches in a pattern, so I can be prepared. __EOS__ Now, baseball's different from other sports in that there's typically this long apprenticeship in the minor leagues. I mean, in a lot of sports, you'll see a player drafted and will become a pro that year or the next year and have a big impact. In baseball, folks spend years in the minors. You were a first-round pick in 1991, and I guess your first big league year was what, '96? ",0
52505," Why did you want to shoot on location in New York? __EOS__ Well, once you were shooting in New York, it was almost no choice. We had very limited studio space in that - in those days, so that you had no choice. But also, it coincided clearly with the kind of picture we were doing, which were usually very realistic pictures, pictures that benefited visually from being done on location. __EOS__ Were there problems when you were one of the pioneers doing that, since crews weren't used to it? The people on the streets weren't used to having movies shot outside their homes or their offices. __EOS__ Yeah. But they were all good problems. The problems are much more severe now, because everybody's so sophisticated. So they not only charge you a hell of a lot more to use their facility... ",1
52506," You have almost double the number of African-Americans who don't have health insurance as opposed to white Americans. And, of course, this goes along with all the, you know, I mean, the latest statistics with median household income nearly 50,000 for white families, around 30,000 for African-American families. I mean, it's - health care is just one more example of our unique American ability to punish people simply because they are of a particular class or race. __EOS__ If you had a magic wand and you could wave it over the United States' health care system, would you try to structure it like, say France or Cuba, or would you create something different and what would that be? __EOS__ Well, first of all, health care would be free. You would never have to worry about paying for anything because it would be completely funded by the government. Number two  We would shift our whole emphasis with medicine toward prevention. This is what the Cubans do actually very well because they don't have any money. They only spend $251 a person each year on health care; we spend around 7,000. __EOS__ Let's turn to your filmmaking, where do you get your ideas, your financing? How long does it take for you to make a doc? And where did the idea for this come from? ",3

52508," Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.__EOS__ ...a well-known producer.__EOS__ And you say you hear the music in your head. Is it your own voice? Is it - like how does it work?__EOS__ Usually, it's not my own voice. It's usually many different voices, and that's always a hard subject to talk about because it kind of sounds crazy, you know, to say, hey, I hear an older black male voice. Sometimes, I hear a younger woman's voice. Sometimes, I hear a child's voice or, you know, there's many, many different voices, either you feel connected to them and you write them down. I try to write down every song that comes to me, and if you just write every song, then you get to the good ones.",2
52509," My Autobiography"" by Janis Ian. __EOS__  Come to my door, baby. Face is clean and shining black as night. My mother went to answer you know that you looked so fine. __EOS__ Actually, I figured wrong. Janis Ian's revolutionary hit record ""Society's Child"" is actually an echo of 1966. She was all of 15 when she wrote it, a rock song in the voice of a white teenage girl addressing her black teenage boyfriend. I think of it as revolutionary because it was a pop music hit, electric instruments and all, taking on a serious social theme. That didn't happen much in 1966. Well, several years later in the 1970s, Janis Ian wrote and recorded another very memorable song, an anthem of the adolescent outsider. __EOS__  I learned the truth at 17 that love was meant for beauty queens, and high school girls with clear-skinned smiles who married...

52510," But the night at the Roxy that we talked about, there were death threats by them. The FBI was everywhere around the place. It was the first time we played a white hall and the first time we said we were going to break this chitlin' circuit. And it was scary, but we got through. And we got picketed...__EOS__ Why were there death threats? Where were they coming from?__EOS__ A lot of people made a lot of money off the chitlin' circuit. It was a very big business, and it was not - you know, it was a time of gangsterism in the music business - a lot of Italian mob, a lot of Afro-American mob. You know, a lot of people went to jail during that era for a lot of stuff that wasn't friendly.__EOS__ And this was big business. I mean, you know, we played - we sold out Radio City Music Hall. We had probably a thousand pickets outside. There were organized pickets against - there was no legitimate reason for a black man not to play Radio City Music Hall, except that he was getting paid.",1
52511," Well, I wanted to dress Colin Firth's character in a way that would be appropriate to who he was as a personality. So I thought, okay, this is a guy who is not dependent on his salary as a teacher. This is a guy who comes from a fairly wealthy background. __EOS__ Because you're older. __EOS__ Well, yes, and it's terrible. And you know, a woman who has lived her life that way can often find herself in a moment where she cannot see her future. Now, she will have a future, but she's got to alter the way she moves through the world. __EOS__ Tom Ford, speaking to Terry Gross last December. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR. ",1
52512," Youre absolutely right on that Terry, it does keep changing. And this, once again, was people were saying well, wait a minute, we built on a scale of 18 inches to a foot, meaning that he would be 18 feet high and yet you want to make him - he said I want to make him - for this scene I want to make him bigger. __EOS__ I want to make him 24 - and they all kind of looked at him like -I want to make him 24 feet. And then on occasion he said forget the 18 to 24, I want to make him 45, you know. __EOS__ So it does keep changing. But he felt that the concept - when he got to New York he definitely had to be bigger because of the environment. And, of course, Cooper was right. Cooper had to, you know, do a lot of fighting for things that he believed in. But inevitably I found through the years he was right. __EOS__ Now ""King Kong"" is really filled with a lot of bondage imagery. You know, Fay Wray in flimsy chiffony dresses and lingerie... ",1

I'm certainly following, you know, advice about screen time and just trying to limit that in general. But, you know, I saw ""Bonnie and Clyde"" when I was eight years old, and I mean, I guess we can argue about how I turned out...__EOS__ I've been meaning to ask you about those banks you knocked over back in Kansas.__EOS__ This conversation has been with us for a very long time, and I think as a parent, the larger mission is to talk to your kids and to provide them the context for understanding something. I have a terrible memory, so I'm going to screw up the title of a very wonderful film. It's the World War II film about the guys who go after the gold. It's someone's gold. This is awful that I can't remember it. But it was the first film that my stepson - who's now 18 - ever saw in which the main characters are not behaving heroically.

Now, we know that people didn't intend to dishonor, but we nevertheless do something about it. If we bump into someone or something, we say, excuse me, even though it was unintended, and that's what was remarkable about - to me - what these kids did. They did it on their own and they're kids. It's wonderful. We can be so proud of what they did.__EOS__ If you're just joining us, I'm speaking with Ray Halbritter. He is the representative of the Oneida Indian Nation. You know, this comes at an interesting time because this whole debate over the professional sports team also named that name - we don't have to keep saying it - there's renewed attention to that name, and the owner of the team has been adamant and all of the leadership of that team has been adamant that they are not interested in changing the name, and yet there's been an increasing intensity around this locally.

52519," Yes, I'm one of the many Americans who have changed my views on the war over the years. I'm now opposed to our involvement there. But one of the problems I have with a lot anti-war movements is that they are not really clearly articulating a vision as to what they would do on the ground in Iraq. To bring a conclusion to this, all they talk about is leaving, and I don't think that's a solution. And I'll take my answer off the air. __EOS__ Thanks, Keith. Go ahead, Medea Benjamin. __EOS__ Well, that's not true at all. I mean, we have people like George McGovern who wrote a whole book about an exit strategy. We have people like Dennis Kucinich. You look on his Web site, you'll see a whole plan. Many of the people in the progressive caucus in Congress have their own plans. And now we have people like Barack Obama coming up with their plans.

Her book, ""Red River,"" focuses on the patriarchs of her family tree, the men who gathered at the courthouse that day. She talked about it with NPR's Farai Chideya. __EOS__ Coming to the courthouse to try to protect the new office holders was an incredibly dangerous thing to do. It meant that you were not only putting yourself in physical danger but you were at risk of losing everything that you had worked so hard to build up. __EOS__ Why was this history lost, do you think?

When leaving your house, don't carry anything you don't need, such as membership cards or licenses or credit cards. Please carry the Egyptian flag and refrain from carrying any signs of a political party, movement, group, organization or religious sect. The chants are unified and agreed-upon. Please refrain from profanity. Try as much as possible not to disturb traffic.__EOS__ Very effective. Those instructions were also the work of not just me, many people who were - you know, I've seen a lot of people coming up with suggestions, and also I learned a lot from the Tunisian revolution. One great thing about the Tunisian revolution is that all what you see is the Tunisian flag. That just sends the right message to those who are not in the square, those who are not in action.__EOS__ that this regime has to go.__EOS__ So in those early days, before you were imprisoned, and there were a couple of days of protest before you were kidnapped and arrested, did you think at some point is this going to turn into Tiananmen Square, where, like, the Chinese authorities brought in the tanks, and, you know, it was a catastrophe for the protestors.

They used to proclaim very loudly, we're long-term greedy. We don't deal in short term. We're better than the rest of the crowd.

52536," You know, I guess one of the things underlying my question is, how much do I think of the dog, and how much do I think of the family? I mean, he's not the same animal that we loved. On the other hand, does he deserve another day? Does he deserve another week? And yeah, it's a pain to clean up when he messes in the house but, you know, it can be done. To what extent should people think of themselves in this decision? __EOS__ I don't think they really should be part of the decision. I mean, they are because they own the dog. And they are his, you know, caregivers, his guardians and whatever, and they must get involved in the decision. But you know, as a veterinarian, I always think of the dog, and advise the people accordingly. __EOS__ I think this dog is actually doing pretty well, and he seems to enjoy being petted, and he has a lot of fun when you do this and that, and he's enjoying a good meal, you know; I think he's in good shape, relatively speaking, although he is on a slippery slope. And they often listen. __EOS__ That's it; he's old; he's gone. And that was that shelter statistic I mentioned earlier. He's too old; take him down to the shelter - which I really can't understand. And other people go the exact opposite extreme. They keep their dog alive despite the fact he can't walk; he's lost the place; he's sitting in a pool of urine and feces, and there's really nothing left. And they'll just keep going because they can't make that final decision. And I don't think that's kind to the dog. ",0
52537," But that was very fashionable. __EOS__ What, the lip-synching thing or the frugging thing? __EOS__ No, no, no. No, the dancing and the - they're still doing lip-synch today. __EOS__ Right. ",2
52538," Well I was about- I should have been about in the 9th grade, I guess ninth or 10th grade. __EOS__ So, so... __EOS__ But I wasn't, I was recording. __EOS__ What changed in your life immediately after the record started getting airplay? ",2
52539," Your first big artist that you signed to Arista was an unknown entertainer, Barry Manilow.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ How did you approach him?__EOS__ With Barry, I went over the material. He had one album out before that. It had sold about 10,000 copies. He was still pretty unknown, except for his new work that he was doing at the arranger for Bette Midler in her emerging career. I saw him as really a terrific, ingratiating entertainer with a strong voice. And I went and listened to the material he had been doing for the second album, and I didn't feel there was a single there. And that's when I brought him ""Mandy."" Changed the name. It was originally called ""Brandy.""",2

Name a couple. __EOS__ Well, of course, Lockerbie, first of all. The La Belle discotheque. Before that... __EOS__ In Germany. __EOS__ In Germany. The fact that the regime was channeling weapons to the IRA.

52543," Hi, Liane. It's so nice to be here. Thank you. __EOS__ Well, we have to get rid of the elephant in the room. Did you use much Auto-Tune on this? __EOS__ Well, no. The truth is when you're making an album like this one or an EP, you want to find a marriage between the aesthetic quality of the songs and the authenticity of the artist's voice, and in my case, this voice. So, yes, if we had a take where we captured the emotion of the song and we expressed what we were hoping to express, but there were one or two notes out of key that needed fixing, you know, because the software is there, we used it. But other than that we stayed really true to who I was as an artist and the voice that I wanted to present. __EOS__ Now, it must've been very expensive to spend a day recording at Avatar. And you're still unsigned. I mean, you've released the recording independently. ",2
52544," Right. __EOS__ Now, if you - very carefully, you look at those boxes which are holding the apples and the bananas. And yes, they're coming from something called Patty's Farm, making us believe that Patty was just backing up her truck this morning and offloading all her bananas from the farm. Well, the story is probably very different. Those individual cardboard boxes is actually one big, gigantic dummy with plastic inside, which are holding the bananas. And yes, in the backside of the store, they're offloading all those bananas from huge plastic containers, most likely flown in the day before, into those individual-looking cardboard boxes - which by the way, is not Patty's Farm. It's actually been designed by a graphic design company in New York City to make us feel this is nostalgia at its peak. __EOS__ I'm speaking with Martin Lindstrom. He is the author of a new book, called ""Brandwashed."" Martin, you actually carried out your own experiment. You hired a family to live in Laguna Beach, in Southern California. You filmed them secretly, and you have them basically invite friends over from the neighborhood. And they would just casually talk about things, brands of things that they're using - like a blender or a type of car. Tell me about this experiment. __EOS__ So what we did then was, non-scripted, basically to ask this family to have one mission  to tell the world about 10 different brands we carefully had selected, but to make sure no one would discover why they were talking about those brands - so the hidden intent. I have to admit, I was fairly skeptical in the beginning - I thought, mm, I wonder what we'll get out of this - but was blown away already the first week when I realized that the word of mouth is so much more powerful. And the reason why I had that sense was because I had actually tried, almost a year before, exactly that phenomenon on my own body. ",0
52545," So, how did you do it? Because his words are so well known.__EOS__ Well, it wasn't easy. But when - remember, he had such a poor education, I felt that our backgrounds weren't that different. And therefore I could enter into his psyche in a way, and also his great sadness. And also I suffer from depression, so I felt an immediate intimacy with that. And once I could enter into that world, the music began to flow.__EOS__ How important was getting the history right to you?__EOS__ Well, the history's a kind of frame and a straightjacket at the same time. You know, you have to deal with the Civil War, you have to deal with all the instance with the love for Mary, and the Emancipation Proclamation, which for me was the most important American document ever written. So, you have to stretch that straightjacket and push the fiction inside it. And then you have a kind of explosion, and that's what I wanted to do.",0
52546," The Venezuelan president has become more dangerous to the U.S. than Fidel Castro ever was. Hes more dangerous than bin Laden and the effects of Chavezs war against America could eclipse those of 9/11. __EOS__ Oliver Stone takes the film to the opposite extreme. If the U.S. media paints Chavez as Satan, then Stone is going to show an angel sent to save South America. __EOS__ Who is Hugo Chavez? Where did he come from? He was literally born in a mud hut and grew up in poverty __EOS__ The film is at its best when its tracking Chavezs dramatic rise to power. But most of the film plays as the strange buddy picture. Oliver Stone hangs out in the presidential palace. Oliver Stone flies on Chavezs private jet, Oliver Stone and Chavez tour factories. Throughout this whole thing, Stone the man famous for his conspiracy theories and questioning of the official story, never asks a single challenging question. Instead, he asked do you have any fun? Do you ever read for pleasure? ",1
52547,"   All you bullies get out of my way because I am really ticked off.__EOS__  I don't know.__EOS__  No, come on. If someone was right up in your grill, what would you say?__EOS__  I don't know.",1
52548," Well, you know, I consider the magical moments to be everything that came up to the recording and past it. You know, the soloists that appear on this record were really people that I've met over the course of my career and have inspired me to write the way that I do. So I had to have them part of this party and so a lot of the magic really came from what they had to offer me as a composer.__EOS__ And that's John Scofield.__EOS__ Yeah. Or, I know what Joe Lovano will sound like or I know what Luciana Souza's voice is going to be on this melody and I think, you know, it should go in this direction. And by then there are those moments where things happen that you'd never expect. They'll play a solo and something magical always happens.__EOS__ Before I let you go, any way you can give us a sneak peek on your latest projects or what's next on the horizon?",2
52549," To this day, though, decides he would rather not deal with controversy. For example, that great charge of the New York Giants who finally tied the Brooklyn Dodgers in the last day of the season, or second to the last day of the season, and went on to win in a three-game playoff, the shot heard around the world and all of that sort of stuff well, somewhat tarnished, as you point out, by the revelation that the manager of the Giants had set up a telescope out in the centerfield stands and in the Polo Grounds to intercept the other team's signals. __EOS__ Yes. And that has put of a tarnish on Bobby Thompson's homerun. And we asked Willie about that, you know, were you getting signals? Willie will quickly point out that he was actually in a terrible slump the last month of the season and that lasted throughout the playoffs. So he said, if it was out there, it sure didn't help me. __EOS__ But, in other words, he doesn't answer the question. He didn't say whether he was getting signals or not. He's saying, if I did... __EOS__ No. ",0
52550," I mean I... __EOS__ How old was she when she died? __EOS__ Eighty-four, I think. __EOS__ So did she live out that promise to herself? ",0
52551," Is it a little intimidating in a way? __EOS__ No. No. Not at all. I don't think life should be intimidating in any way. You know, I think you, especially with us, you know, when we were kids, you know, you had this indestructible feeling, you know, or immortality. And I want to live forever. So you guys better find a way, a genetical thing. You know, I don't want have my head chopped off and put in the freezer. __EOS__ I want to live it all. But anyway, no intimidation because, first of all, we had no idea. You know, we just heard about oh, this guy Beck liked you and said oh, amazing. Nice. __EOS__ But I really do want to ask, though. Do you feel that you have a gift, and what is your gift? What do you feel is the source of - what is this thing that… ",2
52552," And that's over a period of a month or so.__EOS__ Homicide-wise, Ann Arbor has maybe one or two a year.__EOS__ Rich Kinsey is a real retired Ann Arbor detective. He spent 13 years on the homicide squad.__EOS__ The last three years after I retired there, there wasn't one up until a few months ago.",0
52553," I can tell you exactly what was on my mind, just the line, the melodic line. And I was playing it. I used to joke about this one because it sounded like , and it sounded like one of the Caucasian melodies. __EOS__ I don't know if you get the pun, but he's been saying this for many years, and I always thought it was funny, the fact that he would use a Caucasian melody on this... __EOS__ But it was - Jerry heard it, and he said that sounds like strings. And I said why not? And so, why not? We had five violins and one cello, and they were all basically playing in unison. __EOS__ Because Jerry Wexler wouldn't spring for six violins and two celli. ",2
52554," Absolutely. It's an extraordinary contrast with what happens today. You're absolutely right to bring it up, because these eight Nazi saboteurs, all of whom who'd lived in the United States in the 1930s and then gone back to Germany. And two of them were American citizens. They were landed by submarine on the coast of Long Island and Florida in 1942, and they were rounded up pretty quickly. Two of them actually surrendered and gave information on the others. But Roosevelt was absolutely furious and demanded a military commission and basically demanded execution.__EOS__ And Biddle understood. And they - there was appeal made on their behalf to the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court judge, the special military commission set up to try them to be legal, and they were tried and found guilty very, very quickly. And of eight, six were executed, and the two who had surrendered and turned in the others were given long sentences.__EOS__ Let's go next to Rob. Rob with us from Menlo Park in California.__EOS__ Hi. How are you doing?",0
52555," Well, Arthur Ashe called me out of the blue - I'd met him once before - and asked me if I would write a book with him. I mean, we both sensed or knew that it would be his last book because he was already in the middle of full blown AIDS by that time and the world knew about it. And it was a humbling experience working with him. He was the embodiment of heroism, really. He never complained. He was always optimistic. It was heartbreaking and he died just toward the very, very end of the process of writing the book and, of course, that was a sad moment for all of us who admired him.__EOS__ You know, you mentioned several times the desire, the importance of telling the whole story. I don't know if you share this view. I'd like to advance the idea that there is still tension in your audience, but I would say particularly on African-Americans about how best to tell the whole story. Does that ever enter into your mind about what people want to think of their leaders and these important figures as opposed to what your research suggests is true? And how do you - what do you say to people who say, I don't think we should be putting that out there. We - you know, people should have this image intact.__EOS__ Well, I certainly have encountered that problem throughout my entire career. People are always saying - certain people and, really, in quite considerable number, really, that certain things should not be exposed to the world, that the emphasis should be put on the positive, especially when there is a minority person involved in the center of the portrait being painted.__EOS__ Do you - we have to talk about you for a minute. You're the author or editor of more than a dozen books. What got you started on this path? What made you choose this as your life's work?",0
52556," Yes.__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ But now you're a freelancer. Does that mean you have to get insurance on your own? Because this would certainly qualify as a pre-existing condition, I assume.",0
52557," This is NBC Nightly News, Friday, September 1st. __EOS__ Good evening. We'll have more on the developments in the Watergate bugging case. We'll hear George McGovern talking about tightening up his campaign organization and we'll have a look at the new unemployment figures. And first, Bobby Fischer. Today... __EOS__ In 1972, nobody was bigger news than chess master Bobby Fischer. He squared off against Russian Boris Spassky in a historic match seen as a showdown of the Cold War. __EOS__ Angola, USA."" ""Bobby Fischer Against the World"" features a lot of archival footage of Fischer. You can hear his awkwardness in this interview, conducted in his late 20s when he was in his chess-playing prime. ",1
52558," Where did the expelled Germans go?__EOS__ Well, this is it. They're expelled into a country which has been devastated. I mean, there's - there really is nowhere for a lot of them to go. They're shoved into a Germany where there's not enough food to go around for the people who are already there. There's no shelter. And suddenly, you have another 12 or 16 million people arriving.__EOS__ You know, you were talking about how whole groups of people were deported from, you know, from several countries after the war because they wanted to get the Germans out. They wanted to get collaborators and traitors out of their countries. And it's odd, in a sense, because what they're doing in part is trying to create more ethnic purity, which is what the Germans were guilty of.__EOS__ Well, exactly. It's kind of ironic, isn't it, that actually, the people after the war kind of finished off what the Germans had started, in some ways. And it was - this was a perennial problem. This wasn't something that was new to the Second World War. You know, during the aftermath of the First World War, they had had a - they tried to sort of purge Europe of these sort of minority communities in various different countries by changing the borders of the countries to suit the populations.",0
52559," What did rock music mean to you growing up?__EOS__ When I think, we had been so nervous about music because of the past in Germany. Singing German was very, very, a place not to go because the Nazis used the language for their propaganda songs. And, anyway, we just escaped into English and American rock and pop music. So, the Beatles, the Doors, the old blues, the Stones, then started a little bit the croc rock in the '70s. But the '60s being completely influential to us in Germany there.__EOS__ How do you take a German hit and turn it into a English-lyricked song?__EOS__ Oh, that's a tricky question.",2
52560," Oh, wow. __EOS__ And it was not... __EOS__ Which assassin were you? __EOS__ I played Leon Czolgosz, who assassinated President McKinley. And I recently saw the Broadway revival that they did and I was kind of like yeah, ours was as good as that, at least. I remember it very vividly, and we had an incredibly talented group of people and we really, really loved it. And that was an incredibly fulfilling time I had on stage. ",1
52561," OK.__EOS__  On the hottest day of July, trolling in dead calm waters near Key West, a tourist named James Mayberry reeled up a human arm. His wife flew to the bow of the boat and tossed her breakfast burritos.__EOS__ Well, there's even a line in the novel that refers to - for years South Florida was sort of the severed body parts capital of North America. I mean, this was back, you know, in the drug wars and in the days before that, the mob wars. I mean, we were one of the early vacation spots for the - all of the five crime families from New York. So we have plenty of experience with severed body parts, and they turn up all the time.__EOS__ Right, and one of the things that you describe is that there's a lot of, you know, charter fishing out there, and this happens on a charter fishing boat. And I wonder if this is true, that some of these companies have a way of scamming some gullible sports fisherman into thinking he's caught a sailfish. Does this really happen?",0
52562," This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with George Takei, who became famous for his role on ""Star Trek"" as Sulu, the helmsman of the starship Enterprise. A new documentary about him called ""To Be Takei"" opens August 22nd. The movie isn't just about his career. It's also about being closeted in Hollywood and how it changed his life when he came out at the age of 68 and became a gay rights activist. And it describes the years of his childhood during World War II, when he and his family were forced to live in an internment camp for Americans of Japanese descent.__EOS__ Well, you know, that was a time when most roles for Asians or Asian-Americans were very stereotyped, very shallow, cardboard figures - and not very attractive stereotypes at that. The buffoon or the client, silent servant or the evil villain. And when I decided to become an actor and I had those discussions with my father, I promised him that I would not do anything that would make him ashamed. And so I'd been avoiding stereotype roles, until one day my agent came up with me for this - as he called it - opportunity in a Jerry Lewis movie. He said Jerry Lewis movies make tremendous money at the box office. They're very successful and it's very important for a young actor to be associated with a money making project. And I said Fred, I mean, this is a very, I mean, this is the very kind of roles that we don't want to get and I really don't feel up to playing that. But he said...__EOS__ What was the role?__EOS__ Some kind of - it was called the loud mouth. And Jerry Lewis was the loudmouth, but I had something to do with something chemical and I was punished for it by being boiled in a cauldron. And I was, you know, I spoke with a heavy accent, I was easily excitable - it was a very stereotyped role. And there was another Jerry Lewis film called ""Which Way To The Front,"" in which I played a comic Japanese soldier. So - and my agent at that time, Freddie Shimota  - was a Japanese-American, urging me to take on the role. And I did want to be successful as an actor and he said being associated with a big box office movie will get you many, many other roles that would be satisfying and fulfilling. And so...",1
52563," Right. Right. __EOS__ Yeah. That's what people come up to me  American men come up to me in the street and they say to me, you know what I say to my boys before they go to bed? I say it's not goodnight you princes of Maine, you kings of New England, is it? And then they say, oh yeah, you guessed. __EOS__ Our guest is Michael Caine. His new memoir is called ""The Elephant to Hollywood."" __EOS__ If you're just joining us, our guest is actor Michael Caine. He's written a new memoir called ""The Elephant to Hollywood."" ",1

52565,"  Because the keys to the kingdom got locked inside the kingdom. And the angels fly around in there, but we can't see them. __EOS__ These days, you might just as easily find him at a book reading as on a concert stage. Ritter's debut novel titled ""Bright's Passage"" comes out this week. He told me the soundtrack for his writing was Radiohead. He'd put on his headphones, crank up ""Kid A"" and write every day wherever he could. __EOS__ I made a real decision to not be precious with where I wrote, you know. Most days, I'm traveling, and if you're in an airport lounge or a hotel room or a tour bus or backstage before a show, they're all places that you can write if you set your mind to it. __EOS__ So no cabin in the woods required. ",0
52566," It's this dark film that really has this very strong cult following. When you watched it, what did you take away? What did that film trigger for each of you?__EOS__ There's a wonderful sequence in that film that - I think it's a panning shot. You see some high school lockers, ordinary life on an everyday, you know, afternoon in an American high school. And you have Tears for Fears' ""Head Over Heels"" playing over it. And it's just raises the hair on the back of your neck. And to me, that's the '80s.__EOS__  I wanted to be here with you alone.__EOS__ The thing I loved about ""Donnie Darko"" was this idea that there are parallel lives, parallel universes, going on all around us that have equal impact as the world we can see, know, and feel. And as I was writing, I was thinking what might that be for me.",1
52567," Well, I was just not - I guess - at home with myself at the time. And maybe I was thinking about what had happened and why did people make so much fuss and noise about certain words and phrases that I was going to use or planned to use in this speech. But near the end of the speech, I said something like, if we do not see meaningful progress here today, the day may come where we're not confined on marching on Washington, but we may be forced to march through the South the way Sherman did, nonviolently.__EOS__ Speaking of that, you know, you returned to the same steps on Saturday. You talked about how back in 1963, we hadn't heard of the Internet, we didn't have a cellular telephone - iPad, but we used what we had to bring about a nonviolent revolution.__EOS__ I just think that young people today have the capacity and the ability to do much more than what we did. They're smarter. They have unbelievable opportunities to use what they have. If we had an iPad, Facebook, cellular telephone - I don't know what we would have been able to do. We only had a old mimeograph machine. We didn't even have a fax machine, but we did what we had to do.__EOS__ Is there anything you think they don't get, though, that you wish they would understand?",3
52568," So the heat wave begins Tuesday, August 4th, lasts for 10 days. Give us a sense of the intensity of these conditions as compared to heat waves that people experience today. __EOS__ I mean, this past summer we've had quite a few heat waves, you know, three days, maybe five days. This was 10 days, 90 degrees at street level, 90 percent humidity, temperatures not even dropping at night. Sometimes the temperatures don't even drop below 90 degrees until well into the evening. No wind, so at night there's just absolutely no relief whatsoever. __EOS__ And what are some of the things that happened to people living through that kind of heat and humidity in these conditions? __EOS__ I mean, one of the simplest things that the New York City government could have done was to lift the ban on sleeping in parks during the night. So people could have gone to Central Park and tried to get a, you know, breath of fresh air. ",0
52569," You know, that's a slam on all the autoworkers. And listen, I've worked in the factories myself. I don't buy that for a second. Yeah, maybe way back when, but I don't buy that for a second these days. These people are highly motivated. They know what their competition is. They know Toyota, Honda et al. are breathing down their necks. I just don't see those kinds of problems anymore. And if you go to the J.D. Power data, for example, it backs that up. The highest ranked automotive plant in North America, ahead of Toyota, in fact, is the General Motors plant in Oshawa, Canada. So you can absolutely build very high-quality vehicles with union labor. And there's just a lot of perception that's dragged on from decades past. __EOS__ Matt… __EOS__ For how long is that quality there? If I am showed statistics that say that I have a Lexus or a Toyota or a Honda that outperforms these vehicles year after year; if my vehicle's going to be new for 36 months compared to something that's going to be new for 12 months, which car do you think I'm going to buy? And what are these people's incentives to work harder if they're sitting in limbo thinking is Chrysler going to be picked apart like you guys are talking about? __EOS__ Matt, the Lexus, I think we're talking about a different price range. But anyway, thanks very much for the call. Appreciate it. ",3
52570," Paul, according to all the reviews and stuff that are written of the band, and they're like  He looks like your high school history teacher or he looks like Drew Carey...__EOS__ Bottom-line is we're a bunch of kind of nerdy-looking white guys. And when this sort of Earth-shaking soul roar comes out of his mouth for the first time, I mean you can always hear the air being sucked out of the room.__EOS__  And you just got, you just got to, you just got to...__EOS__ Believe it or not, Paul Janeway wasn't raised to be a soul singer. But his story is familiar somehow. He grew-up in rural Alabama in a strict religious household.",2
52571," You know, you had a very happy childhood, even though you'd never ever want to go back to being a child. Why wouldn't you want to go back to that era, even though you had a happy childhood? __EOS__ I had - well, I had what, I had a beautiful childhood and a lovely childhood. I just didn't like being a child. I didn't like the rank injustice of not being listened to. I didn't like the lack of autonomy. I didn't like my chubby little hands that couldn't manipulate the world of objects in the way that I wanted them to. Being a child for me was an exercise in impotent powerlessness. I just wasn't - and I was never terribly good at that kind of no-holds-barred fun. I mean, you know, I've essentially made a career on not being good at no-holds-barred fun. But, you know, I just never sort of like, hey, yes, let's go play. __EOS__ I was always more sort of like, does everybody know where the fire exit is and let's make sure there's enough oxygen in this elevator. So I just never really loved being a child, even though all of the attributes and perquisites were so in place. I had a gorgeous, gorgeous childhood, and yet I just didn't like being there. You know, just not for me. __EOS__ You write that you feel like you were mentally calibrated to be - what was the age? It 37 or 42 or... ",3
52572,"  Get out of my way, kid.__EOS__  What? Wait a minute. All right, let him talk.__EOS__   talk. I am done listening to this  talk. Now get out of my way.__EOS__  He's got something you need to hear, all right?",3
52573," So we're standing looking into the president's box, the very spot, the very seat that Lincoln sat in. This is a little vestibule. It's a private little place.__EOS__ We're now experiencing just what John Wilkes Booth did. It was in this space in the dark that Booth waited, listening to the dialogue from the play. It was like a ticking clock, four actors onstage now, now three, now two. Now only Harry Hawk alone stands onstage and he's about to say a funny line that's going to cause the whole audience to break out in laughter, which Booth hopes will muffle the sound of his shot. Booth has in his left hand his bowie knife. In his right hand he clutches the derringer pistol. He hears that line, and he levels his right hand and almost touches the back of Lincoln's head with the derringer pistol, and fires.__EOS__ He would have to have been skilled. It was pretty far down there.__EOS__ Yeah, it's about an 11-foot drop. Then Booth ran to center stage. This was his final and greatest performance on the American stage. So he raised his bloody dagger in the air and he cried out the state motto of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis - thus always to tyrants. And then he cried out, The South is avenged! And just as he exited from the stage, he was heard distinctly to say, I have done it! And then he vanished into the wings.",0
52574," OK. So one of the standard shots that you'd have to do is, like, you're the bad guy, and you're being shot, and you have to fall. __EOS__ Uh-huh. You mean fall off the horse or fall off of what? __EOS__ Fall of a balcony, fall off a horse, fall off a rock. You've fallen off all of them. So say, like, you're falling, you're shot, you're falling off from a height. So when you started making westerns, what protection was there for you to fall onto? __EOS__ Well, when I started, and that's a long time ago, they would take sawhorses, you know, like carpenters use. They'd take those, and they'd put one-by-12, pine one-by-12's across the top, put some cardboard boxes underneath it and put a mattress or two on top of it, and that's what saved you from being killed because the boards would bend about six inches, and then they'd all break, and then the boxes would catch you. So that's what you had, and believe me, 45 or 50 feet off of that, into those, about all you could handle. ",1
52575,"  Too high, too fast, gonna break our necks. Everything about you screamed of godly intersex. Nothing offered per dash, no human tracks. The new forms were germinating, I saw your REO wax. __EOS__ Kevin Barnes, I guess if William S. Burroughs were a black soul singer from the '70s, he might sound a little bit like David Bowie. You're getting a lot of David Bowie comparisons. Are you okay with that? I mean, do you hear it, too? I mean, I do, and I mean, I'm wondering if there's no way not to hear it. __EOS__ Yeah. I mean, you know, David Bowie's one of my heroes without question. And I never really claimed to be an original. You know, I'm just trying to combine these different influences  Parliament, Sly & The Family Stone, Prince, David Bowie, T. Rex, you know, The Beatles, Talking Heads, whatever it is. __EOS__ It's interesting that you mention the performance side of Of Montreal, because you may have heard a series that we're running on NPR called NPR's 50 Great Voices, and we had a story on Freddie Mercury of Queen - the late Freddie Mercury - and we asked our listeners, you know, is there anybody out there who's kind of taken on his mantle? And quite a few people mentioned you. ",2
52576," He has determined that playing - going into the street is some kind of a game. And so he will go outside and make beelines into the street getting me to chase him. And when I catch him, he's laughing. So he obviously thinks it's funny. I've tried timeouts. I've tried schooling him. Short of keeping him out of the front yard, that's the only thing that seems to keep the behavior from happening.__EOS__ One of the hallmarks is - of the work is you were in the home you got to see a lot. So understand that you can't possibly have the full picture here, but what is your advice for Jen just based on what you've heard here?__EOS__ You know, you can't - people look to train a child to know how to behave outside and how to be kept safe by giving them timeouts and by controlling their behavior, rather than understanding that it's an education to be able to understand the trust that's built between you and your child and being able to be out in public with them and know that they can be kept safe but actually trust that they're not going to run into the road.__EOS__ So what would you recommend that she should do here? Would she say - she should praise him when he's listening? Or...",0
52577," Yeah, I think that's right because, you see, if you accept that first position, and I know a lot of people on the United States side of the Atlantic do actually believe this. If you accept that position, you also have to accept that the whole process of negotiation in the United Nations, starting in September, and effectively running all the way up to the eve of war, that all of that was a fig leaf, and was entirely fraudulent. __EOS__ I want you to describe for us a bit the institution of the British career diplomat, who actually gets to be Ambassador to the United States. Something almost, almost unheard of working the other way. We would naturally assume that you would have given a tremendous amount of money to the prime minister's reelection campaign to have gotten the embassy here, because that's how you'd get the embassy over there. __EOS__ Well, you know, there's so many ways in which you can measure the difference between the American political tradition, and the British political tradition. I mean, you join the diplomatic service, and if you're any good you get promoted through the ranks, and in the end you become an ambassador. And fortunately you do not have to pay Tony Blair any money to get the job. In fact, you hope that he will pay you a reasonable amount of money to do the job. __EOS__ You describe how having started out as a Russia specialist in the foreign office, when in America and when studying at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, you came to the idea that, really, Britain should have America specialists. It should train people to try to understand us. ",0
52578," ...you write in Gikuyu, as I do...__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ ...then you find there are no publishers to bring out the books in Gikuyu language. It's not a simple solution. But anyway, when I was put in prison in 1977-'78, I decided to write in Gikuyu and that's when I wrote my first novel in Gikuyu, ""Devil on the Cross."" It's the one which I wrote on toilet paper because it was the only writing material that was accessible to me. But the reception, despite all those problems, when eventually I came out of the maximum-security prison, after protest from all over the world, the reception was really great, despite problems or literacy, the book was read in people's houses, in buses, you know, people would collect together and read it. That was for me was very, very, very encouraging. And not even that, previous to the novel ""Devil on the Cross,"" and the reason why I was put in prison was quite frankly, a play which my friend, the late Ngugi wa Mirii wrote in Gikuyu language, in which was performed by a village community in our language. Now, this was so empowering to the community, but the state - the postcolonial state, not the colonial state, but the postcolonial state - banned the play...__EOS__ Mmm.",0

Now you wear your skin like iron and your breath's as hard as kerosene. __EOS__ Townes Van Zandt died of a heart attack in 1997. He was 52 and had lived hard. Years of alcoholism took a toll. He inspired a generation of younger songwriters. And no doubt his most devoted protege was Steve Earle, who became a lifelong friend and has just released an album of Townes Van Zandt songs. __EOS__  Pancho is a bandit boy, his horse as fast as polished steel, wore his gun outside his pants. __EOS__ Steve Earle remembers crashing a party in 1972 as a teenager and falling under the Townes Van Zandt spell.

52581," And one question that keeps coming up again and again, is this the same man? Are these two different men? __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ Well, in one sense of course they're not. But are they the same? And in what way are they different, if they are different? You're absolutely right. Many of the things that McNamara says could've come out of anti-war demonstrators. It could've been things that they said verbatim in 1965. People who really hate McNamara, and they are many, when they hear about the lessons, they say, why do we want to hear anything this man says? Shouldn't he remain silent? My answer is an emphatic no. He has been so much a part of history, and the stories that he tells about history are really interesting and important stories. And they're stories by a man who knows. __EOS__ You know, you're talking about him being like the 85-year-old McNamara talking to the 40-year-old or 45-year-old McNamara. And I felt as a viewer that there were like, there were two versions of me watching the movie... ",1
52582," This is 1950s? __EOS__ I would say '58, '60, around in there, yeah. __EOS__ And were you all confident that the three of you were going to make it? __EOS__ There was a certain naive confidence, a sanguine kind of thing. Like, we were going to make it, but we didn't know if we were going to make it. But, you know, we started out in the theater, stage actors. And, yeah, we used to gather at Cromwell's Drugstore at 50th and - oh, I think it's 50th and 6th Avenue. And if we mentioned Brando's name once, we'd mention it 25 times in a day. He was kind of like our guy, you know, that we looked to. And we had our dreams and our aspirations, and I guess we were confident. ",1
52583," Oh, interesting. __EOS__  I said, watch out, I ain't lying, I ain't lying, 'cause baby... __EOS__ Can I see your hands? Where are your calluses? __EOS__ Well, they're a little bit... ",2
52584," We should qualify that, shouldn't we? There are plenty of people who have a degree of English, but maybe not a great depth in English? __EOS__ Yeah, but what I'm saying - yes, I completely agree with you - these 90 percent of Latinos who are bilingual, some of them are completely fluent in English, some of them can just say a few words, and some of them are taking lessons. But the fact is that the majority of Latinos can perfectly communicate in English. __EOS__ Could you envision a future in which English disappears in the United States? __EOS__ In many streets, it already has disappeared. I mean, if you walk in Little Havana, in Gayuochu, in Miami, or in some places - in Pilson, in Chicago, or even in New York or in Los Angeles - English has disappeared. I mean, it doesn't mean that you cannot find people who communicate in English, but in many communities, English simply is not needed. ",3
52585," Let's see if we can get some callers on the line. Terry's with us, Terry calling form Minnesota. __EOS__ Hi, Neal. This is my kind of show. __EOS__ Oh, good. __EOS__ Say, I like that 300 myself. And maybe your guest could talk about, I believe it's the Crossfire, just a really sharp, little two-door. But I was telling your screener, I tell you right now, I'm 53 years old and what I really miss, really miss is an old Charger with a 440 six-pack and a Muncie 4-speed. I'll tell you what… ",3
52586,"  Lemon.__EOS__  I'm on top of the Tracy thing. I just spoke to him.__EOS__ Actually, I want to talk to you about something else. Because of my unfortunate situation with Avery, I'm alone. And I know of course that you're not seeing anyone. Therefore I've decided that you and I should become friends with benefits.__EOS__ No, thank you, please.",1
52587," Yeah? __EOS__ I do. I'm very bad with equipment, though. I really - there's so much you can't see with the naked eye. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ And astronomers, especially amateur astronomers, are so generous. If anybody wants to see the planets through a telescope, there's always an amateur group ready to have a public viewing night. And they would just love to show you something through their telescope.

52589," Exactly. And it seems like audacity had skipped a generation. __EOS__ Now what have you thought as you have watched the revolution, specifically in your country? I think you told someone a few months ago you're consumed by this story. __EOS__ It's a moment of dramatic transition. It's embedded in. It's also a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety. But what is certain, is that people have glimpsed another possibility. They have just a very quick glimpse of what it might be to live in a just and dignified way. And that might take a long time to be realized, but I believe that once you see that, once the people see that it's impossible to erase it. __EOS__ When was the last time you were in Libya? ",0
52590," Oh, every once in a while I'll get a call - I'll be on, you know, I'll be on a jazz radio station someplace, and we'll be talking about my version of John Coltrane's ""Resolution"" - and this is the second movement from his great master work, ""A Love Supreme"" - and you know, walking into it, I felt a very keen sense of obligation and duty to the history of that piece to what I consider to be Coltrane's intention about ""A Love Supreme."" __EOS__ What's your process when you're choosing material? __EOS__ It's just stuff that I fall in love with, the same as any jazz fan, same as any music fan. And you know, since I'm on the road, the iPod is happening, so I'm always listening and always falling in love with pieces that I haven't heard before or being reminded of things that I was in love with when I was in high school or college or last year, and certain things stay with you. __EOS__ I have to admit I was taken aback a little bit when I was listening to the CD, and all of a sudden I heard you singing The Guess Who's 1969 pop hit, ""Undone.""

52591,"  Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you? Aldo the Apache and the Little Man? __EOS__  The German's nickname for me is the Little Man? __EOS__  And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life. I mean you are a little fellow, but not circus midget little. __EOS__ And we also hear, of course, one of Brad Pitt's soldiers there as well. ",1
52592," No, no, getting to the front line is very easy, unlike any other conflict. Syria, you know, you just cross the border from Turkey, you take a car, you have to wait in different outposts for the rebels until you reach the front lines. So logistically, it's very easy  You just meet the rebels and you drive with them.__EOS__ In what way? What makes this particularly striking?__EOS__ There is no front line in the sense of a front line that is a line defending - people defending the line, people attacking, people coming back. It's a very, very fluid situation. People are fighting over, you know, streets, alleyways. They move from one building to the other. So the whole concept of front line is misleading in a way.__EOS__ And we should explain the context here. You were, for this front line, in the city of Aleppo, which is a large city in northwestern Syria, right, relatively close to the Turkish border, right?",3
52593," Thank you.__EOS__ Bye-bye. Let's go next to Guillermo, Guillermo with us from Oakland.__EOS__ Yes, thank you for taking my call. I just wanted to say congratulations . My teacher, when I came to this country, my teacher taught us how to learn English with your book and how to write, how to speak, also helped us to graduate.__EOS__ You're talking about ""The House on Mango Street""?",0
52594," Actually, we discovered it because a retailer called us and said that he had heard that. At which point we pulled the product off the line and have now replaced it with one that we know is our president because the original is of him standing next to Secretary of State Clinton. __EOS__ So, I just want to scale back. You had no idea - no one noticed that the hands reaching out of that dark suit were white? __EOS__ Well, because they're not - I mean, I'm Caucasian, and they're not as white as my skin. And we've sold tens of thousands of them and had every nationality purchase them and never had any black people call and say that it wasn't a black person's hands. So, we had no idea. __EOS__ So help me understand the process and how this could happen - how Barack Obama's head could wind up atop someone else's body in one of these cardboard cutouts. ",3
52595," Yes. I do believe that we can achieve a fair process. And I think we're off to a great start. Senator Seliger has been very open to proposals and very gracious in considering the proposals that we and others have put forward. And on the House side there is also an openness. We're seeing public hearings and so far, you know, we think the process is working very well. __EOS__ Nina Perales is the director of litigation for MALDEF, the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. She joined us from her office in San Antonio. Also with us, Kel Seliger. He is the chair of the Texas state Senate's redistricting committee. He is a Republican. He's serving his second term.

52596," Well, you know, one thing that was actually funny is Franco Nero, from that point in time after ""Django"" through the '60s, and all through the '70s - him and Alain Delon were like, the two most popular leading men in Europe at that time. But the thing that was so funny was in particular, in Germany, the ""Django"" movie was so popular that any movie that Franco Nero did was retitled ""Django Something - in Germany."" He did a whole series of cop movies directed by Enzo G. Castellari, the guy who directed the original ""Inglourious Basterds""; including one called ""High Crime,"" which was sort of their ""French Connection"" and started a whole line of what they call polizia movies, in Italy. Well, but in Germany, it was called ""Django the Cop.""__EOS__ So in your Django movie, ""Django Unchained,"" Jamie Foxx is a slave who is freed during the course of the movie, and his name is Django. And the kind of catchphrase, the trademark phrase from the movie is, somebody asks him his name, and he says Django; the D is silent.__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ That's great. So can you talk a little bit about coming up with that line? I doubt that line is in the original ""Django.""",1
52597," So he got the idea that he was going to mass produce these toothpicks up in New England. Unfortunately, he was not much of an inventor himself. So what he did is he found an inventor who invented machines that did similar things - in fact made what were called shoe pegs. Shoe pegs were used in the middle of the 19th century to fasten the tops to the bottoms of shoes. __EOS__ Oh. __EOS__ They'll… __EOS__ Short little pegs. ",0
52598," And you're at the piano, playing and singing. It's quite beautiful. Do you want to say anything about making this recording before we hear it? __EOS__ Well, I just want to say, Terry, that I never would have continued singing at all if it hadn't been for you. Because you did an interview with Ralph and me in 1989, I think it was, when ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" opened on Broadway. And you played a little recording of me singing ""The Trolley Song,"" and I was just about to stop singing because I wasn't getting all that much encouragement. __EOS__ Ooh, I like your singing; I like it a lot. And that thrilled me so that I kept on singing. __EOS__ Well, it thrills me to hear you say that. ",2
52599," Well, it's a third-degree felony in the state of Utah. So it's a serious crime, and it's nothing to be taken lightly for sure. The present attorney general has stated that he will not prosecute consenting adults, of which we feel we fall into that. But it's still a crime, and it still can be and has been used as a weapon against our people, and it's really a weapon of fear. __EOS__ And it's very real for us because we've all had grandfathers who have spent time in prison for practicing polygamy. So it isn't something that we take lightly. We really understand. __EOS__ We're talking with Joe and Alina Darger. Along with two other women, they form a plural family, and they are not connected to the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints nor with the Fundamental Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints. They call them independent. __EOS__ Yeah, hi, I just wanted to say it's unfortunate that people push their views on other people, like the Mormons, you know, if somebody has a single-family marriage that they would push that on others. My husband is from Somalia. His dad has three wives not because he was some  or something, because it was a necessity there. The men only lived to be 40 due to the wars, and the women have to have children because they can't work. ",0
52600," Your parents were followers of a group called Children of God, which I've read a little bit about and sounds like it was like an evangelizing, almost a cult group?__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ And that the founder saw himself as a prophet. And so the first few years I think of your life you were living in Puerto Rico, but your family also traveled around South America - maybe prophesying?__EOS__ Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. They were introduced to this group through a friend of theirs that occasionally would come down and I think that those groups, they never - I don't think they ever, like, announce themselves as cults. I think that...",1
52601," It's important for people to recognize that there have been over 700 men held at Guantanamo since President Bush opened the detention facility in January 2002. The Bush administration released over 500 people. We don't have a lot of transparency on how the decisions that they made. At the moment, there are about 223 left in Guantanamo. And you get different reports on how the administration has sorted through them, and it's very difficult to say exactly and perhaps administration officials will tell you. What I'm hearing is there are about 75 that are slotted for release or transfer. There are about 40 that are slated for prosecution. And there are about 110, depending on who you talk to, where they haven't made a decision about what they're going to do with these people. __EOS__ Well, just the ones who are slated for release or transfer, why are they still at Guantanamo? __EOS__ Because it's a very complicated process of negotiating with friends and allies around the world to take people. And frankly, the fact that we haven't taken anybody for release in some ways has held things up. But it's just - it's simply, you know, there's one person - Ambassador Daniel Fried at the State Department - whose main job is negotiating with countries all over the world to take folks. And he's actually been the good news part of the story. __EOS__ Is this just a garden variety case of campaign promise easily articulated, comes face-to-face with the complex reality of actually governing and being in office? Or is it unique? ",3
52602,"  Yeah.  No, the music is really about quiet intensity,      about expressivity but in a minimalist setting, and music to me has to be      elegant, subtle and relaxed, but also has to be very intense, and that's      when I feel music is really flowing, when there are no gaps here, when we      can bridge these somewhat paradox-ridden tensions. __EOS__  The title track of your new CD, also the last track from the CD,      is called ""The Ground."" __EOS__  Certainly a lot of gospel sound there... __EOS__  Yeah. ",2
52603," Well, you talk about, in going to the services and in going to prayer groups at this Vineyard church, how you felt that people were training their minds to perceive God? And you attended prayer training classes. What are some of the things you learned to do in prayer training classes?__EOS__ Prayer, in this context, is in an imagined conversation with God. That doesn't mean that you're treating God as imaginary. It means that you're using your imagination to have a back-and-forth interaction with God. And what people are first invited to do is to experience what I would call a new theory of mind.__EOS__ How were you supposed to tell the difference between God actually speaking to you and you using your imagination to manufacture a conversation with God?__EOS__ Well, that was tough, and one of the things I was so impressed by was how thoughtful people were about the process. But basically, the church taught people what they would call a style of discernment. So what thoughts - you know, what thoughts are good candidates for God's thoughts?",3
52604," And let's talk next about Afghanistan, where Americans face questions about what kind of behavior they will tolerate from their Afghan allies. Journalist Matthieu Aikins has spent years reporting from southern Afghanistan. __EOS__ He's a very much sort of rags to riches character who started as a small shopkeeper living in exile in Pakistan during the Taliban period and has ascended to the most dizzying heights of wealth and power and this warlord character, as a result of the dynamics that were unleashed after the U.S. invaded in 2001. So he became the head of this tribal militia that controlled a key border crossing between Kandahar and southern Afghanistan and Pakistan.  __EOS__ So if you're the guy who has some gunmen who can control that area and extract a little bit of money from every truck driver going through, you can become a rich man.  __EOS__ You're sitting on a gold mine. And of course the other thing is that he oversaw the most dramatic expansion of the opium trade in history. ",3
52605," For 25 years I was painfully married to a pathological person. I feel a responsibility to tell my story. It will help other women. Problem  My ex-husband is the father of my children. They don't know what happened when they weren't there. __EOS__ Such a great dilemma  What are other people going to think? And I always advise people not to ever write a tale of revenge. Trying to get revenge on somebody - or not to write it because of getting revenge on someone. Writing that is a trip to nowhere. __EOS__ You may not feel comfortable doing it right now, publishing it right now, Elaine, but I encourage you to write it right now because you will learn so much about how you feel and about the decisions that you made. __EOS__ And one of the lessons you repeat in the book  tell the truth.

Secret intelligence operations require stealing other people's secrets, breaking into their houses, tapping their telephones, reading their email.__EOS__ So after writing this history of the FBI, have you asked for your FBI dossier through the Freedom of Information Act?__EOS__ I'm not willing to wait 26 years to get it, unlike the Hoover files that were given to me. But I think it'll be short. You know, I think it will largely touch on the issues that came up while I was covering the CIA. I know there are some leak investigations in there.

52607,"  Oh, can't you see, can't you see that you're mine? 'Cause I know that, baby, you're mine.__EOS__ And that first song and that first rehearsal was so magical that I walked out of the room. I called the Hotel Cafe, which is this famous singer-songwriter place in LA, and came in the room and told everybody, we got a show next week. And everyone's like, um, we don't even have enough songs. And I go, well, we better get cracking. The week after that, we did our first show in front of 50 of our closest friends. And it was crazy. Like, we were such a young band. We had literally done, I think, six or seven shows, and we had actually done a performance on the LA-based KCRW station.__EOS__ Fitz and the Tantrums live on KCRW - great way to wrap up our workweek, you guys are blowing up the spot.__EOS__ Well, thank you.

You've got one of the worst reputations in this town, Michael. Nobody will hire you.__EOS__  Are you saying that nobody in New York will work with me?__EOS__  Oh no, that's too limited. Nobody in Hollywood wants to work with you, either. I can't even send you up for a commercial.

52609," Well, I know you built Theremins, and we'll get to that in a couple of minutes. What else did you build?__EOS__ Back in the '40s and early '50s, building simple electronic projects was a popular hobby of many people. Back then, you could buy, you know, a few parts and - with tubes and build something on your kitchen table, and it would actually work.__EOS__ I think your father was an amateur radio operator?__EOS__ Yes, he was. He was a professional engineer. He worked for Consolidated Edison in New York City.",2
52610," Thank you. __EOS__ Thank you. We're so happy to be here. __EOS__ When did you first hear about the MOF? __EOS__ Well, we first heard about the MOF from a friend of ours, Fleur Lazar, who graduated from the French Pastry School in Chicago. And she told us about one of the founders of the school, Jacquy Pfieffer, and how he was practicing for this epic competition, the Meilleurs Ouvriers de France. And his business co-partner, Sebastien Canonne, had already competed in this contest and had the coveted collar. So, the stakes were incredibly high for Jacquy. ",1
52611," Did you find that any students reached out to you or were there those that try to hold up in this? xxx __EOS__ Did you find that any students reached out to you? Were there those that tried to hold you up in this? __EOS__ There were some that were on the quiet side that reached out, especially in classes that - such as gym class or my lab partner in biology, when we were, you know, put together. Then we had to work together. And there were a number of people, but again, they could not be outwardly friendly with me. __EOS__ It's hard to imagine having to worry about sitting on a tack every day, all day, every class. ",0
52612," Yeah. Right. Yeah.__EOS__ Meaning what?__EOS__ It was, it was based on Lisa, honestly. That was what was funny about it is that I had this vocal pattern - Lisa's very - she's a real California girl, you know? She was, you know, grew up out there. She lives out there now. She has a very relaxed way of speaking. I love her language, that thing like, you know, sort of getting all grubby and that kind of business. And she has a laconic, kind of laconic tone that I was aping for this, actually. And she was like oh, I like that like lesbian surfer thing. And I'm like it's you, Lisa.__EOS__ And, you know, that also there were a lot, I wore a lot of Lisa's girlfriends T-shirts in the movie and some of her jewelry. And, you know, whenever you play a character you try to personalize them, you know, in one way or another. And sometimes, you know, what you're looking at - your research is really close to you, you know, and you're like hey, can I wear that shirt?",1
52613," Well, I think that it's important, I mean, and my goal, of course, as a director, is that there is always immediate connection between the audience and the stage, and I think that we have to have convincing enough opera singers, who make you believe that they're communicating that text to you in a way that you understand it, whether you literally understand the words or not. Anybody who's a great singer, a great actor, I think, can overcome that, and that's something that we accept in opera, I mean, Puccini, look at many of his greatest operas, LA BOHEME, those are a bunch of French Bohemians, yet they're singing in Italian. __EOS__ But you have a production right now going in London in which, in LA BOHEME, they're singing in English, and I gather, to big audiences. __EOS__ Yes, well, that's performing at the Royal Albert Hall, which has 5,000 seats a night. That is a definite goal of mine to create a much more of a popular outreach about opera, and one way to do that, I think, is to perform in the language of the audience. In that case, that is a situation where, because of the volume of the seats, the ticket prices are very low. The top price is only about $50.00, which is fantastic, and there are two casts. It's a big, spectacular production, so that part of it is about inviting a new audience in to see the epic nature of opera, as well as, of course, the great intimate story of LA BOHEME. __EOS__ You've also worked with Disney.

52614," He called up the administrator at Howard University? __EOS__ He called up Howard University. Yeah, because I - they were saying my grades were, you know. He called. He said, Robert, don't you know that most of your money comes from the federal government? And then he hung up. He says, you go on back up there and you see Mr. William Roberts. I got in to Howard University. __EOS__ Hmm. If you have somebody like Strom Thurmond, though, and he's giving these segregation speeches… __EOS__ You wonder how could he be so kind to me and say all these other bad things? Now, I'd be telling you a lie if I said some things he said didn't hurt me, if that's what you want to hear. He said it. But then again, I said, well, he'd done so much - the good outweighed the bad, the way I look at it. ",0

52616," Jagger has always struck a balance between careful studio craftsmanship and raw, spontaneous energy. __EOS__ He spoke of how he goes about trying to capture that elusive first-take quality. __EOS__ When you're recording, this is a very fine line to get something as good as you know you can get it - and as crafted as you want it. __EOS__ A lot of people do songs line by line.

52618," Another Chinese artist, I believe, says in the course of your documentary  Ai WeiWei has a hooligan side, so he knows the deal with other hooligans.__EOS__ Yeah, you know, I've definitely heard other people say, yeah, I thought of using that word when I was writing an article about him. I mean, I think part of his appeal and why his appeal goes beyond simply that of an artist, or simply that of an activist or a rights advocate, is I think because of his incredible sense of humor, the fact that he doesn't have to take himself so seriously all the time while, as you said, he is very genuine and very concerned about the issues that he's talking about. That's why he ends up having this appeal, has, you know, so many young followers online.__EOS__ There's a moment towards the very end of your film in which Ai WeiWei - who's been in a secret detention and he's been under interrogation for weeks and a couple of months, actually - he's released. And lots of reporters are waiting for him. And this man - who has been the epitome of rebelliousness, of in-your-face protests against the system - says I can't talk to you, I can't talk to you, I'm sorry. It's a condition of my release. I can't say anything.__EOS__ I think it was important to have that at the end because, first of all, this is a story that is constantly going on. So, in that moment, to see what really happened to him in that moment, that will never change. I mean, that day, as you said, he appears broken. He probably, you know, was to some regard. When he watched that footage himself, he said, My God, I didn't recognize myself. You know, I barely looked human.",1

How long? __EOS__  About 250 feet, and we had to do it in, like, 60-feet      increments, and so they would lay a cargo net up against the cliff, and      I'd have to literally grab it to stop myself, flying underneath it with      the double for Michael Douglas coming behind me with his big boots on.      And, you know, you do it over and over and over and over and over, and      you know, your chances of getting hurt start to quadruple, maybe.  You      just need to make the movie, and you just become a robot, almost, at that      point.  Terry Leonard, being my stunt coordinator, knew.  He look at my      eyes and he goes, `That's it.

And then, of course, I forgot but Sha Na Na was there. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ Which is kind of interesting... __EOS__ Do you ever think of Bowzer being at Woodstock? ",1
52623," Why do you prefer to listen to it in the car?__EOS__ Well, because the scene is always changing. It's the world's greatest video. And you're semi-occupied by, you know, driving the car. So your subconscious is wide open. Your conscious is busy, so you're not thinking about the music too much. You're just feeling it.__EOS__  Long may you run.__EOS__ I like that you say you've never been attracted to perfect or expensive or exotic cars. What is it that attracts you to a car?",0
52624," This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Viola Davis. She's nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal as a maid in Jackson, Mississippi, in the 1960s. She was also nominated for an Oscar for her performance in the 2008 film ""Doubt.""__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ You know, and in both movies you're in powerless positions.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.",1
52625," Well, there's a really great film by Sergio Arau called ""A Day Without A Mexican."" And it's a really  comedy or dramedy about what would we do, you know, without these guys. There isn't anybody that is willing to do that work for that money. So I totally understand both sides, you know, because people are afraid, and those problems are this information about how you are fear can increase if your neighbor looks like this or does that or is here with no documents and stuff, and all that. And then my biggest fear is that, fear plus ignorance, only gives you hate and that's where, you know, real problems can happen. __EOS__ Demian Bichir is the star of the film ""A Better Life."" It's being released on DVD this month, and he was kind enough to join us from NPR West in Culver City, California. Demian Bichir, thank you so much for joining us. __EOS__ Thank you very much. __EOS__ And that's our program for today. And whether you've been listening from the beginning or just found us today, we'd love to hear from you. To tell us more, please go to npr.org and find us under the programs tab. You can also friends be on Facebook and follow us on Twitter at TELL ME MORE/NPR. I'm Michel Martin you've been listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News and the African-American Public Radio Consortium. Let's talk more tomorrow.   Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",1
52626," What is next for you? I mean what do you see for yourself?__EOS__ You know, one of the reasons want to host ""America Revealed"" is that as far as I know this is a first national show about America that's been hosted by an Asian-American man. And it's interesting, because even over the course of filming this, you know, I go to parts of the country and people would be sort of shock that I was a host, and they'd ask me questions like so, you know, where you from? Like, I'm from D.C. Like, no, no, no. Where you really from? And then they would compliment me on speaking English so well. And then I tell them yeah, I've been, you know, cramming for a whole year.__EOS__ It all paid off. But I still think, you know, there's this perception - especially for Asian-Americans - that we're perpetual foreigners, that because we look different people just assume that we're not American. And what I'd like to do is to use media to get to a point where people will just look at us as Americans as opposed to Asian-Americans, or African-Americans, or any other kind of subcategory, but first and foremost we're Americans.__EOS__ Yul Kwon is the host of Link TVs news programs ""Link Asia."" And as he mentioned, he just finished hosting the PBS documentary series ""America Revealed."" And he was kind enough to join us here in our Washington, D.C. studios.",3
52627," Another thing that was very interesting about the Bulger household growing up is their father had lost his arm in an accident. And so he had difficulty finding work. So not only were they living in the projects, but that money, you know, money was tight.__EOS__ All right, so as Whitey becomes a prominent criminal, Billy does very well and eventually becomes one of the most powerful people in the Massachusetts legislature. But let's go back to in Whitey's criminal career. He becomes a bank robber, gets caught, and at age 26 gets a lengthy prison sentence, ends up doing part of it at Alcatraz.__EOS__ Well, you know, timing is everything, and when you look at it, Whitey was able to emerge from prison to a very depleted underworld. There were over 60 people killed, mostly Irish gangsters, while he was away in prison. And so he was able to rise very quickly.__EOS__ There's this fascinating episode when a federal court ordered the integration of the Boston school system, which meant, you know, busing kids to achieve racial balance from one community to another, and it meant some African-American kids being bused into South Boston.",0
52628," You had a couple of other suggested titles for the book. __EOS__ Well, my favorite, which the editors summarily dismissed, was ""Farewell to Legs,"" ""A Farewell to Legs."" I thought that was perfect, you know. Had that little Hemmingway twist, but they didn't like that. And ""Spinal Destination"" was also… __EOS__ I like that one. __EOS__ My kid came up with that one, ""Spinal Destination."" They said, nah, you never want to use the word spine in a book title. That's not good. People don't pick up books that have the word spine in them or death. Best is good. Having the word best is a good word. ",0
52629," Indeed, I'm telling you, I had a great - but I have prioritized the issues that government should address. We have agreed that as a government, we will be addressing the restoration of the basic utilities - electricity, energy in the country and water supply. We can improve on our social service delivery system. That is also terrible. With energy, we can unlock the opportunities for the improvement of our economy, thereby turning around the economy. __EOS__ One of the other steps that you have taken is to declare zero-tolerance for corruption. Why is that so important? __EOS__ Well, it is important because one of the cancers of our society and the reasons why we have not made any impact, even in the light of the support from both the international community and the Sierra Leoneans and also the resilience shown by the Sierra Leoneans is that corruption has eaten away all of the efforts. And I believe that if we are able to send the right signals by putting up a very robust fight against corruption, it will ensure all of it will be improved substantially. __EOS__ I'm told that as part of this anti-corruption effort, you have declared that all public officials will have to declare their assets. They'll have to make public their assets. Have you done this yet? ",3
52630," I take the view that the dog is an evolutionary inevitability, that as soon as wolves and humans met on the trail of big game, they started traveling together, and they've been at it ever since. I say that because there are wolves who are highly sociable, just as there are humans who are highly sociable. And those two highly sociable individual animals, in many cases, could get together. And from that, could rise all kinds of relationships.__EOS__ Now, I notice that when you're discussing this early relationship between dogs - or dogs' ancestors - and our ancestors from prehistory - early humans - you prefer the term dog-wolves or dog-like wolves to wolf-dogs. What's the distinction you're making?__EOS__ The distinction I'm making is that there were some wolves, I believe, who were indeed dog-like; that is, they were highly sociable to humans; they liked to hang around humans; and they ultimately settled down, in a way, in that they might have a litter of pups near the human society.__EOS__ When humans began associating with wolves - you know, back many thousands of years ago - and then, of course, physical changes occurred that made these creatures the dogs that we know today. What were some of the changes that came with living with humans?",3
52631," Now, Jenna Fischer, who plays Pam - the receptionist on the show - was recently on our show.__EOS__ Horrible woman.__EOS__ Yeah. She was so dull. Ugh.__EOS__ Isn't she awful? Yeah.",3
52632," How'd you get your start? I hear - I don't know if this is true - that you had wanted to be a minister originally. Is that true? __EOS__ I did. That was my first ambition in life was to be a Baptist minister. Somewhere along the line, George Clinton turned me out and here I am. __EOS__ What happened? __EOS__ I was - I worked in my mother's record shop - my mother owned record shop from the time I was, I guess, 12 years old. And people used to come in there all the time and go - you know, I had this heavy voice from the time I was, wow, eighth grade. The summer between the seventh and eighth grade, my voice changed. And so people would come in and say, yeah, you sound like a deejay or you aught to be a deejay. All the time. And it was in one ear and out the other, you know. ",2
52633," Did you think it was about a vampire gardener when he first approached you? __EOS__ Yeah, Chris always tells that story about our first meeting because I went in to read for ""New Moon,"" and then, you know, he started talking about this gardener. So he jokes about me saying  So is this a gardener that is a vampire? Or how does this work? __EOS__ I don't know. I think Chris Weitz is one of those really fantastic, eclectic directors because he jumps from one genre to another with such ease. __EOS__ Well, you do too. I mean, you talk about jumping from genre to genre - you played Fidel Castro in ""Che,"" and many people might have seen you in the Showtime series ""Weeds,"" where you play Esteban Reyes, the drug-trafficking, you know, mayor. So you know, you do the same thing. What attracted you to this role? ",1
52634," Mm-hmm. __EOS__ Nick, it's great to talk to you again. Thanks so much. __EOS__ Thanks for having me. __EOS__ Nick Spitzer hosts the public radio program ""American Routes"" from New Orleans. ",2
52635," Yes, yes. A wonderful meeting. I got to go eat dinner with Bonnie and Maxine. And Bonnie started singing in the restaurant and it was utterly bewitching. I mean, all of the diners - it was, like, in this little catfish cabin. And, you know, diners are just chowing down, you know, shoving catfish and crumbs falling on the floor, everything. And, you know, it's just a high-volume restaurant. __EOS__ I'd be interested in that first encounter with Maxine when you maybe called her up and said I'd like to write a book about you and your siblings and talk to them. I'm trying to imagine her reaction. __EOS__ Boy, you know, it was backwards of that. I don't know if there's time to get into it here. I'll try and be quick. It was a backwards story. __EOS__ Rick Bass. His new novel is called ""Nashville Chrome."" He joined us from member station KUOW in Seattle, Washington. Thank you so much. ",2
52636,"  On! __EOS__  ...very touched and I don't think she realized that I had      a serious sort of interview in mind but we had a nice time. __EOS__   I went for a walk in my old downtown to the top      of a hill and I turned around.  Train yard's not what it used to be.      Station's still standing by the factory. __EOS__  The last track on your CD, this is an original, one of yours,      and it's written about your hometown, titled ""Nashville.""  Thinking about      your early days there, and growing up and all, do you feel as though      you've come a long way? ",2
52637," You know, it's the exact same thing. It wasn't making it mine, it, I'm a singer and that's the way I sing. It would have been virtually impossible for me to repeat Lucinda's rendition of it or make up a rendition that wasn't mine. That was the way I heard it and I was telling everyone when we first started working on it, I said, it's a shame, I would have to make the recording at least twice as long if I added all the places she went, which I also went, along with the ones that I did. __EOS__  Find joy. When I wake up  I was looking for my joy, went to New York and I was looking for my joy. Maybe in the apple I could find joy. Maybe in the apple I could find joy. Oh, my joy. __EOS__ So you've been a lot of places. You've been to Memphis, you've been to Muscle Shoals, you started in Detroit. Did you ever find joy or even get close in some of those places? __EOS__ Well, you do listen to it to the end, don't you, Debbie? It says so I went to West Orange. ",2
52638," Yeah. It wasn't forced on me. It was something I wanted to do. And ever since, I've never stopped, I've never stopped playing music. I never went through a period where I didn't want to do it. I've always loved it and it's always been a huge part of my life. __EOS__ There's a lot of aspiring songwriters, singers, musicians out there in the world. Could you say something that would inspire them? __EOS__ Well, you know, for me, no matter how much money you want to make off of singing, no matter what kind of fame you want to make, achieve, the most important thing to me is making music that you're proud of, making music that comes from you, comes from an authentic place in you. And if you do that, no matter how big or successful and famous you become, if you do that, that's the most fulfilling thing, is making music that you love and that you're proud of. __EOS__ So you teamed up Kanye for one song on this album, “Heaven.” ",2
52639," He loved opera, but it was hard enough just being a black singer, let alone a black opera singer. __EOS__  Here comes the night. __EOS__ ""The Night"" came out in 1960. It got up to number four on the Billboard Hot 100. Wilson cracked the pop top 10 just six times, but on the R&B charts, 15 of his songs made the top 10. One of his fans was Michael Jackson. In 1984, when Jackson collected seven Grammy Awards for his album ""Thriller,"" he stopped the applause to pay tribute. __EOS__ Some people are entertainers, and some people are great entertainers. Some people are followers, and some people make the path and are pioneers. I'd like to say, Jackie Wilson was a wonderful entertainer. ",2
52640," Absolutely.__EOS__ ...Ken, thanks. And of course there was a team in Baltimore called the Orioles that developed a young kid by the name of Babe Ruth.__EOS__ Oh, yeah. My grandfather lived around the corner from the Babe when he was a kid. He was five years older.__EOS__ Ken, thanks very much for the call. Appreciate it.",0
52641,"  La di da di.__EOS__ ...And back in the early 1990s, if you were a DJ in New York, like Mark was, it was a staple of your set.__EOS__  La di da di, we like to party. We don't cause trouble. We don't bother nobody. We're just some men that's on the mic.__EOS__ It's literally like Chapter 1 of the hip-hop DJ Bible. And it's an incredible song because it's just a beatbox and a rap over it.",2
52642," Who's a top aide to Hillary Clinton at the State Department.__EOS__ Who's a top - exactly, thank you. And - but, you know, John McCain said that's ridiculous. Then John Boehner said that's not appropriate. Then it was a whole sea of Republicans who said that's not really what we are about. And so my point is that it's not nearly as fashionable as it used to be to engage in that kind of rhetoric.__EOS__ What message would you want people to draw from this book? And we're really only scratching the surface of some of the very interesting stories that you tell, including on how you revealed your new faith commitment at Thanksgiving dinner, which I don't think is something you advise, right, to our other families who are embracing...__EOS__ Yeah, yeah.",0
52643," Absolutely. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ I would agree with you. You entered a children's singing contest? __EOS__ Yeah. I went to a couple of, you know, children singing competitions. Usually I forgot a word. I dont know, it was not a correct thing for me 'cause it was little bit silly to me. ",2
52644," Just getting the ratings. At one point in the film we see an editor shouting at his reporter in Hindi  Why didn't we have this story? This could be a live suicide. It will turn the election. And even if it doesn't, we'll get great ratings. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And toward the end the female reporter character, whose name is Nandita, she makes the same point  Audiences don't care about poor people, she says; they just want to hear more about this farmer who's threatened to commit suicide. __EOS__   Do you know why? Because he is the original live suicider. Do you have any idea how big this is? We're journalists and this is what we do. ",1
52645," Now, here it is 40 years later, and you sing about yourself. Let's listen to ""Tonight Again.""__EOS__  Ooh, it feels better the second time. Sure feels better the second time. Don't matter what Little Betty Wright said. That was then, this is now, and I say it sure is better the second time around.__EOS__ Betty, I love this. You actually say, don't matter what Little Betty Wright said. That was then, this is now. So what have you learned about love in your life?__EOS__ I learned that it doesn't love nobody. Somebody smart said that one time, right?",2
52646," Yes, he did. He wrote, you know, one serial back in the days when they had serials. Each week they would do small segments that, you know, came before the main feature. So he wrote one of those serials. But he claimed that he had written a number of other movies that he doesn't actually have credit for.__EOS__ So did writing movies remain a dream of his even when he became famous for ""Dianetics"" and then Scientology?__EOS__ Oh, all through his life he was fascinated by the whole moviemaking experience, and he wrote a script in 1979 called ""Revolt in the Stars"" that he hoped to have made, and that never went anywhere. And because he was spurned by Hollywood, he set up his own film studios at a compound in Southern California. And it mainly produced training films for Scientology, but he was constantly hoping to make it as a real screenwriter and a real director.__EOS__ My guest is Lawrence Wright, and he is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of a book about the history of al-Qaida called ""The Looming Tower."" He has a new book about Scientology and it's called ""Going Clear."" Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.",0
52647," And the stairs and the child are just surrounded by dark. So any time you're ready.__EOS__  Laszlo was afraid of the dark. The dark lived in the same house as Laszlo - a big place with a creaky roof, smooth, cold windows, and several sets of stairs. Sometimes the dark hid in the closet. Sometimes it sat behind the shower curtain. But mostly, it spent its time in the basement. All day long, the dark would wait in a distant corner, far from the squeaks and rattles of the washing machine, pressed up against some old, damp boxes and a chest of drawers nobody ever opened.__EOS__ You know, this book is an oddly reassuring book. The end is very reassuring. And I say oddly because your books are never reassuring.__EOS__ But I guess maybe this is because it's for a much younger child, and because you're a father and you child used to be three years old. Maybe you wanted it to be reassuring?",0
52648," Yeah. __EOS__ Oh, I think it's a candidate for one of the worst movies I ever saw. __EOS__ So, you know, a lot of... __EOS__ Its ridiculous. It's ridiculous. The only good thing in the movie was Natalie Wood. RIP. ",3
52649," My Revolution"" and it's a graphic novel. The story is set in the late 1950s when 17-year-old Sonya is about to set aside her dream of becoming an artist to join Fidel Castro as his rebels overthrow the government. Along the way, her life takes some challenging turns. __EOS__ I am so delighted to be here, Allison, you know, and really great that we can have a conversation. __EOS__ I am curious. Having read this, it's so visceral. There's so much blood. There's so much graphic - I mean, it was difficult to read. I wonder if it was difficult for you to write. __EOS__ It was quite difficult. I was living in New York. I left New York, came to Florida. And the reason why I did that was a sound, a smell, brings you back to memories when you were a child, of your first love, of your first relationship. ",0
52650," Yeah, the term drone has been used to cover what is really an extraordinary array of different, not only sizes, but shapes and forms and speeds and the like. So to give some examples, there are drones that are essentially the size of business jets and in fact are jet-powered and that are used by the U.S. military.__EOS__ So something that you could pull out of your trunk or a backpack, you launch it up, and it gives you, what, a clear, color picture, night vision, that kind of thing?__EOS__ All of the above. That's exactly right. I mean, it depends on the type of camera that's mounted on the platform. And they're not always airplanes in the sense of having, you know, propellers or jet engines. Helicopter drones are, you know, with that sort of - have rotors are common, as well, and in fact they were used by the Libyan rebels last summer in the events that occurred over there. So those are also - that's another class of drones.__EOS__ Now, you said there are also drones which fly way up high, like in the stratosphere, and are incredibly light, and did you say, can stay up for weeks, months?",3
52651," Yeah, she's furious with them and she's not playing by anybody else's rules under any circumstances. And just because you find her doesn't mean she's going to go with you. And as a 16-year-old now, she has choices. __EOS__ Yeah. Patrick finally says, when he's in the embrace of his family, that his blessings outweigh his regrets. Is that the sign of a life well lived? __EOS__ I think so. I think we might have this weird unrealistic expectation that we're supposed be happy. And I just don't think it works that way. I don't think it comes even close. But if you can get through life where the ledger is that you have a 101 blessings and 100 regrets, then on some level you won. You know, there's the great line from ""Hud""  Nobody gets out of this life alive. __EOS__ Mr. Lehane, thanks so much for all your time. ",0
52652," Yeah, that's really hard. __EOS__ You said that you wanted a Web series to be about the Web, and we should say it's set up that you see these two chat windows, sometimes one or the other, but it looks like a desktop, and there's sort of business around the side of the desktop that's also part of your character's  what she would have on her computer. I mean, it's all sort of set up to give you some insight into the character. __EOS__ Yeah, if you care to look at it, in the first season you see, you know, a folder for Lockman Brothers, which is some financial institution we made up that she was working at and then, you know, possibly was blackmailing them over some sexual harassment suit. That's how she's getting funded. __EOS__ Given that, I mean, other than its brevity, how do you feel about that medium? ",1
52653," Can you point me to some lyrics where that's the case?__EOS__ Every single one.__EOS__ Pretty much. I mean, I was having a hard time not writing about what was going on in my world, you know what I mean? Because it was just so completely taking over everything.__EOS__ You said you went through a breakup; what happened to you in the last year?",2
52654," He was everything I thought he was and an enormous amount more. You know, I wasn't expecting there to be ribald songs about prostitutes or Jewish songs and that felt like the Woody Guthrie I would have liked to imagine or invent if it wasn't real.__EOS__ Among the songs that Tweedy found in the archives and recorded was one called ""California Stars.""__EOS__ It was on a yellow piece of paper, with a blue ballpoint - he hadn't been to California in 10 years, at least, probably already knew he had Huntington's and he wished he could go back in time, stop the progress of an illness.__EOS__  I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight on a bed of California stars. I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight on a bed of California stars.",2
52655," In fact, when your father eventually decided to move out... __EOS__ I was heated. __EOS__ And you challenged him, how could you be leaving the people? __EOS__ I did. And you know what? He gave me probably the best answer you could. You know, my dad at the time was, I believe, about 42 years old. He said, son, I have never had a big backyard in my life. And I think I was about 14 or 15 years old. There was absolutely nothing I could say to that.  ",0
52656," As best she could. I think here you have to again, that goes back to the story and you have to understand who she was. You know, her mother died when she was 13 years old. She had five brothers and sisters and she was the middle child. And my father came along and married her when she was 17, brought her down to New Orleans and they had nowhere to live and nowhere to stay so she had never known how to support or take care of herself. And every time she would go to one of her aunts or people in her family, they would tell - and she would say what was going on, they would tell you that he's a good man, he has a job, you stay with him. And that was her experience in life and that is what she was taught and that is what she knew. So she did the absolute best that she could with the situation that she was given.__EOS__ Your mother stayed with your father in spite of, you know, how he could be brutal. Did you want them to - were you hoping that she would leave him and take him with her?__EOS__ Many times. Many times. And she did once or twice. But what was clear about it, is that she had no way to support four children, and as bad as things were, as bad of a person as he could be, the man with the provider. He provided. There was - the lights were never off. You know, we did have everything we wanted, but everything we needed was definitely met.__EOS__ What did he do for a living?",1
52657," Well, it's remarkable to discover that the CIA may have had Oswald under pretty aggressive surveillance in Mexico City. There were reports years later that there were photographs of Oswald in Mexico City that the CIA had taken. There were tape recordings of his telephone calls in Mexico City. And all of that evidence would later disappear. The tapes, the CIA would say, were erased and the photographs, they would claim, never existed, even though there's a fair amount of evidence to suggest they did.__EOS__ And what about the FBI? Did they have files on Mexico that they refused to share?__EOS__ Well, both the FBI and the CIA seemed determined not to get to the bottom of what Oswald did. Oswald was there for nearly six days. He apparently has encounters with Cuban spies and Cuban diplomats and Soviet spies and Mexicans who were sympathetic to Castro's revolution who had real reason to hope that President Kennedy's administration would be ended.__EOS__ Right. And one of the things that the commission did not know was that the U.S. government had already repeatedly attempted to have Fidel Castro assassinated.",0
52658," And the firehouse was literally next door to the boarding house that Ray was perched in? __EOS__ It's across the street. __EOS__ Okay. __EOS__ And again, is about, like, 200, maybe 250 feet away. ",0
52659," Thank you.__EOS__ Emerald, thank you so much for the phone call.__EOS__ Thank you.__EOS__ We're talking with India.Arie today. She's with us here with Chantae Cann and Ametria Dock, the backup singers. Blue Miller, guitarist and vocalist, also with us. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",2
52660," A gentlemen's bar. __EOS__ Gentlemen's bar, yes, and then has to figure out, well, what does he do. So he offers to, like - he sends a drink over, like the guy's going to be really impressed with that, like he needs a fan to buy him a drink. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ It's so kind of all wrong, his expectations, like, he's so removed. But to not give too much away, the football player ends up beating up the fan. ",1
52661," Though he was born in Mississippi, Landreth's father, an insurance agent, moved the family to Lafayette when he was young. And that's where Sonny began to drink in the music of South Louisiana. Eventually, he held the distinction of playing with what one admirer calls, ""The Holy Trinity of Acadian music""  songwriter and Cajun rocker, Zachary Richard, the Grammy-winning Cajun supergroup, Beausoleil, and the King of Zydeco, Clifton Chenier.__EOS__ People ask me about it and I liken it to if I'd grown up in Chicago and Muddy Waters had taken me under his wing. That's what it was like for me here in this part of the country.__EOS__ In the more than 35 years he's been in the music business, Landreth has been known chiefly as a sideman, playing in other bands and on other people's albums. But he's released nine CDs of his own. The most recent features Eric Clapton, Vince Gill and Jimmy Buffet.__EOS__  Air Force One had a heck of a view...",2
52662," I wonder if there might be something about the adult brain that might make it less receptive to learning how to write? __EOS__ Maybe. I think on the other hand, though, that a lot of adults who are concerned about their handwriting would be surprised at how really easy it is to improve it. You know, I really improved mine 100 percent. I came across a very, very beautiful handwriting style that's called italic that is taught in some schools. It's taught also to a lot of homeschoolers - it's quite popular with homeschoolers. __EOS__ Kitty Burns Florey is the author of ""Script and Scribble  The Rise and Fall of Handwriting."" She joined us from member station WNPR in Hartford, Connecticut. Thank you very much. __EOS__ Thank you. ",0
52663," Big toe, yeah.__EOS__ I guess, you know, he has reasons to be reclusive. But what gets him out in public is a funeral, the funeral of somebody who had been a close friend in childhood, and he's asked to give a eulogy. And even though he's a writer, he finds the idea of a eulogy terrifying. Why does he find it so terrifying?__EOS__ Well, it's that - you know, it's like also a toast or a graduation speech, any of those things where you're trying to really speak from the heart and do it in a way that's not sentimental, but still sincere. I think those are kind of terrifying moments. So a eulogy is - and also, this is from someone who's really not been in public for a long time.__EOS__ He actually finds a eulogy website.

52664," Well, I reveal every possible moment of my mustache life in this book, even panic when I don't have it on right. But it's very simple. It's just, it's there. It's there for real. I shave it with a Bic razor or whatever kind of razor from the top every day. Use cuticle nail cuticles to cut it on the bottom. And then if it's a little gray or you miss a place you just sketch it in with Maybelline Velvet Black, which is my favorite. And I tried the expensive kind, the smear-proof kind, the waterproof kind, but they just don't do it like Maybelline. And it has to be sharpened every time. And those little sharpeners break all the time, but I keep buying them, and I have them in every place I live, in my car. It's always like - it's kryptonite. Is kryptonite what Superman made him not powerful? __EOS__ It makes him weak - kryptonite. __EOS__ Oh, it makes him weak? No, this is opposite. This is spinach for Popeye. It gives me power to have my mustache on right and I'm clicked in mentally. But, you know, I don't even think I have a mustache. I mean to be honest, I never think about it. If I shaved it off right now I think there would be a scar there, like white, where 'cause no sun has ever hit there. I don't even believe - I say I don't like mustaches. I don't even think I have one. I've had it so long. I'm 19. I'm 64. So that's the longest-running mustache. And it's never changed, either. __EOS__ Why do you think you need it? ",0
52665," How do people get these chimps and monkeys? Are there - do you go online and get ads which seduce you and say, oh, you know, you'll never have more fun than you will with these cute little guys? __EOS__ Yeah, it's not even that much of a seduction, because there's enough of a marketplace, but you can go online and search tiger for sale, lion for sale, monkey for sale. You can also look through a newspaper that is oriented toward those who seek exotic pets. You can go to a state like Missouri, where although the laws are changing, it's basically unrestricted - the ownership of animals of any kind and you can go to a place as I did, like the Lolli Brothers' exotic auction in Macon, Georgia and spend a couple of days. __EOS__ So you can go and bid on a camel and if you're the winner, just ride it right off the lot? __EOS__ If you know how to ride your camel, I guess, and if you're -there's some place you want to go. But, yes, the yard is full of trailers and camels were big the day that I was there. One after another, these amazing animals that are captive bred here in this country and are put up for sale by the breeders to those who would like to have a camel instead of a kitty or a doggie. ",0
52666," Yes, I would have to say it was a high point of my life.__EOS__ What was the song, ""Add It Up""?__EOS__ Yeah, what was the song, quickly?__EOS__ The song was ""Gone, Daddy, Gone.""",0
52667," How much did you know about the women of Dagenham, the women who worked as machinists, sitting at those sewing machines hour after hour? __EOS__ Yeah, well, I'm ashamed to say that I didn't know about their plight or their fight. And not a lot of people of my generation and of younger generations, they don't really know. Without these women, there would have been no Equal Pay Act of 1970, actually then having a ripple effect across the world, and America became involved, the Ford plant in America. __EOS__ And it all started with these women who would ride their bicycles to work with those little wicker baskets in front. Did you spend much time with them? How much time did you spend, and what did you learn from them? __EOS__ I did. Well, I wanted to meet some of them if it was possible. I met three of the women. They were very lovely and very generous with their time. We had a cup of tea in Dagenham and  where they all still live. They're all still friends. What I got from them was their friendship. That's the glue that holds them together and their strength in numbers. ",1
52668," Especially for a guy who'd never before made a feature film. It all started 10 years ago when Benson showed his girlfriend a script of what was essentially the guy's side of ""The Disappearance Of Eleanor Rigby."" That was the story he wanted to tell. But his girlfriend had some questions.__EOS__ Where does she disappear to? And who is she? And can you answer some of those questions for me?__EOS__ He could. He did. He got excited.__EOS__ Well, maybe I should just write the whole other side of it. And then she sort of looked at me, she's like, yeah. And then I did.",1

52670," Blitz the Ambassador is a rapper and a teacher. He grew up in Ghana, moved to Ohio for college and now teaches songwriting at schools in New York City. __EOS__ Samuel Bazawule turned 10 in 1992. He was living in Accra, the capital of Ghana, and there was only one thing he wanted  tapes of rap music from the U.S. __EOS__ It was hip-hop. You didn't even have to ask. You know, that was it. It was like almost cultish, you know? So when people were traveling, they knew not to get anything but hip-hop. __EOS__ Groups like A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul and the Jungle Brothers were beloved in Accra for talking about Africa in their rhymes - and dressing the part. ",2
52671," Yeah, I mean because France was occupied by the Nazis, there were collaborators in France, which is not something that happened in England. England was never occupied. England just fought against the Germans. So have you found yourself, during your life in France, sometimes wondering who was a collaborator and who wasn't, who resisted and who turned in Jews?__EOS__ Oh yes, certainly, and I think that's something which is - it's something that people say, you know, hmm, what were you doing during the war. It's still very much present, this idea of - and there's an expression that even kids will use if somebody, you know, is a goody-two-shoes in school or sucks up to the teacher or whatever. You know, they'll be called a collabo and...__EOS__ For collaborator.__EOS__ Yeah, so it's definitely remained in sort of the - in the air, you know, this idea of people who collaborated or didn't collaborate. And of course, now the people who are still alive and could be accused of that or have been accused of that are beginning to die.",1

52673," At times, it did. Here's another one. Maybe, we're in a key point in the game and my catcher would legitimately come out and say hey, what do you want to do here? And I'd be like - I'd be in between thoughts. I'd be thinking about, well, maybe this pitch or that pitch. That's what I was thinking about, and I'd say to the catcher, what do you think? And he'd say, well, maybe a change-up here. At that point, the umpire would be walking out to the mound. And he'd say, OK, boys, let's go. Let's get back at this. And I'd make sure he was close enough, and I'd say, let's go with the change-up. And I'd say it loud enough that the umpire could hear it. Now, he would have time to think about it. And he'd be prepared for me throwing that change-up, and he, usually, knew where I was going to be throwing it. Now, he was prepared and looking in the area that I was throwing that pitch. Maybe, I get the benefit of the doubt and get the call because we're in a tight situation.__EOS__ We're speaking with Jamie Moyer. His memoir of his life in baseball is called ""Just Tell Me I Can't,"" and we'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with former major league pitcher Jamie Moyer. His memoir of his years in the big leagues is called ""Just Tell Me I Can't."" After a game, could you remember every pitch?__EOS__ There are some games, yeah, I could go back for a couple of days and pretty much tell you every pitch I threw. And then there are other games when, you know, maybe my focus and concentration wasn't there and I couldn't - you could take me off the field and talk about a pitch two innings previous and I wouldn't remember it.",3

52676," I don't know that I ever asked permission. My parents, we had - most of my life we had a little 12-inch black-and-white television set, and somewhere, sometime - I think I was in junior high school, my mom went to Macy's and bought a full-size color TV set, and she expected my dad to be angry when he got home, but he wasn't.__EOS__ That was it.__EOS__ You're so relaxed on your show, but it sounds like you're very obsessive about putting it together. Rolling Stone, the cover story about you in Rolling Stone, described you as transcribing the other late night hosts' monologues to make sure there's no similarities between your monologue and theirs. Can you talk a little bit more about why you or your staff transcribes those monologues, what you do with them?__EOS__ Yeah, it's not me personally. It's our staff - we have one poor guy who has to sit there and write all this stuff up every night. I just don't want to repeat jokes that have been on other shows. I don't want to be accused of stealing jokes from other shows. And I just kind of want to know what they're doing.",3

And he said, well, you talk rich. __EOS__ You talk rich. __EOS__ His association is, he associates a person who is well-spoken with wealth. I was wondering if you could comment on the connection between language and socioeconomic status, and also possibly the barriers that places for people who are trying to better their situation and move up in life. __EOS__ Something David Crystal writes a lot about in the book. But David, go ahead. ",0
52679,"  Tempest In a Flat Hat.""  He      says Keaton handcrafted every aspect of his movies in a way that would be      unimaginable today. __EOS__      Not only did he star in all these movies, but he directed them.  He wrote      them such as they were written, which really--they essentially came up      with a beginning and an ending and made up the middle as they went along.      But he also edited his own movies.  You know, no one really has that      kind of creative control these days. __EOS__  As you went back and researched all this, I mean, was there      something that struck you as a stunt or a scene that kind of has      resonated through the decades. __EOS__  Oh, gosh.  I mean, there are so many kind of iconic      moments. You know, he's known for these kind of quiet moments and he was      The Great Stone Face.  But he also had these huge blockbuster, big-screen      spectacles. And at the time, when he was shooting ""The General,"" he      actually had the most expensive scene in silent film history which cost      $42,000 back then.  And he actually wanted a locomotive to crash into a      river.  And so, that's exactly what they did.  They got a locomotive and      set a bridge on fire and crashed it into a river. ",0
52680," Oh, well, hi, thanks.__EOS__ Hi, Linda.__EOS__ I must say that I searched for words to try to describe your music, and I found that in things that have been written about you - folk, rootsy, Irish, bluegrass - can you tell me what you call it?__EOS__ Well, there are so many things that we can't call ourselves. We definitely can't call ourselves bluegrass because we're not American. We're not Irish, despite a lot of people's preconceptions. We already feel like we were born out of the tradition of folk so much, so really we just kind of call ourselves a rock band really.",2
52681," I mean who - they want then, we can see thousands boo their parents.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ That would be fun. But who wants to see thousands cheer your mom and dad? There's no fun in that.__EOS__ But you told me you try to keep up with, you know, what your kids are listening to and stay in touch with what matters to them, with the, you know, the new zeitgeist that's happening.",2
52682," Well, I think, for girls that may not have a family connection to Girl Scouts, I'm hoping that my story will resonate with them. I also think that, as we increase our outreach to, perhaps, parts of our country that may not have a strong programming because of the lack of volunteer resources or that there are girls, you know, that have moved into the area who are really interested in it, the more we're creative around new programming, that will interest them.__EOS__ Okay. Now, you know I have to put you on the spot. What's your favorite cookie?__EOS__ Oh, well, you know, again, as the CEO, I have lots of cookies. My son actually loves the Trefoil. I have a partial taste for Samoas, but we do have...__EOS__ A partial taste for Samoas?",3
52683," Thank you. __EOS__ Yet clearly, these events that people are writing about  Burning Man, and these concerts, and the protests, and various other things - they do not play the central role in our lives that these kinds of events played in the lives of people in prehistoric or even early historic times that you write about. What have we lost? __EOS__ We've lost a lot. In fact, I'm kind of surprised that so many callers have referenced their own participation in these kinds of things, which actually not that many people know about in our culture. You know, these are great but they're countercultural - a little bit, marginal. __EOS__ It's interesting you also conclude Dionysus was the first rock star. ",0

That's why we never have no beef.__EOS__ Yet can play all five minutes of it on a dance floor and have the entire dance floor sing every word of that song.__EOS__  ...For my fingernails. Chew to the...__EOS__ But what makes ""La Di Da Di"" more than just a really good rap song and why so many artists have borrowed from it in their own music is that it's full of these little, lyrical moments. And those moments, those samples will become the building blocks of hip-hop for years to come.",2
52685," Completely. And I think they made the right decision, obviously. But after they tried a bunch of scenes they had outlined, they really went, you know, fairly far in that direction, they just realized that this was not - this just wasn't current enough. It wasn't fresh enough and they dropped it. And they went on the hiatus from this idea and years passed before they came back to it and made the decision to reset it among Puerto Rican kids and Anglo kids on the Upper West Side.__EOS__ And interesting, you mentioned a few of the luminaries who were involved in the production, a young Stephen Sondheim brought in to write lyrics.__EOS__ That's right. Well, originally, Leonard Bernstein was going to write both the lyrics and also the music. Well, Leonard Bernstein, during this period, and I should say there's about nine years there from the beginning of this idea until the fruition, he was a little busy. He was conductor for the New York Philharmonic. He was doing television shows. He was writing the music for ""Candide,"" a very ambitious musical. And he was kind of a superman. But at a certain point, he had to say, wait a minute. I can't handle it all.__EOS__ And the resetting finally opens on Broadway. Of course, like every Broadway musical, it's got its funding problems and the stories of what went wrong during rehearsals and everything else. But it took the critics by storm when it opened in 1957.",1
52686," Does that story, in a way, combine the two conflicting stories of Mark and Luke because you have, like, the mortal Jesus being crucified, but that's just his shell? But the more - but the spirit of Jesus is kind of laughing at the Romans, who don't realize that they're just killing the shell and not the soul and not the spirit. __EOS__ one who's suffering, and one who can also say forgive them, Father, they don't know what they're doing. __EOS__ Yeah - no, that's a really interesting way to look at it because ""The Coptic Apocalypse of Peter"" was written after these other Gospels, and he may well have known them. And in a sense, you could say that it is even more influenced by something like the Gospel of John, because in John's Gospel -John is the only Gospel where Jesus is explicitly identified as himself being a divine being, being himself God. __EOS__ Bart Ehrman, speaking to Terry Gross in 2009. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR. ",0
52687,"  His father is a famous op ed writer, and his mother works in the publishing industry.  So Nathaniel Rich was always destined for a literary life.  His parents weren't surprised when he started writing film criticism. __EOS__  A lot of other writers, when they tell their parents what they want to do for a living are often greeted with sort of looks of  consternation or anger, so I got a little bit of that, but they couldn't really take it too far because they'd set the bad example to begin with.   __EOS__  First novels by young men often feature a young man of the protagonist, for example Eugene in Nathaniel Rich's novel, ""The Mayor's Tonque.""  Eugene is hired to research his favorite writer, Constance Econs .  Rich interweaves Eugene's story with a story of two old men, Mr. Schmitz  and Mr. Rutherford . __EOS__  And I realized at a certain point, I could not escape certain basic things, like one of the protagonists being a young man in New York, or at least starting there.  But it was important to me to have the story be much bigger than that.  And Mr. Schmitz and Rutherford strand is very much a part of that. ",0

You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. __EOS__ No. You know, regarding the standards, I just think it's okay. I mean, the Western standards issue, really takes care of . I also wanted to comment that, you know, it's - from the very beginning, when I started the research, I thought - I was completely convinced that it's exploitation of women. And, you know, when you're looking at it from abroad or from telephone conversation, it seems to be the worst thing a woman can go through. ",1

I listen to country and I listen to jazz and gospel too.__EOS__ I wonder, any chance for some for mixing genres in your career?__EOS__ Let it be. In the words of John and Paul  let it be. Absolutely.

52692," Yeah, we didn't. What's funny is that he was probably the coolest of all of us. Like we were like over-preparing and nervous and going over each syllable, and, you know, usually when we do that, it takes like four or five rehearsals to nail it and especially when you're bringing someone in that doesn't have that experience of it. It could be a risk.__EOS__ So what did it feel like for you to back up a president?__EOS__ It was a little surreal. It was a little surreal watching it. But I've got to tell you, Terry, I've learned long ago to curb my enthusiasm.__EOS__ And this is the one character trait in me that the people closest to me absolutely abhor, the fact that I've very nonchalant about everything. I'm not saying that it wasn't a big deal, but it's just that I've come to the realization that every day my life has this sort of Forrest Gump existence. Like every day is an I was there moment. So it just becomes, you know, a little redundant to get excited about every day when every day is sort of like a high.",0
52693," Yeah. __EOS__ And it kind of got totaled when they were towing it on one scene. __EOS__ Now - so, it isn't not a car that could ever be driven again, it's because it's only good for barbecue at this point? __EOS__ No, it was purely a barbecue car. And it's stuck around in their - the back of their acre for a while, but it's no longer with us. ",0

52695," Well, I would say that our design team - and I need to mention the others, because it's not just the Freelon Group but David Adjaye of Adjaye Associates in London, Davis Brody Bond of New York and the SmithGroup there in Washington. It was really a collaborative effort, and I think that the jury resonated with this notion of expressing both the difficult stories, telling the truth, but also the story that - of rejuvenation. And I think really the quintessential American story of being able to persevere against difficult circumstances and become successful in this country. __EOS__ You, yourself, are African-American and as you pointed out other members of your design group are people of African heritage. David Adjaye was born in Tanzania. Max Bond Group, J. Max Bond group, who sadly passed in the course of preparing for the competition, is considered one of the deans of architecture in this country and African-American architecture also. Do you think it was important to have African-American architects as leaders of this design process for this project? Do you think that matters? __EOS__ Well, we certainly did. And perhaps the jury felt the same way. And at the end of the day the design and the approach I think is what's important. And I think that different architects, different backgrounds can certainly bring value to the process. Having said that, I do believe that being part of the culture, we are in a better position, as African-Americans, to help interpret that through architecture and through design. __EOS__ Do you think there is an African-American aesthetic? ",3
52696," Ever since the middle of the 20th century, the relationship between orchestra audiences and new music has been variable. In some cases negative. Younger audiences are much more eager and accepting of new music than our established audiences are, and since we do rely on our established audiences, there's often a sense that new music doesn't have a place on our programming. But it has a very important place in our programming. __EOS__ Dalbavie's music has been labeled accessible. He says that's not his goal. But he does think that earlier contemporary composers had made it difficult for audiences and even musicians to understand their work. __EOS__ We had to analyze the score to really understand. And I thought it was a problem with music because with music you must really touch the perception, you must really touch the ears. __EOS__ Dalbavie insists he doesn't write for an audience. He says he composes for himself, to create something new. Of course he hopes audiences like his music. But he says they can interpret it anyway they want. ",2
52697," Yeah.__EOS__ ...Of all...__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ ...Is something that my mother taught me, and that's the English roast potatoes.",0
52698," Let me talk to you a little bit about something that I know is right up your alley, and that's the bones of Richard III. Have you been following that, you know, they found under a parking lot?__EOS__ Yeah. I know. I think everybody has been following that. That's so much fun. I wish I could have gotten my hands on those bones. And it certainly looks like him. I mean, he was known to have some orthopedic issues, and these bones certainly exhibit orthopedic issues. And I attended some of the scientific presentations on that, at the American Academy of Forensic Sciences a couple of weeks ago.__EOS__ King Richard died in 1485.

A yeshiva is a Jewish school...__EOS__ It was a yeshiva for boys and girls.__EOS__ For boys and girls.",1
52700," Yeah, right.__EOS__ You know, she comes to this sort of material, Shakespeare's text, with such extraordinary profound sensitivity and alertness to the truth of any one word. And every take was different, and it was always an exploration. And that's what I love about her performance, you know? It's ungilded. It comes from someplace of extraordinary truth in her.__EOS__ You have played some of the most critically acclaimed villains in recent years, obviously, Amon Goth from ""Schindler's List,"" Lord Voldemort and Coriolanus, I would add to that. Do you see those kinds of roles as your strength as an actor?__EOS__ What, villain roles?",1
52701," They had - no. But you see, the thing about zombie movies is that they always degenerate into - at least one scene or another where somebody with a high-powered rifle starts kind of randomly killing them from, you know, like a high point on a building and everybody does this for fun. And so, they always become, ultimately, a kind of comedy. __EOS__ ...their strange reaction to mirrors, the sleeping in coffins and all that stuff. I wanted to include all those details. __EOS__ Okay. __EOS__ And Jenny, it sounds like your dog is hungry for brains. ",0
52702," Oh, yeah. And to have to work with such an outsized personality, ego and say, hey, whatever it takes, its there and you got to, you know, and you got a go for it and sometimes it doesn't work and a lot of times it does. And so you just keep on pushing, you know. __EOS__ So let's hear ""Beast of Burden"" and this is from the Stones' 19... __EOS__ Please do. I love that one. __EOS__ Me too. The 1978 album ""Some Girls,"" ""Beast of Burden."" ",2
52703," So he goes out, and then of course the story unfolds. __EOS__ He meets up with Lefty Mouse, and then also Reverend Tom Toad. __EOS__ Right. He's on the run from the Ku Klux Klan in the South. And so then you have three characters moving, which I thought was very good. Because each one has special qualities. Three is a good number for traveling partners. __EOS__  Now my ladies has gone  workers walked down last wintertime  good kitty was a dear sweetheart of mine. She walked around all winter on the picket line, but I found her when the snow was on the ground. ",2
52704," Thanks. __EOS__ Yeah, sure. Yeah. There is discrimination based on the color of the skin. I mean, I think that African-Americans are something that is more strange for Vietnamese. They've seen less of that. And they do discriminate more against children who are of African-American descent than the Caucasian ones. And there was a lot more concern during the Babylift for those kids, that those African-American, Amerasian kids would be taken out of the country because of that. And I think when they go back, they feel it too. It's just - it's very strange to Vietnamese. And so, I think that - I think a lot of those children have suffered. __EOS__ Let's go next to Tricia. Tricia with us from Nashville. __EOS__ Hi. How are you today? ",0
52705," Yeah, I'm sure it wasn't. We'll talk about that one a little bit later. __EOS__ OK. __EOS__ One of your most dangerous stunts was for a western, ""Little Big Man,"" about Custer's last stand. __EOS__ Right. ",1
52706," So thinking about how gruesome that is...__EOS__ Mm-hmm__EOS__ Thinking about what a terrifying character this man really was, how did it - just like how did it physically feel to know that you had been a friend of his - and you'd been, you know, alone and didn't room with? I mean I don't know if you're thinking maybe he could've killed you.__EOS__ You know, it happened gradually that I started to realize I had been in danger. My mind protected me at first from that thought. But what it felt like to realize that I had been in the presence of, you know, a kind of almost Dahmer, Jeffrey Dahmer-like character, was to suddenly realize that we're all in danger a lot of the time. I sort of got post traumatic stress or some version of it immediately. You know, people on the street dressed as policemen, we assume our policemen and bankers in the bank, we assume our bankers, not criminals posing as them.

52708," There's a price to pay. I'm willing to pay it. I would much rather encourage people to develop healthy families, relationships, enjoy the beach. And yes, can I do all that, too? Yes. But I think that I've come out reasonably well. But if you haven't figured it out by now, there are those of my friends who might even say I'm a little eccentric. __EOS__ You know, eccentricity doesn't seem such a terrible price. What is the price you think you pay for doing this well? __EOS__ Loss of innocence. The  you say, if I do my job well, there's going to be somebody in this society who maybe I can protect, that doesn't have to learn all the evils that there are. They can go ahead, and they can live their life, and they can go to the theater, and they can go to the art, and they can live the quality of life that I think that all of us would like. __EOS__ Well, Richard Walter, Michael Capuzzo, thanks so much for speaking with us. ",0
52709," I'm glad to be here. __EOS__ …to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Going through, you've written magazine articles, stuff about that, and now the book is out. And - and the message seems to be that some big health issues - obesity, smoking - can be spread just like a disease. Is that right? __EOS__ That's absolutely correct. And it's - it's actually bigger than that. It's bigger than being big. It's really about how everything that we do is influenced by our social networks. And so we have research that's come out over the last few years that shows that if your friend's friend's friend becomes obese, it increases the likelihood that you will be obese as well. And this can be a person that you don't know and have never met before. And so we get these chain reactions going from one person to another through close friendships where one person can be affected by other people. But we find this not just for obesity. __EOS__ Hmm. And Nicholas, why is that? Have you figured out why that is or you just know that it is? ",0
52710," My pleasure.__EOS__ You are a former bass player for The Frames, an Irish band, right?__EOS__ Correct.__EOS__ So how much of this is drawn from your own time in music?",1
52711," Well, you know, and that's something I carry with me. And I lean on that. I dream about him every now and then. I've dreamed about him three times since he passed away. And one of the dreams, he came walking down a road. And it was, like, a dirt road. And he looked so beautiful. He looked like he did, like, in about 1973. He was - I mean, clean as a whistle. He looked rested, and he had a tan. And he - we stopped, and he sat down. He said, Stuart, how are you doing? I said, good, J.R. How're you doing? He says, you wouldn't believe what I've learned to do since I've been up here. I said, show me; tell me. He said, I can sing just like Merle Haggard.__EOS__ And so he started imitating Merle Haggard and got up, and we hugged each other. And he walked off. And I saw Merle right after that. I said, Hag, you've got to hear this. You have to hear this. And I told him what I had dreamed. And he said, was it in color? I said, absolutely. He said, those are the best kind. .__EOS__ Does it feel like a visitation when you have a dream like that?__EOS__ Absolutely. It was a wonderful visit.",2
52712," That's true, because I know ever since I started to make it in the business, I'd always thought if I do make or when I make it, I want to do something great back home to honor my father and mother, and, you know, have the, you know, the family be proud of me up there and all the folks in that area.__EOS__ Here's an email we have from Gwynneth  Well, I was working towards becoming an astronomer when I went blind. Nothing like shift happening. So now I'm a blind mom back in college learning everything I can get my hands on and loving every minute of it. So fate can intervene in your dreams, as well.__EOS__ Revised dreams, when the bank took my house and everything I own back in 2008, after spending a number of months crying, I thought well, now that I don't have a mortgage, furniture or a place to live and none of the responsibility that comes with those things anymore, I'm free to do something new. So I thought well, I've always wanted to leave the U.S. and live in South America.__EOS__ my German shepherd. Still here three and a half years later. Good job, found another foreigner for a boyfriend, learned the language, got my driver's license, about to buy a new truck and thinking about starting my own business. No, I'm not lucky. It's been real hard. But meeting the challenge with gusto makes me thrilled with living.",0
52713," Oh boy. Well, I can say this. I think going through it was just me going through it. I didn't really have any preconceived notion as to what it was going to be like. I did want to go in the footsteps of Salt 'N' Peppa, but that was just by way of hearing them and wanting to emulate them in some sort of fashion. But I didn't have any idea of what I was facing. I was just doing it. And I think second time around, you know, I'm able to see things much clearer, and, you know, it's sort of moving slow motion now. And I think back then I wasn't really in present time. I was just there going through the motions, and it sort of panned out nicely because of the people that I was surrounded with. And it made it a little bit easier. And I think being a woman in the game made it that much easier, because there's so many males. __EOS__ Really? __EOS__ Yeah, it's a male-dominated field. And I think to be able to stand out, you've got to either look a different way or present some other type of fashion, which we've seen done many times over. Or you have to be saying something that's different from what, you know, what's being said. And I think at the time when I first came out, they thought I was a little boy. You know, every time they would meet me for the first time, oh my God, you're MC Lyte? I thought you were a 12-year-old boy or something like that. __EOS__ And I was like no, not so. So I think it actually worked for me at that time. ",2
52714," Or just 'cause I was born in Brooklyn.__EOS__  Yeah, that, too.__EOS__ Yeah, that, too. Nicholas Dawidoff is the author of  ""Collision Low Crossers  A Year Inside the Turbulent World of NFL Football.""

52716," You talk about the current situation in Iraq and the growth of ISIS. And you look at that country today, there are atrocities. There's violence. There's chaos. Can you argue today that that country is a safer place and a better place than it was when Saddam Hussein was in power?__EOS__ For the security of the United States, yes. I would argue with you that had the United States once again turned a blind eye to the threat that Saddam Hussein posed - I say once again, there were 17 resolutions by the world demanding, you know, accountability - that one could envision a nuclear arms race between Iran and Iraq. The man, Saddam Hussein, would have a lot of revenues, a result of high prices of oil. And even though there wasn't, you know, a - we found a dirty bomb, for example, he had the capacity to make chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. And so there's, you know - that's all very hypothetical. But, yeah, I could argue that we're much safer without Saddam. And I would argue that the people of Iraq have a better shot at living in a peaceful state.__EOS__ You argue that the United States is safer even though we hear all these very ominous warnings about ISIS, you know...__EOS__ Yeah.",0
52717," So the frontal lobes are often thought as the engine of socialization because this is what you build up as you mature, as you grow up. You know, a child will steal a candy bar off the shelf or urinate in public or say something inappropriate. And what parents do through reward and punishment is they give feedback, letting them know that's not socially appropriate. And this is how you build up your frontal lobes, which essentially squelch that impulsive behavior. Well, what happens with these frontal-temporal dementia patients is that that frontal lobe is now gone and they are dis-inhibited. So now they'll steal things off the shelf. They'll urinate in public. They'll touch people inappropriately. They'll take their clothes off. They'll do all of these things that are legally inappropriate. And because their frontal lobes are damaged there's no amount of punishment that is going to somehow fix that. And so what happens, this happens increasingly in courtrooms around the nation where their embarrassed adult children or their lawyers will have to stand in front of the judge and explain that it's not exactly their fault, it's something going on in their brain.__EOS__ My guest is neuroscientist David Eagleman, author of the book ""Incognito  The Secret Lives of the Brain.""__EOS__ My guest is neuroscientist David Eagleman, author of ""Incognito  The Secret Lives of the Brain."" He directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action at Baylor the College of Medicine.__EOS__ Well, it is the case - it is the case that we're always looking for patterns. And this is what humans are really good at and most of the time this serves us quite well. And this is essentially how science proceeds, it's the fuel of science. We observe many things and we make hypotheses about what might be the model behind it. The fact is that coming up with the idea of a God or a creator is a perfectly good model, it's a perfectly good hypothesis for what might be going on. And then the idea is we use the tools of science in as much as we can, to weigh in and gather evidence for or against that hypothesis against all the other possible stories.",0
52718," OK.__EOS__ Tom, that hyperpiano sounds like it's medicated, not that hyper.__EOS__ But just wait. In a moment, we'll hear it in a full cry mode, so to speak, Guy.__EOS__ All right.",2
52719," Yeah. __EOS__ And you tell a story about - I'm trying to remember the details, but somebody who would come to you who was like a finance minister for an Asian country? __EOS__ He would come to town like every six months. He had the diplomatic passport. I looked him up online. He said who he was and he would get broke. Come to the pawn shop, pawn a lot of gold. Gamble some more. Come back, pawn a lot of gold. This would be over a weekend. And on Monday or Tuesday he would get a bank wire in and pick everything up. __EOS__ And what kind of gold? Are we talking about coins, bars, what? ",3
52720," It didn't surprise me. I do have a rather large nose. __EOS__ So she told you that when you found yourself, you'd be beautiful. But when you found yourself, you became a feminist, you were running a collective restaurant in Berkeley. Was that her idea of how you should find yourself? Did she object to the things that were actually enabling you to feel good about yourself and to live the life that led to the life you live now, as one of the best-known food writers and editors in America? __EOS__ You know, she totally objected. She was horrified by what she had wrought. I mean I did everything that she had sort of given me permission not to do. I got married really young and she, you know, kept saying, why are you getting married? You don't have to get married. And then I went off and lived this alternative life and, you know, I was running a restaurant. She said, is this what we sent you to graduate school for? I mean, she was horrified. And then I think also something that I think many mothers struggle with, with their daughters, I think she was a little jealous that I had a kind of freedom she had never had. And that... __EOS__ Did you feel that, that she was jealous? ",0
52721," And that is only after their initial tactics failed. These were improvisations.__EOS__ Yeah. I think in the days leading up to the confrontation, one of the things you see as a reluctance on the part of the police organization for people higher up in the organization to participate in the planning because, you know, there will be possible deniability. So then, as things go bad, it becomes more and more haphazard and truly spirals out of control.__EOS__ There are miscalculations on the other side too. This is a group that had its intentions, but one of the things it was doing was deliberately provoking the people in that neighborhood so to force the police department to make a decision.__EOS__ Yeah. I think that's accurate, and it's difficult to know at the end of the day how far they wanted to take things. I think that there's a certain point of view that says, in fact, they wanted to provoke the action of the police and show the true nature of the system as they came over the top. Did they expect them to come over the top just that violently? Did they intend to die in the house? I don't know the answer to that. It's not impossible that, in fact, they did.",1
52722," But no lyrics really. Just a suggestion of a sound. __EOS__ The voice as an instrument, an abstract instrument. __EOS__ Morricone was born in 1928. He wasn't a child prodigy but he was precocious. At a very young age, he was zipping right through the music school. He was very active in the Italian contemporary music scene, a trumpet player. Did a lot of work with vocal groups, which I think explains a lot of the vocal music that shows up in a lot of his music. And he made his living arranging pop songs, and I think you could hear that juxtaposition of styles in that last cue. __EOS__ I have read interviews with sympathetic audiences and they've just struggled to figure out what is this guy saying. But he can apply these and make them work in a film score context. I want to go to an example of really Morricone as a contemporary composer. ",2
52723," Right, and then what you would do then is effectively you cut the botnet's head off. It no longer can communicate with its controller. So what Conficker did was it generated initially 250 different Web addresses every day, and so every day, it would send that little message - hi, I'm here, tell me what to do - to all 250 of those randomly generated Web addresses. __EOS__ So what the people fighting Conficker did was tried to come up with an algorithm that would also generate as many domain addresses as the Conficker people were generating. And what was the point of that? __EOS__ Well, what they did was, they were able to turn the clock forward on the Conficker worm. So they knew in advance which 250 websites it was going to try to contact the next day, next week. And given any day in the future they could set the clock forward, and they would know, OK, you know, a month from today, these are the 250 Web addresses that that worm is going to generate. So it's going to try to knock on those particular 250 doors. __EOS__ So they could shut those doors. ",0
52724," That's Linda Ronstadt from her first album of standards, which was called ""What's New,"" and the first of three albums in which she collaborated with the arranger Nelson Riddle.__EOS__ Well, I learned a tremendous amount. I mean I told Nelson in the beginning, I had the chutzpah to tell him I needed a really custom fit and that I liked to be involved in the way the arrangements were set. I didn't kid my, you know, I can do simple arrangements myself. I've done some very simple string writing and some very simple - and I can do pretty complicated harmony arrangements. But I knew that I was way over my head with anything like this. And he was one of the great masters of the style, if not the great master for pop music.__EOS__ He - Nelson Riddle died while doing the arrangements for your third album together. That must've been devastating.__EOS__ It was devastating because there was only one Nelson Riddle. They don't make any more like him. And, you know, it was the end of an era in a certain way. And we still had one track to record after he died and we did. Musicians were crying in the orchestra because they all loved Nelson. You know, he'd given them so much work over the years and he appreciated what, you know, what their abilities were.",3
52725," Well, it's ready now. It's used in Europe. The Army is doing FDA testing to get their approval to go ahead and use it. So it's a proven technology. It would help save a lot of lives. They're ready to go with it just, as I say, waiting for FDA approval. __EOS__ It's really remarkable. Now another soldier who had his face blown off is now doing some standup comedy. How did he get from, basically having no face, to going before an audience and doing standup? __EOS__ Well, you're referring to Bobby Henline, who was a sergeant in the 82nd Airborne, who was blown up in Iraq in a Humvee in which there were five paratroopers riding. He was the only one to survive. And when he started to recover, he told me look, I'm not a terrifically religious guy. I, you know, I don't believe in all this stuff, but you can't go through an experience like that, being the only one out of five people who survived without thinking why did I survive? __EOS__ What of my supposed to do, because those four guys, my buddies, are watching, saying you better do something with this opportunity. And he said it was so clear to me, God wanted me to do something but he didn't tell me what it was. And it was several years before Bobby was convinced to try to take his humor public. ",3
52726," Can I... __EOS__ Yeah, go ahead. __EOS__ There are 56 million disabled people in America. Stop and think about that figure. That's like one out of, what, six or seven or something like that? But you never see them. I mean they've done studies - the Screen Actors Guild did a study a couple of years ago where they found that .05 of all talking - speaking parts in film and television was a disabled actor, or a disabled character. Not just an actor, a disabled character. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. ",0
52727," Right.__EOS__ He doesn't suffer fools. But no, nobody - he did not get hurt, but we had to be very careful that he didn't. And by the way, like the eye pokes, for instance, we did have them working with stunt men who were showing them that you do the eye poke actually over the - just over the eyebrows. And it happens so fast that it does look like the eyes.__EOS__ So that little disclaimer at the end, that's not really you guys?__EOS__ No.",1
52728,"  Urban films, yeah.  You know what?  I'm always searching      for crossover roles.  You know, I mean, there have been roles      that--because this is what happened.  Sometimes when the studio decides      to make a movie, most of the studio films are not written for black      people, you know.  Even the roles that Will Smith takes, you know, they      offered the script to Tom Cruise and Will Smith.  You know, it's not like      they offered the role to Will Smith, then Jamie, then L.L.  It doesn't      really work like that.  There have been times when the studios say, `OK,      you know, we may open this role up to an ethnic character, even though      the role is still written white,' and I have, you know, pursued those      opportunities, but very rarely do they keep the role ethnic. __EOS__  But as urban films go, if we're going to keep that, again, title      going, when I think of your career, I think of, you know, the seminal      ""Boyz n the Hood,"" but another movie... __EOS__  Yes. __EOS__  ...that really is so endearing to the African-Americans      community, ""The Best Man,"" was another one of your films. ",3
52729," And why is he one of your favorites?__EOS__ Just his voice is so silky smooth and beautiful and everything that I think of when I think of Portuguese and Brazilian music; he personifies that, and it's a beautiful sound.__EOS__ Jherek Bischoff will be back in the second half of the show. His new album is called ""Composed."" Here's the track with singer Caetano Veloso. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.__EOS__  Torn from the mountainside and the mine, we melt in the pit.

Most importantly, he's sober five years and - which is a miracle. I mean, he nearly died so, so many times. God - he's married, he has a great circle of friends. So, you know, it was unimaginable for a while ago, I mean, I didn't think he was going to make it to 21. But last summer, he turned 30.",0
52731," But the truth is bluegrass is a music that really came together around Bill Monroe and Flat and Scruggs, and some other great musicians around the Grand Ole Opry at a time when you stood and play in front of the mics. And it was built around a folk kind of music that really didn't have piano in it.  __EOS__ It's a good blend. __EOS__ Chick Corea, let me ask you. There are so many diverse interests in your background, from Latin obviously, jazz, classical music of various types. Was there any exposure to bluegrass when we were growing up? __EOS__ Only through Bela, actually. Through the years that I've known him and we began to - I began to listen to the Flecktones and his music. And actually it wasn't so much the banjo that interested me as the music he was playing. But then through him, then I thought, especially on this project, actually, what happened is Bela brought this song that we played earlier on the show called ""Mountain.""  ",2
52732,"  No, it is not. How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight? I don't want to die without any scars. So come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.__EOS__  God. This is crazy. I...__EOS__  So go crazy. Let 'er rip.__EOS__  I don't know about this.",1
52733,"  I suspect now that you look back on your career, that must have      been the highlight for you. __EOS__  It was.  It was.  It was.  And a training ground like no      other. I worked on that show for 11 months with Pearl, and in that 11      months, what I watched every show was a total professional, hundred and      ten percent every time out. __EOS__  Is that something that you will continue to do throughout your      career... __EOS__  No, I don't think so.  I... ",3
52734," Where were you that morning? __EOS__ I was in my church. I went to the St. Paul Lutheran Church, and my wife and my daughter were at Sixteenth Street. It was an overcast day. That I'll never forget. Today happens to be an overcast day down here, too. __EOS__ What did you see when you first arrived at the church? At the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church? __EOS__ I never did get there. I never did get there. A block away from the church, I saw my wife's cousin, and she told me, come on, go with me. We can't find Denise. And so I moved her over from under the steering wheel, and we drove over to a hospital, and we fumbled around, and we found somebody else who had been in the morgue. And there lay all four of them, there side by side on the table. And Denise was lying out there with a piece of mortar, it looked like a rock, mashed in her head. ",3
52735," Yeah. And then maybe you can also say that there are a lot of stupid guys so you have to take care. That's very simple to say. But I understood that she was making a big decision about happiness. Whatever happens with Rodolfo, I'm going to choose this path because it's what I want to do. And that is the biggest idea of Gloria's way of thinking. She's choosing life even though life is asking for a price.__EOS__ There is a lovely scene at the end where we witness Gloria's rebirth, essentially. She's at a friend's wedding and this song that becomes her anthem of sorts comes on. Everyone is dancing and she has this amazing dance scene. Can you describe how that was filmed, because you have some great moves, Paulina, in that scene?__EOS__ We began the scene at 1 o'clock, morning, and we finished at 5 30, morning.__EOS__ Oh, my.",1
52736," Yeah. __EOS__ ...this is self-promotion... __EOS__ That's good. That's why we're all here. __EOS__ ...is that - and actually, this is a Columbia theme. This is not unique with me. Lee Bollinger, our president, really enunciated this a long time ago, that science is part of culture. It's - you're a perfect example of this, Ira. There's no reason why the most arcane subject in science can't be explained so all of us can understand it. And I think it's very important to communicate science to other people. And the film does this, in very modest way. ",1
52737," We were a slave economy longer than we've been anything else, but yet, black people don't want to hear about it. They feel shame or anger. White people don't want to hear about it. They say, we didn't have any money, we didn't know anything. I don't even know these - you know, who the plantation people were. And all the new arrivals in the past 50 years are, like, you know, I don't even know what you'll are talking about.__EOS__ We're speaking with Emmy-winning, Oscar-nominated actress Alfre Woodard.

But I think children are ready to see this at 11.__EOS__ Really?",1
52738," Well, I think they were delighted that someone wanted to record their music.__EOS__ Let's play a recording and then you can tell us more about it. Here it is.__EOS__ This is called ""Mesi Papa Vensan,"" which means thank you father Vincent. And it's for the president, the first president of Haiti following American invasion. And this was a jazz band playing at an elite club on Christmas Eve.__EOS__ I was going to say, it sounds like a jazz that Americans would have heard.",2
52739," You eventually made your way down to Florida, which of course, has a climate that's closer to Kenya than Rhode Island's, and that's where you make your home today. How did you start out making music in Florida?__EOS__ My brother Phillip was also very instrumental in my music journey in Kenya with the a cappella group .__EOS__ That's the way you started your career, as an a cappella...__EOS__ Yes.",2
52740," How did you react when you heard that the National Symphony Orchestra wanted to pay tribute to you, along with John Philip Sousa and Duke Ellington?__EOS__ I jumped straight up. I jumped straight up and down. It was the most unbelievable feeling, you know, when I heard it, and I really appreciate it. I really do. I never dreamed anything like that.__EOS__ Steven Reineke, how about you? In fact, I should mention that you're beginning your tenure as NSO's Principle Pops Conductor.__EOS__ The concert was well in the works before I got involved in it, so here's what happened, is the management and the artistic staff at the Kennedy Center and the National Symphony came to me and said, we want you to do the Labor Day concert and here is the premise. We're going to feature these three artists. And they told me - Sousa, Ellington and Chuck Brown - and I thought, well, okay, that's - how do you put together a concert featuring all of that?",2
52741," Good, thanks. Go ahead.__EOS__ Well, myself, I find sometimes dreams just come back after a very extended period of time. When I was a kid, I was pretty into science. You know, I was one of those kind of nerdy kids, idolized Albert Einstein. Unfortunately, I was also blessed with ADD and wound up out of school by middle school. And by my 20s, my main ambition was to be in the Cirque du Soleil. I was making a living off of street performance, doing a lot of traveling, until I blew a knee out during a New Year's Eve performance and wound up having to reevaluate that dream.__EOS__ I can understand that. So what did you decide to do?__EOS__ Well, you fast-forward about 10 years, and I'm just wrapped up as a green environmental engineer and going out to San Francisco to present my research next week. So sometimes one dream getting killed just makes you wait for another dream to come back and get a second chance.",0
52742," No, I actually find that I distance - having that distance is very good for me. I like being at home from the outside. One has to let go of easy, sentimentalist things and just be very clear-eyed about looking at home. __EOS__ Do you - when you do go back to Lagos, and you go back a few times a year, is that right? __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ Do you carry around a notebook with you to jot down observations or details? Because the book is filled with so many details, both from Nigeria and from your experiences in the U.S. ",0
52743," Yes. There is a scene in our book where in between throwing pieces of furniture off of a Mediterranean hotel window into the sea below, these kids are literally burning euros to light cigars.__EOS__ You know, well, people may have noticed that we're talking about this in the past tense. This was a limited era, the online poker playing era. What happened?__EOS__ It lasted almost exactly 10 years. The United States government cracked down originally in 2008 with a set of laws that were tacked on to a Homeland Security bill that essentially outlawed online poker. And by the year 2010, online poker was effectively shut down in the United States and these kids were all forced to find something else to do with their time.__EOS__ So where did these kids that we follow in this book, where'd they go?",0

We hear he is a whiz of a wiz if ever a wiz there was. If ever...__EOS__ It's safe to say that most Americans are familiar with the classic film and the image of the stumbling scarecrow, the rusted tin man, the cowardly lion and Dorothy, played by the actress Judy Garland clad in gingham and braids.  Over the years, ""The Wizard of Oz"" has been a popular and profitable franchise, producing toys, Halloween costumes, ruby slipper replicas and several spinoffs, including a film called ""The Wiz.""__EOS__   Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road. Come on ease on down, ease on down the road. Don't you carry nothing that might be a load. Come on ease on down, ease on down, down the road.",0
52746," So one day walk in a couple of guys. And they were Jerry Moss and Herb Alpert - A&M. And they introduced themselves. And they heard a couple of songs. And they said to me - said I really like your sound. I'd like to sign you with our record company. And I said wow, really? You know, great. Here we go.__EOS__ We did the first record, you know, ""Herb Alpert Presents Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66."" The song ""Mas Que Nada"" went to the top of the charts. It was the first time that the song in Portuguese was a hit in America and all over the world.__EOS__ Then I brought my first car - a Pontiac LeMans. Remember that - 1966, gray.__EOS__ That's the song that gave me my first big break. And I still love playing it. I never got tired of it.",2
52747," Thank you. __EOS__ That's Frazey Ford, performing a track from her new solo album. It's called ""Obidiah."" And that song is called ""If You Gonna Go."" __EOS__ Stepping in to being a parent is the most life-altering change that I think anybody can go through. It changes your perspective completely. You are no longer about yourself; you're about guiding another human being. __EOS__ Frazey Ford, talk a little bit about your background. Your parents were Americans who went to Canada during the Vietnam War, right? ",2
52748," Trained as a classical musician, Ciani fell in love with synthesizers in the late 1960s and quickly found that commercials and movies offered the best opportunities.__EOS__ Three, two, one. Blast off. You will go to hyperspace. Your mission  save the human race. We are ...__EOS__ She just released a new album, ""Lixiviation,"" looking back on her decades in music. And Suzanne Ciani joins me now from the studios of KQED in San Francisco. Welcome. It's a real pleasure.__EOS__ It's my pleasure, Jacki. Thank you. I'm happy to be here.",2
52749," When we're in the shower, when we're thinking about our idea - boy, does it sound brilliant. But the reality is that most of our ideas are actually terrible.__EOS__ That's entrepreneur Eric Ries. He's some up with his fair share of good and bad ideas, and now he has some new ideas for how to start a business. One of them is that it's okay to put a totally unfinished product out into the market. Not only that, sometimes it's actually better than trying to get the product perfect first. Ries' new book is called ""The Lean Startup,"" and he joined us to talk more about it.__EOS__ When we start to think of all of our work as an experiment that is designed for learning, not just making more stuff, new and interesting possibilities come up. So, for example, I once spent six months building a product that customers wouldn't even download off the Internet, so it didn't really matter how buggy it was or what kind of problems it had. And what I realized is that if we had just created a single Web page to offer people a chance to download that product without having even built it, we wouldn't have even needed to build page two, where we apologize for the fact that it didn't exist yet, because nobody would even click that download button.__EOS__ So start small. That's another one of your suggestions, here.",3
52750," You know, that was really not my style. You know, I didn't have that kind of, you know, belligerence, you know, that kind of duck waddle to do it. And so the great thing about the Voice was they didn't pigeonhole you. They would let you write about theater if you saw something you wanted to write about and no one else was doing it, or if you wanted to write about a record. They didn't slot you.__EOS__ You write a lot about Pauline Kael in your memoir. And she was, of course, perhaps the best and the most influential film critic ever. What did she represent to you as a reader?__EOS__ As a reader there was such courage and energy in her voice. When you read her, you knew she wasn't worried about, oh, you know, I'm going against the consensus, I'll be out here on my lonesome. You know, she would make her stand and then, you know, through the magnetic force of her writing, her stand would become the thing that everyone else had to respond to. And you know, also I just love the voice in her writing. It was a very conversational voice but heightened. It didn't have slack to it.__EOS__ How did Pauline Kael first contact you?",3
52751," Let's talk just a little bit about what the rules were and who made them. I mean, clearly nobody expected agents to be paying college athletes, but who actually prohibited it? Who were the governing bodies, and what were the rules?__EOS__ Well, at the time it wasn't against the law. It was simply against the NCAA rules. In fact the NFLPA eventually incorporated NCAA rules, and so did the individual states with the Uniform Athlete Agent Act.__EOS__ Let's just make the , we say the NFLPA, that's the National Football League Players Association, which is, essentially it's the union for the players, right?__EOS__ Right, and they say that agents work at the behest of the union, and they are supposed to be the governing body of the agent community. However, you have to ask yourself a question  Why do they care about the rules of the NCAA? They really don't, and that, I think, in and of itself, shows you why the problems exist the way they do today and will continue to exist because they don't have skin in that game. The individual states...",0
52752," So the main character, Anna Paquin, who's, you know, a high school student, she's there by the dying woman's side, but she's also kind of responsible for the accident because she's very flirtatious, she's very beautiful and kind of knows that she is and dresses, you know, like a little provocatively, the way a lot of teenage girls do.__EOS__ I wanted to do a story about someone who - a door opens to a much larger, more frightening, more difficult world and how they - how she deals with it, especially someone with a great lack of experience in worldly things. It's basically a story of someone who is well-trained in the life of high school and of teenagers, and dealing with something, dealing with a whole slew of consequences of things that happen in the adult world, like death and the legal system and people, the great class differences that exist side by side in a city like New York.__EOS__ It made me wonder, and you might not want to go there, but since you went to a school similar to the upper-middle-class private school in Manhattan that part of the movie is set in, it made me wonder about how you felt about the teenage girls in your school who were beautiful and, you know, flirtatious and often inappropriate in how they used their sexual power. Do you know?__EOS__ Frustrated.",1
52753," It actually makes me think of a passage from the Gospel of Matthew, the part about the final judgment where Jesus talks about the dispossessed, you know, the hungry, the stranger, the prisoner, that when you mistreat them, you mistreat me.__EOS__ Well, I think, really, in a sense, that's the essence of this oratorio. And I think it's also for me, of course, the issue of rebirth because I do actually set the crucifixion and Jesus' death and his resurrection. I couldn't believe that I was doing it, you know?__EOS__ That's composer John Adams. His most recent dramatic work is ""The Gospel According to the Other Mary."" Recordings with the Los Angeles Philharmonic have just been released. John Adams, a real pleasure speaking with you. Thank you.__EOS__ It's been a terrific pleasure. Thank you, Arun.",2
52754," So you have an organized mind. You do a lot of planning.__EOS__ Absolutely. If you match my brain scan to the serial killer, the one-off killer, the normal control, it's a dead ringer for the serial killer. But I have to tell you, I've never been caught and convicted for any homicide, either in Los Angeles or here in Philadelphia. I'm absolutely clean.__EOS__ The only thing I have been done for is smuggling mooncake into Australia from China. I didn't know it was illegal to take mooncake into Australia. But that's my only conviction.__EOS__ So what does it say to you that you have a brain scan similar to an infamous serial killer?",3
52755," Yes, that is exactly what I told my mother.__EOS__ So you not only became a devout Christian, you were evangelizing. You evangelized your own parents. But you remained a Christian for only a few years, and the reason why you left Christianity had to do with becoming a scholar of Christianity. So once you started studying Christianity from a historical and scholarly point of view, what changed your mind about being a believer?__EOS__ Well, in a way it actually started before then. I mean part of the process of evangelizing the Gospel was to prepare myself for the doubts of the unbelievers that I would come across. So I began to really study the New Testament, study the Bible. I wanted to know this stuff inside and out.__EOS__ What's  an example of something that you had learned as an evangelical that you came to question that led you to become more committed to the historical Jesus than to the evangelical version?",0
52756," Right, you went to Syracuse and studied acting, right?__EOS__ Yes, I did.__EOS__ Early in your career, you were in ""Diary of a Mad Housewife,"" and then the Mel Brooks film ""The Twelve Chairs,"" which is one of my all-time favorite movies. And I don't know if people know about it. How did you get that role?__EOS__ I got it because Ann Bancroft and I had done a play together called ""A Cry of Players,"" it's about young Will Shakespeare. And she and Mel were just married, and I was just married, and the four of us, my former wife, deceased wife, and Mel and Ann, became very closer.",1
52757," Yeah, I think we actually have some tape of the very young man you're talking about, Reggie...__EOS__ Reggie Shaw, yes. A wonderful young man.__EOS__ Let's listen to a clip from him.__EOS__ On the way to work, I'm texting. I'm reading messages, and I go across the center line and I hit another car. I don't remember what I was texting. I don't remember what the message said. That's how important it was.",1
52758," Thanks for having me.__EOS__ How upset are people about this issue?__EOS__ Well, people are upset when they hear about these kinds of tracking situations going on. But I tell people they shouldn't be - they could be upset, but they shouldn't be surprised. There's a difference between those. And the reason is that we are being tracked by our devices, by our computer programs, by just being part of modern society. Someone somewhere or multiple someones are tracking you all the time.__EOS__ Is this seen as a particular breach of trust between iPhone customers and Apple or is this just part of the broader, you know, array of the issues, of privacy issues that people are thinking about all the time?",3
52759," And created an artificial lake, and this was a way-station for his drug convoys, right? __EOS__ That's correct. __EOS__ Yeah, yeah. You know, we've been talking about the Taliban more. Is al-Qaida's involvement with the drug trade different from the Taliban? Are they any more ideologically pure? Is Osama bin Laden - do his principles about involvement or distance from the drug trade differ from the Taliban? __EOS__ The story of al-Qaida's involvement in the drugs trade is very, very murky, and it's very difficult to pinpoint, in part because U.S. officials have flip-flopped on their opinions of it so many times. ",0
52760," I think so, yeah. I think in a way, you know, it's almost like we started out kind of like goofing on it but then just sort of became it, in a way.__EOS__ It's the become-what-you-hate syndrome. It happens.__EOS__ Yeah. You set out with an agenda of parody, and a certain amount of time goes by, and you kind of cross that line.__EOS__ Yeah, like you parody something enough, you know.",2
52761," Yeah. __EOS__ I just need to hear this song because I love it. I love them all, but this one, it just, well, this one blew me away. __EOS__ You know what, it sounds as beautiful as the English version in Italian, doesn't it? __EOS__ Yes, it does. Really sound beautiful. ",2
52762,"  So instead of really flying you get kind of carried through the      air... __EOS__  Yeah. __EOS__  ...and it makes it look like you're flying. __EOS__  Yeah.  But we did that in the early days, but we did it with      piano wire. ",3
52763," Consumer Reports magazine really sunk the fortunes of this car in 1986, just a few months after it was officially launched in the U.S., basically recommending that people should buy a used car rather than a brand-new Yugo. Was that sort of the beginning of the end for the car? __EOS__ Oh, absolutely. Consumer Reports panned the car - that's really the end for that car. It's a big deal. I actually interviewed the Consumer Reports person who tested the car and he said the Yugo really wasn't that bad. It was just, for his buyers, wasn't the best quality. But he said the engine was a tried and true Fiat engine that people had used for years and years in Europe and also in the United States. He just said it wasn't put together very well. __EOS__ If you're just joining us, I am sitting inside of a Yugo with Jason Vuic. He is the author of the new book, ""The Yugo  The Rise and Fall of the Worst Car in History."" Arnold Campanile is the driver and owner of this Yugo, and he's very kindly agreed to drive us through the streets of Washington. __EOS__ Yes, I do. I've actually been at stoplights where people roll down their windows and ask if it's for sale. And I tell them, no, at least not at the moment. ",0
52764," ...Everybody said, well, football player, Steelers, Super Bowl ring - you must have plenty of girlfriends and that. And I really didn't. I was an introverted guy as a youngster. And so this pastor from Lauren's Church says, you know, I've got a girl you really need to meet. It's a huge church, and I'm very intimidated. And I don't know. And I put him off for a couple of weeks, too. But he finally got us together. And as soon as I saw her, I knew that she was definitely the one.__EOS__ Well, you know, you sound very strong here, and, you know, I certainly appreciate that. But one of things I also appreciate about the book is you - Lauren, you are very candid about how much it hurt. It did hurt when...__EOS__ Absolutely.__EOS__ ...Your husband was fired, particularly when his successor went on to win the Super Bowl the following year with a team that he put together, we'll just say. But that people saying, oh, well, it's because you're - you know, he's too nice. You know, he couldn't get it done. It's because he was so into this whole family thing, and that, you know, that had to hurt, right?",3
52765," Wow. I mean weren't they thinking about how the Soviets would also get infected? __EOS__ They were. And one of the things that really frightened us is when the first defector came out with the story about this, and we looked down the list of things they were developing, it was bad enough that we saw they were working with smallpox and working with anthrax and other diseases, but one of the fourth or fifth things on the list was we found that they were working on protective measures to protect themselves. So we realized that they were actually thinking about what would happen if they used these because they were designing their own protection. __EOS__ Did any of the germs that they were designing or the anthrax or the smallpox ever get out and infect people? I know there was an anthrax scare. __EOS__ Terry, this was more than a scare. There was an epidemic - an outbreak of anthrax in Sverdlovsk, an industrial city in the Ural Mountains in 1979. More than 64 people died, and I think that this secret - the cover-up of this particular outbreak from a nearby military microbiology facility went on for years. And it kind of became the symbol for the entire program, because if - the Soviets were asked over and over again what happened there. And they said at international meetings and to the press, they said well, it was just contaminated meat. It was a natural outbreak. But this, of course, wasn't the truth. The truth was there had been a leak from this facility, we don't exactly know how. But they never fessed up to that. ",0
52766," No, nobody you know. It is just - years ago, I was in a relationship, and I was basically chased and then dismissed. And, you know, that feels terrible, and I went back to that experience and just shared it with everybody. __EOS__  But you're gone now. You're just gone now. You don't even think about the way I feel 'cause you're gone now. You're just gone now. And I know you should be right here. __EOS__ There are other things in this album that are quite personal, and some very erotic imagery, but also some tough questions that you're asking yourself about that sexuality and what that sexuality does and where you go with that and so forth. And I don't want to sort of reveal all the surprises of the album. But I do wonder what it's going to be like for you to sing those songs day after day. __EOS__ Hmm. Well, every song that I sing, I have to live in the moment. So if there's, you know, a sad song then I need to be sad for the five minutes while I sing it. And it depends on the night. Some nights I'm desperate, just torn apart. And some nights it's a passionate sadness, you know? But whatever the case, I have to get into that mode, into that emotion, because it's more for me than just singing the song. It's, you know, having the soul of the song come through the voice. So when it's time to be sexual and sensual, then that's what I'll be. ",2
52767,"  Well, we just came from the... __EOS__  Think about it, Ariadne. How did you get here? Where are you right now? __EOS__  We're dreaming? __EOS__  You're actually in the middle of the workshop right now. See, the thing is, this is your first lesson in shared dreaming. ",1
52768," Miles, how are drumbeats notated by the composer in the score? Is there a symbol? I mean, I'm thinking of notes here, but... __EOS__ Yeah, yeah, a composer just writes boom in the score. __EOS__ That's the universal symbol, b-o-o-m? __EOS__ Yeah, sure, right, you just write, boom, boom, boom. No. Actually, it's a very good question. It depends on the drum. Timpani are tuned and they play actual notes - notes on the staff. We can use another famous example by the way if you want to hear a timpani playing different notes. The beginning of ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" by Richard Strauss, which there's a famous timpani solo at the beginning and the timpani is playing the notes C and the notes G. ",2
52769,"  Basically it's an oral history.  Nobody's going to do it.      And the people on the other side of--the Soviets, the KGB officers that I      dug out of the woodwork in Moscow to go work this thing over, are gonna      be leaving the scene as well, so it--I look at it as a piece of history. __EOS__  Now this is a different piece of work than a lightheaded memoir      about five years in the Central Intelligence Agency.  The review process,      what was that like? __EOS__  Well, I think it's as your other guest has described it,      you know, it was--you had to be careful.  I went into the project with,      you know, two of my own personal goals which were simple   don't do      anything that hurts anybody that's still out there that may have      collaborated with us, and don't do anything--don't write anything that      makes the job harder for the men and women back there still trying to do      it.  And the review process found a few other things that they didn't      want to get out.  We negotiated a few of them and never any really huge      issue.  You know, the truth is that secrets--the kind of secrets that the      review process wants to keep out of there, for the most part, are boring.      Some of them are a little silly, but for the most part they're rather      boring and they don't take away from the story. __EOS__  Let's get another caller on the line, and Michael's with us from      Washington, DC.

52770," If you're just joining us, my guest is Linda Ronstadt, and she has a new memoir called ""Simple Dreams  A Musical Memoir."" Let's take a short break, here, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ My guest is Linda Ronstadt. She has a new memoir called ""Simple Dreams."" So you form a band with friends, the Stone Poneys, which eventually has the hit ""Different Drum"" in 1967. But that was their second album. The first album, it was a harmony group, and you weren't, like, the lead singer Linda Ronstadt. It was a band. You sang harmonies.__EOS__ Well, Bobby Kimmel was a guy that I met in Tucson. He was kind of a blues guitar player, but he doesn't - but then he writes stuff that wasn't bluesy. He wrote songs and stories about his own life and his own experiences for his own vocal register, which was very different from mine.__EOS__ All right, so this is Linda Ronstadt with the Stone Poneys, the first album that they released.",3
52771,"  Some people say, I want to commit suicide, or prove a woman can cross the desert. Some are inspired or jealous. Others think the trip is a pointless waste of time.__EOS__ The real life trek by Robyn Davidson in 1977 was chronicled in National Geographic. She turned it into a best-selling memoir titled ""Tracks."" And now it's a movie of the same name starring Mia Wasikowska.__EOS__  I don't believe a desire for privacies to be defined or defended. All I know is when it's just me, my animals and the desert, I feel free.__EOS__ And Mia Wasikowska joins me from New York to talk about the film and about those camels. Mia, hi.",1

52773," Unfortunately there are. You know, when I first - when I wrote the book, it was about 25 chance percent chance. Now, you know, as new studies are emerging, it's about 19 percent chance, so we shaved about six percent off, which does very little to ease my mind.__EOS__ When you went back to work, you wrote about your experience for the Post and you looked into this illness. Do we know how long it has been around?__EOS__ You know, basically doctors believe it's been around as long as man. And you know, with that they actually believe that it is a possible cause of demonic possession throughout history, which if you think about - I mean it just blows the mind when you think about that.__EOS__ Meaning people who are believed to be possessed of demons might have had the illness that afflicted you.",0
52774," And then suddenly it's like they're crowning the king of fools and there's all these, like, you know, people trying to look like clowns, and suddenly you see the hunchback's face and he's so deformed and it was - I wasn't prepared for it. I was so frightened.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ And I made my family, like, turn off the television and put on ""Texas Rangers,"" ""Tales of Texas Rangers"" instead. And then I used to, like, sneak a peek at it because it was so scary but thrilling. And then I'd watch the - and then just like - I realized what a beautiful, beautiful film it is.__EOS__ Oh, yeah.",3
52775," So this could have been an opening of sorts, you think?__EOS__ I think - you know, it's the great unanswered question, since we never pursued it. In this case, the hardliners on Iran in the administration won the argument. We're never going to get a situation with Iran where we sit down and hold hands and sing ""Kumbaya."" There are steep and deep divisions between the two countries. We have a relationship that was founded on mistrust, and we built a house over the last 30 years that has done nothing but become more and more unstable.__EOS__ So after the U.S. government turns down Iranian President Khatami's request to go to ground zero and light a candle and to bring additional Revolutionary Guard officers to the security talks in Geneva, shortly after that, President Bush gives his axis of evil speech, and Iran is surprised to hear that they are included in the axis of evil. What did you learn about Iran's reaction to the axis of evil speech?__EOS__ They were stunned. In fact, what it leads to is a complete cutoff by the Iranians of the talks we were having in Geneva and Paris, these quiet talks we were having that started with Afghanistan. They completely cut them off. They released a pretty nasty Afghan warlord they'd been holding, deliberately to tweak the American nose. And it really soured many Iranians who had been hopeful that this might lead to better relations between the two countries.",0
52776," Hi. I'm a naval aviation veteran from the '60s.

52778," Very much so. And that was the reason Manson was furious with Wilson, not just for claiming complete authorship of the song himself...__EOS__ Yes. If you look on ""20/20,"" it just has, you know, it's just credited to Dennis Wilson. There's no Charles Manson credit.__EOS__ But what really hacked Manson off was the fact that Wilson had the nerve to change Charlie's lyrics. He had always told Wilson, you can change my music any way you want to, but you can't change the lyrics. Because if Charlie said it, it must be true. And, as you said, the whole idea cease to exist is - that's Charlie throwing out his philosophy of life to any young woman listener. But Wilson changed all that around.__EOS__ But the line cease to exist is still in the Beach Boys' version, isn't it, even though that's no longer the title?",3
52779," There is, of course, a catch. Dom Cobb was once married. Marion Cotillard plays his former wife, Mal, now a menacing presence in his dreams. __EOS__ He was very passionate and very focused on creating this emotional, cathartic back story for Cobb. So that led us to really delve deep into his past because this story is set in the present, but there's obviously things from his past that keep coming about within the dreamscape that are sabotaging the mission. __EOS__ Did it feel like that when you were working on it? __EOS__ Very much so. You know, I use that word existential, but I've really never had conversations with other actors about scenes like I had on this film, in particular with Marion Cotillard, who is incredible to work with because not only is she an extremely talented actress, but she was really game for these types of sort of strange, philosophical conversations about ho to play a scene where I'm in essence talking to my own conscience, and she is a manifestation of my own trauma. And I'm face to face with that, but I'm also talking to another character in the film who is, in essence, my therapist within the dreamscape, and I'm talking to her about my nightmares. ",1
52780,"  I was approached with the idea of doing a big band project, and I wasn't thrilled at the beginning because I wanted to get to some of my own music.  But as I went through a lot of the charts that my mother bequeathed to me, I saw that many of the songs ranged in anywhere from 13 to 21 pieces, and that they also were songs that just happened to be a lot of my favorites growing up.   __EOS__  ""High Priestess of Soul"" came out in 1967, and what was it about the songs that you chose that make them timeless, as well as a moment that your mother created? __EOS__  Well, it was a personal choice.  I wasn't thinking in terms of what the public would remember or what they would think.  I mainly approached it in terms of how those songs evoked feelings in me from different phases of my life.  Many of them, I've been singing since I was three, four, five years old. __EOS__  Now, your CD opens with your mother introducing you at a concert in Ireland. ",2
52781," Oh, absolutely. I mean, the sultan ordered the building of a mosque, that's one thing, but in the archives you find the records for the building. So you know how much it cost, how long it took, what people were employed, how much they were paid and so on and so forth. It's invaluable economic information, economic and social information.__EOS__ And the source of that data, all of that data, this is huge amounts of information. Has it all been delved?__EOS__ Oh no, there's still a lot there that hasn't been explored. There's still a vast amount of information in the imperial Ottoman archives that haven't yet been used. But there are people working on them now that they admit people. And people go there every year and work in the Ottoman archives, and a good deal of work is being published on them. But there's still a lot more to do.__EOS__ One of your areas of interest when you started out as a young historian was on the Assassins sect, about whom much is imagined but very little is actually known except from your work. And part of the problem was you were able to visit some of their villages in what is now Syria as a young man but then prohibited for many years.",0
52782," And the next is the major third on the minor. __EOS__ So this is the sound. __EOS__ So, you know, it was purposely trying to find these kind of blues sounds and these dissonances to convey with the melody the discordant nature of what I was dealing with. __EOS__  ding, ding, ta-king, ta-king. But I made it sound like the downbeat was actually a beat, too.  Dee dee dum, ba-tu-tu, do dee be dee be dum.  One, two, three.  Ba-tu-tu, do dee be dee be dum… ",2
52783," The film - again - actually has a real relationship, I think, to ""Joan of Arc"" because it is so cinematic. There's hardly any conversation in this entire film. We don't even meet the protagonist, Bobby Sands, until about a half an hour into the film.__EOS__ Do you find yourself doing this in the films that you make; stripping out dialogue until what remains - that the characters actually say - really has an impact?__EOS__ Absolutely. There is always so much more that can be conveyed in the expressions in people's faces, in their body language; and also with sound design, with music. You know, even just juxtaposing certain shots next to each other, you can convey so much in cinematic language through pictures and sound; as opposed to with people telling you how you're supposed to feel, and what you're supposed to think. And it resonates with people more deeply.__EOS__ So we've ranged through recent history, rather distant film history. And we also have on this list ""Harold and Maude,"" from 1971.",1
52784," Yes.__EOS__ Yes. It's difficult to combine the two worlds, right, to find some kind of balance there - where I can embrace that feeling of belonging. And yet, I guess, do what I need to do in reference to my writing, and in reference to my art, and in going out there as, like, sort of, you know, like representative of the world that I'm from.__EOS__ Your brother died in 2000 when he was 19 and you had just graduated college. And you write that eventually you had his name tattooed on one of your wrists to prevent you from slitting your wrists. You thought you wouldn't desecrate his name like that.__EOS__ Yes.",0
52785," ...inside the bulb. __EOS__ It's the glass-blowing technology you have to master, also, on that, I imagine. __EOS__ Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing, you know, yeah. And it really kind of - when you - you know, that's the thing. You kind of think, OK, a light bulb, you know. It shouldn't be that hard. But actually, you know, when you try and do it, you really kind of realize just how much sort of embodied thoughts and sort of technology is kind of in even the kind of simplest of objects. You know, Edison might have blown his own glass, but, you know, he... __EOS__ Right. ",0
52786," Okay. It sounds like our guests have figured out which of these - which is the picture. Let's see what they have to say about it. __EOS__ Well, I will say, you know, another one of those images from Don's lab was the quantum corral, which is also similar - you're probably familiar with a similar technique where they place the atoms around in a corral. __EOS__ George, any final comments? __EOS__ The image, for the listeners, looks like a series of multicolored ice cream cones upside down. ",0
52787," What in the world were you expecting to find because you did have kind of some preconceptions about how this went down?__EOS__ It was true. When I went over there, I wanted to be a real, like, conventional race story, I guess. In the Deep South where, like, a black man has been unfairly imprisoned by hillbillies in the deep South. And I wanted the story to be me almost, like, advocating for this guy. And, you know, in my imagination it'd be, like, me hanging out with his family and then hanging out with his lawyers. And, you know, we're like a team, and I'm writing the book that's sort of, like, advocating for his innocence.__EOS__ There's actually - I'm going to read this. There's actually a little bit here where you're writing about that very idea. I'm quoting here.  I wanted the narrative to be me and the brave McGee family against the system. I wanted to be hanging with the black activist lawyers, but they've cut me off. Worse, I got on smashingly with Jim, the white supremacist. This story isn't working out like it should.__EOS__ Yeah. That was another unfortunate thing. Quite early on I kind of - I hooked up with this white supremacist frenemy of Richard Barrett, the white supremacist who was killed. And, yeah, I sort of just kind of really bonded with him. And it was like - and then when I realized, oh, my God, this is, like, pretty bad for the book. There's no market for a book where, like, the guy's, like, oh, anyway I got on like a house on fire with the white supremacist. Not so much with, like, the family of the black guy who got imprisoned. So yeah, it started just getting messier and messier, I guess. And because this was my first book, I didn't quite work out at that point that messiness is good.",0
52788," That's the strangeness about puppeteers__EOS__ ...do you mind? Excuse me. This is a baby.__EOS__ Oh, she told me that all the time - will you stop it?__EOS__ You know -go and pick up one of your puppets; put her down.",3
52789," So how are the test results used to close schools or to punish teachers? __EOS__ Well, when No Child Left Behind was passed, I don't think that the Congress gave serious thought to what the ultimate results would be down the line. They had some very severe remedies or punishments in the law, for instance, saying that if a school didn't improve its test scores for every single group in the school, and if you weren't on track to be 100 percent proficient for every single child by the year 2014 - which is, for some reason, a magical year - then the school would be subjected to severe punishments. __EOS__ When the neighborhood school closes, where do the students go? To another neighborhood school? __EOS__ No, what happens is that their new schools are opened, and then the new schools, in some cases, are allowed to winnow-out the low-performing kids. So then the administration, the central district, can say  Well, see, our new schools are doing better. ",0
52790," Something else I have to say about your guitar playing. It's all - all the technical virtuosity is in service of the music and the emotion. I just feel like you're such a not showoff player.__EOS__ Yeah. Right. Such...__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ Yeah, it's true, isn't it?",3
52791," For the longest time, I knew that I wanted to make like a dancier song. It was just trying to figure out how exactly I was going to make it. I don't know, I felt like I wanted to incorporate a little bit of psychedelic rock, and then that was with the chords and kind of with the singing too.__EOS__ Well, the song is about how my girlfriend and I moved to California and how change is hard and sometimes not fun. And so mainly, the lyrics are talking about how, even though we're doing something that's completely different and unusual, we're still comfortable, and everything is not as bad as it seemed.__EOS__  Say that you'll always remind me 'cause I can't decide if you are my love. I know I can't always be home but I never left. Don't think like that.__EOS__ Singer-songwriter and music producer Toro Y Moi. His latest album is ""Anything in Return.""",2
52792," Well, I think that kids have a lot more patience to do the same thing over and over again until they get it right. And I think adults often push themselves to get the whole song on the first day. Adults, you know, they've heard the recordings many times, and they don't cut themselves the slack to take things incrementally. And so I think there's a difference in strategy.__EOS__ I have to tell you that I have a guitar that I've owned since I was about 20 years old - 19, maybe. And I was so intent on learning the guitar for like, six months. And then the guitar went into the closet, and I've been schlepping that thing around with me wherever I move. And it just sits in the corner and taunts me. And I've been intimidated to pick it up.__EOS__ I think the first thing is to give yourself slack, and don't expect to learn it overnight. So learning an instrument, for most people, is probably a project of several years. The only way to do the brain rewiring that you need is to practice. There are ways of being a bit more efficient about your practice.__EOS__ Gary Marcus is the author of ""Guitar Zero  The New Musician and the Science of Learning."" We're going to play out with a little bit of your soloing on something called ""Bah-Humbug.""",2
52793,"  Now, look, we're going to do this thing. We're going to have a conversation. Tell me what you did today.__EOS__  I got up.__EOS__  Hmm.__EOS__  I fixed breakfast for my husband.",1
52794," Right.__EOS__ I mean, we're talking about TV shows.__EOS__ Well, I didn't do very many - I mean, I did - you know, I came out of ""Voyage of the Mimi,"" and then I did this afterschool special with Madeline Kahn. And then I did a TV movie with Forest Whitaker and Blair Brown and Beverly D'Angelo and Armand Asante. And then I started sort of auditioning, kind of going to New York and Matt and I would go down and audition.__EOS__ How did auditioning as a child affect you as a director auditioning people today?",1
52795," Clancy, thanks very much for the call. __EOS__ Thanks. __EOS__ Let's go next to - this is Alex, and Alex is on the line from Sacramento. __EOS__ Hi there, Neal. Thanks for hearing me today. ",0
52796," That's right. I think it shows that somebody like Mos Def had been concerned about New Orleans post-Katrina. It has these great lines, oil and water don't mix. Petrolio don't go good with no fish. __EOS__ So suddenly, you got an old New Orleans tune that's kind of upbeat dance tune turned into a narrative about what's been going on and what's the problem in people's lives. __EOS__ Music evolving, as always, in New Orleans. __EOS__ Yeah, it does. And also New Orleans affecting a great player like Mos Def, you know, who comes out of the rap and hip-hop world and decides to go a little more into the local tradition. He even uses some spiritual references, Scripture says, it - they say go to the rock to hide they face. And the rock cried out, no hiding place. ",2
52797," Yeah, you really have - right, right. You really have all four food groups represented right there. __EOS__ Right, I guess the jellybeans are sort of a fruit. __EOS__ Maybe. Now, are you eating around a ping-pong table? __EOS__ Unfortunately no, because we don't have a ping-pong table. I think the first few years when they were little, it was on the floor in front of the TV while watching the special. ",3
52798," Richard Prince, what do you say? Now - and you have a very detailed account, not just of this incident in your - public issue, but also a broader look at Juan Williams' career on your site. So based on that, what do you say? __EOS__ I say that this whole incident is not just about what he said on FOX's O'Reilly show. It's the fact that I think Juan had become a headache that NPR didn't need anymore. This is not the first time something like this has happened. And they decided, you know, look, we're in the middle of a pledge drive for our local affiliates. People are deciding whether to give money. We don't need this. __EOS__ But where's the line, though? Where's the line? I mean, my commentary is on Monday, ""Can I Just Tell You?"" __EOS__ Yes. ",3
52799," One other bit of legislation I want to mention, and that's the Conscription Act, which for the third time in American history created a draft. Was that a very unpopular piece of legislation?__EOS__ The conscription bill was one of the most unpopular pieces of legislation, at least in the beginning, because we only had had a draft twice in our history before  the Civil War and World War I. The idea of a standing army was anathema to most Americans, as it had been to the founding fathers. We just didn't do that. I mean, that was not in the American scheme of things.__EOS__ We've had a lot of debates in the past few decades in the United States over whether or not to enter a war or how deep into that war to get. I mean, after World War II, the big debate over Vietnam and then, you know, the debate about whether to intervene in the war in Bosnia. And then you've got Iraq and Afghanistan, debates over whether to bomb Iran or not.__EOS__ I think that students felt strongly because they were going to be the ones, you know, on the front lines if we got into the war. And they felt incredibly strongly that the First World War hadn't worked and that all these young Americans had been killed, and they didn't want to be next.",0
52800," No, I understand what you're saying. I mean Annapolis, for example, where our naval academy is located - is a similar place. It's a lovely town visited by many tourists and so forth. But this is also the largest home in the area and had some very unusual habits. And so I think that raises questions. __EOS__ No, I think, again, I have read the paper or in the media that this had high walls. Many houses, many, many houses. And the Bataan, or Frontier Province people, live in houses with high walls. I have seen pictures of that house. I haven't visited that place. I don't see anything abnormal in that house. __EOS__ Two more questions, Mr. President. You've been generous with your time and we certainly appreciate it. Americans aren't the only ones who have become skeptical about ongoing aid. For example, Imran Khan, a former cricket star, now a politician in Pakistan, has also argued against Pakistan continuing to accept foreign aid. His argument being that the money really isn't going to help development of civil society in Pakistan. It really gets siphoned off to the ruling elite. Do you think he's wrong? __EOS__ Well, I think he's wrong. The issue of whether the money is misused at the government level, I won't like to comment on that. Yes, there are charges of extreme corruption at the government level. But to think that this will all be siphoned off and it's useless giving any money to Pakistan, I don't think agree with this statement. ",3
52801," I do. I had experienced some anti-Semitism as a kid, and the Constitution, I talked about what the Constitution meant to me as a young Jewish kid and how much comfort it gave me to know that I had a constitutional protection. I could run into problems, but you know, that I was equal. And that was, you know, that was enormously important to me. __EOS__ That's The Long View from Norman Lear, and tomorrow we'll get the long view from a very different Hollywood figure, an actress who got her big break in 1928. __EOS__ It was a contract to come to Hollywood. I just couldn't believe it. I slept with this contract under my pillow. __EOS__ The sweetheart of Mexico tells her story tomorrow on The Long View. You can hear 25 other conversations in our Long View series, from Alan Greenspan to Eartha Kitt, at npr.org. and you're hearing it on MORNING EDITION from NPR News.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",3
52802," And that book was very highly anticipated. I didn't realize it until I read your book just how much people were already sort of heralding it as a great novel before it was even published. Why was there so much expectation for him and for that book? __EOS__ I think, for a start, there was already this big movement that was just about to be called the boom in Latin-American fiction in the 1960s. There were lots of writers around who were going to be top writers who are known to anybody who reads these days, like Fuentes and Vargas Llosa and so on. But it wasn't so clear that there was a movement, but there were people who wanted a movement. So that was the one thing. There was a need for an even bigger book. But I think the biggest thing of all is that the book made - I mean, I can still remember - I was a young man then. I was in Mexico City. I read the book six months after it came out. And you had to be there at the time. You had to be in the 1960s. You had to be in the world of the Beatles and Third World revolution, psychedelia, lots of things, to understand now what impact the first page of that book had. __EOS__ Can you remind us of what those lines are? Do you have them memorized? __EOS__ More or less. It's almost correct. ",0
52803," And that is because of the struggles of our ancestors. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ And the struggle is not over. We got a long way to go. __EOS__ Well, that's another thing we're going to be talking about as we go -continue in this program. Denise, thank you very much for the phone call. We appreciate it. ",2
52804,"   Well, it's difficult for any candidate to win Ohio, Republican or Democratic candidate. Ohio is one of those swing states and in order to win Ohio, you've got to appeal to a very diverse state. We have a little bit of everything in Ohio that is found in the larger country. And I do believe, though, that the candidate that wins Ohio will be the candidate that talks specifically and convincingly about the economic circumstances facing our state and our nation. __EOS__ You know, it seems like Barack Obama has an uphill climb there. He carried only five of the state's 88 counties. __EOS__ He carried the larger metropolitan areas of Ohio, our larger cities. But it is true that in order to carry Ohio, you have to appeal to all of Ohio. And I think he can be successful, because I think he's going to have an economic message that will have appeal to the people of Ohio who are facing very difficult economic circumstances. Whichever candidate has the most compelling economic message, I believe, will be the candidate that carries Ohio in November. __EOS__ Governor, it's interesting to listen to you talk about Barack Obama's economic message. When you announced your endorsement, you issued a statement that said Ohioans have suffered as a result of the failed policies of the Bush administration. You said that Ohioans desperately want real, meaningful change, and you said that I believe Barack Obama will bring that change. And it's interesting because all throughout the primary season, you were saying just the opposite thing. You were saying that he did not have the right prescription for the economy. ",3
52805," How long were you in the orphanage? __EOS__ I was in the orphanage for close to seven years. __EOS__ What did your mother tell you when she put you there? __EOS__ She said that I'd be at a school where I could learn so much more than if I was in an average school, but it was a sleep-in school. I'd have to stay there. And... ",1
52806," UT's center for American History threw a party at the top of an Austin skyscraper to celebrate this addition to its archive. __EOS__ A guitar duo played Beatles covers. Pete Townshend of The Who regaled the crowd with tales of meeting Tom Wright, then a young American art student in England. __EOS__ Without Tom coming into my life, I don't think I would have heard the music that I heard that was so important for me when I was a kid, particularly R&B, which Tom exposed me and a bunch of people at Ealing Art School to around '62 and '63, but also drugs. __EOS__ In 1967, Wright managed The Who's very first U.S. tour. Wright says he met the band in Florida. They got on the plane. It started to take off. ",0
52807," ...I use all that stuff for my face now. __EOS__ They have a whole facial line, too? __EOS__ Unbelievable. __EOS__ I didn't know that. ",0
52808," Not a dread of being on stage, a dread of not doing well, of disappointing them. I  you know, I always  you think  I have one friend who's a very good, very, very famous comedian, comic, who once said to me  I give them five minutes. If they don't like me, I go on automatic. __EOS__ They have bought the tickets, they have paid for a babysitter, they have come out to see you. They want to have fun. I want them to walk out of a show and say, that's the best show I've ever seen. __EOS__ I'm glad you said that. How did you get them back because this was a moment of uncharacteristic anger on stage. So where do you go from there? __EOS__ Oh, my darling. You just start talking fast, and you start finding where will they start to relax and laugh again? And it's almost like, you know, when you start a car, and finally the motor goes, and it took me about four minutes to get them back. ",1
52809," Like what the standard in the industry… __EOS__ Yeah, what the standard was at whatever his level at that job was, but I think that's terrific that he was successful to counter their offer with a higher offer and then they accepted it. So you know when they made the first offer, they obviously had low-balled it. __EOS__ But that principle stands as to whether you're negotiating for a salary for a first baseman or for somebody, a salesman. __EOS__ Absolutely - no, it does. ",0
52810," 'Cause there's a problem with the deal. __EOS__ Oh no, man. Ain't no problem, man. Ain't no problem I can't fix. Look, we're getting this money, man. __EOS__ No, listen to me  you cannot take this deal. Caz, listen to me, you cannot take this deal. __EOS__ Why, Tango? ",1
52811," Do you want to play another song? __EOS__ Sure. This is a new one. __EOS__ So I hope I don't stuff it. __EOS__  We started out, we were much younger. You taught me the fire, and I taught you the hunger. I remember love, but love don't remember me. Then we went out, we got much older. You waited like an angel, and I pined like a soldier, but I remember love, but love don't remember me. ",2
52812," It seemed to me that absolutely everything at that particular stage had a meaning, like a fire hydrant seemed intimately connected to the city and to the lives of the people that had been lost. Or a child's drawing had as much meaning as something that the best artist in the world could have done. And so it seemed to me that the way to confront this was perhaps to go in another direction and to go into the past. __EOS__ Colum McCann just won the National Book Award for his novel ""Let the Great World Spin."" The book includes a photo of the World Trade Center. A jet plane flies nearby. At first you think you know exactly what that photo shows. And then you see a rope stretched between the Twin Towers. You realize this is a photo not from 2001 but from 1974. __EOS__ Yeah, there was a man walking a quarter of a mile in the sky - sort of higher than any other walking man could have been in New York at that particular time, a man who stretched a tightrope between two towers that are now gone, and in certain ways he's still down there because that's the sort of technology of memory and image, that we can imagine that Philippe Petit is still walking the air, literally a quarter of a mile above Manhattan. __EOS__ He was a daredevil. The World Trade Center Towers weren't even finished, and he quite illegally stretched this tightrope from one tower to the other and just walked right across. ",0
52813,"  In my first tour, I didn't have as clear a sense for it as      I did in my second, as a father finally.  You raise a child for 18 or 20      years, and your job is to protect them.  That's your job.  And when they      go to war, you can't.  I had the same thought my father did.  You know,      `Today's the day I'm not coming back.'  I'd look at my young Marines and      I'd hope it wasn't them.  And although you hear numbers going up--you      know, we finally crossed the 2,000 service members killed in Iraq, it      began to feel in the news like it was a stock.  You know, 2,000 families      that are destroyed, and we're probably getting close to 15,000 wounded.      Those are numbers which continue; you know, the stock doesn't go down. __EOS__  Frederick Busch, could you write when your son was deployed in      Iraq? __EOS__  I wrote.  The job of a writer is to create structure and      to find right language so as to be able to tell what he or she thinks is      the truth.  And the search for right language and the invention of      structure help to give the writer himself a sense of being held together      as his structure holds together the inchoate experiences he's trying to      write about.  And I do not pray.  I am not an observer of any organized      faith.  And I think the closest I was able to come to prayer was to write      this essay as a way, if you will, of bringing Ben home. __EOS__  There's something that's missing from the article which I'd like      to ask you about.  What was the homecoming like? ",0
52814," Laitha, thank you very much for the call. We'll get one more call on cancer, then we're going to turn a corner with you, Barbara. Karen is with us. Karen, calling from Evanston. __EOS__ Hi. I am so delighted to be able to thank Barbara for the articles that she wrote earlier in the decades that I read in 2007, when I was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. It was such a relief for me to be able to read those articles that other patients passed on to me, and to know that I wasn't crazy for not listening to the people who told me that I needed to be cheerful when I had - even a friend who had curable cancer told me it was my responsibility to stay positive. __EOS__ Well, they say that yeah, depression as anger turned inwards. There maybe something to that, but I could only speculate. But thank you for telling you that what I wrote made you feel less crazy. I was very frightened when I first wrote about my experience and my response to all this cheerfulness - artificial cheerfulness. But mostly, you know, the responses have been from other women who were just silenced by it and intimidated by it. __EOS__ Karen, continued good luck. ",0
52815," When you were an Islamist, what was your understanding of blasphemy? Because the jihadis who murdered the cartoonists believed that they were guilty of blasphemy.__EOS__ You know, it's interesting, Terry, because I've often commentated that satire, the lampooning and criticizing political thought and irony and indeed sarcasm, are concepts that are often lost on Islamists and jihadists and generally on religious fundamentalists and religious conservatives.__EOS__ What does the Quran have to say about blasphemy? You memorized half of the Quran when you were in prison in Egypt.__EOS__ Yes, there's an Arabic phrase used in the Quran. It's called  which means mocking or ridiculing the religious symbols. The Quran is very clear on the prohibition of  or on the prohibition of mocking the prophet and mocking God.",3
52816," ...which is their program that airs on QXR in New York, it's produced by WFMT in Chicago. I've been the radio announcer for them. This is my third - the end of my third season just ended. That's one of my favorite things I've ever done because just to be a part of that, such a soothing and an elegant world of the classical repertoire is such a joy for me. And then I have my own show on WNYC, ""Here's the Thing,"" that podcasts on the NYC website, and then we're going to go to broadcast I think this fall. And that I've really enjoyed as well because I love to talk to people and get down to a different kind of conversation about, you know, not so much the facts like well, then you did this and then you did this, and then you did this, and more talk about how they feel about what they do and what they're really - and try to ask questions that I know I don't get asked that often and I had a hunch that they didn't either.__EOS__ You know, you've talked about running for office also at times, mayor of New York, the Senate. Is that something you still think about?__EOS__ Well, I think that it's tough these days, I mean I've had these difficulties lately with the press. I've had this stuff here in New York where I was - this guy almost hit me in the face with a camera here in New York the other day. And I find that it's very, very difficult now to navigate those waters. I mean everybody I've ever worked with, you know, 99.9 percent of the time I've had a successful or at least, you know, a very agreeable experience with. And there are these legit press opportunities you have that you do. And then there's what I call the illegitimate press and they, in the age of the Internet, they're very strong. They're very omnipresent. And dealing with them becomes, I think for me, what I'm learning now in this last go-around is that my desire to live a normal life - like to have an apartment in New York and a home in New York and to walk out the door like any other New Yorker does and just live my life, it - sometimes it's not possible. And I know people who live this much more insulated life in Los Angeles where their feet, like, never touch public ground. They walk out of their bathroom, they walk out of their living room, they walk into their garage, they get into their car and the next thing you know they're at the valet parking of the restaurant or the store or the office. They're just never - they're in a bubble the whole time. It's very hermetic. And I never wanted to live that kind of life. I hated that idea. But I'm beginning to see now how it really does becomes necessary, kind of. It's sad. It makes me sad, but it's true.__EOS__ Well, Alec Baldwin, it's been great. Thank you so much for joining us.",1
52817," Yes. __EOS__ A tainted Pulitzer. __EOS__ Yes, of course. I mean, you know, novelists are attracted; we're drawn to sort of lowlifes and bottom feeders. They're such interesting characters, and they're fun to write about, and they're fun to bring to life on the page. And I'd been wanting to write about a paparazzo for a long time. __EOS__ Early in the book, you take us into his world by giving us a glimpse of his BlackBerry... ",0
52818," And what kind of answers was he getting from people?__EOS__ Well, I think the most disturbing thing about it is some of the people who wrote back to him explained their reasons for not being willing to allow these journalists into these schools were blatantly anti-Semitic. For example, the director of the University of Illinois School of Journalism, in explaining to Friedrich why he wasn't willing to participate, said--or wrote  ""The minute the Jews show up in numbers they become a threat to the others as they reveal that they would occupy all the jobs there are, and that they are quite likely to work together in filling the jobs."" He goes on to say, ""We must keep them from being too prominent and assertive and from threatening to take over all the other white- collar jobs. It is simply a case that we must hurt them to help them.""__EOS__ But you acknowledge in your article that anti-Semitism even of a genteel variety was not the only explanation of what was going on here?__EOS__ No, and I don't think it was. I think that there were differences between American journalism schools and European newspaper institutes. But I think what makes this to me particularly interesting is many of those things would've been true of other disciplines, of the legal profession, of the medical profession. And yet in almost every other case, they were at least willing to take some Jewish refugees onto their faculty, or in the case of the law schools, to admit some refugees to their law schools. The difference was that journalism wasn't willing to do anything.",3
52819," Right, and how much of it was because of his particular... __EOS__ Ultimately it didn't change things that much. Literally, it was like bit by bit. It was just almost like I didn't need exposition. I didn't need a back story about, you know, with this character. And that's something I'm always trying to avoid. __EOS__ I wanted to talk about ""The Visitor,"" which was your second film, also very well-received and a terrific movie. It deals with a, kind of a lonely economic professor and his encounter with two illegal immigrants. __EOS__ You know, it's a similar reason for why I cast Paul Giamatti in ""Win Win."" I think both of these actors present a face and just an essence that audiences can relate to immediately as a neighbor, you know, as a family member, as the guy next door, the guy on the street, and this everyman quality. I know that's a bit of an overused term, but they really have that. Maybe there's something that they're not conventional leading men in that sense. So I feel like there is - it makes them more accessible to audiences. ",1
52820," What is that?__EOS__ You know, it's funny. Gareth Edwards, the director, asked us that same question. You know, we spent - we started on the roar almost three years ago and it took about six months to get to that point. And Gareth asked us straight up, OK, what is that? And we actually decided not to tell him until a little over a month ago when we had finished the film because it's kind of like a magic trick.__EOS__ Oh, come on, Ethan. Nobody's listening. Just whisper it in my ear.__EOS__ We actually were sworn to take it to our graves with us so - no lie - by Thomas Tull, the head of Legendary. So...",1
52821," Well, I know people like that. But whether they have the rich and alarming secret lives I've wished on them, I don't know. I wouldn't like to say.__EOS__ How do you actually approach the language, the writing? I mean, there are so many moments in this book that - and words that I intend to use. You describe Betty's decision to marry Graham, you say  she wasn't wholly infatuated. Though she liked the way he looked, but so, too, did he and that unfatuated her a bit.__EOS__ That just came to me as I was writing. That was just a similarity of infatuated and unfatuated. I don't think unfatuated is a word.__EOS__ No, it's not. It should be, though.",0
52822," Well, we  yeah, we didn't need to use the system like that at all. __EOS__ When the earthquake in Haiti happened, you know, you guys would probably have to kind of just start shot-gunning right into it, picking this topic, picking that topic. Like, how did you start selecting it down? __EOS__ And related to the Haiti story? Well, it means background on, you know, geo... __EOS__ Geography. ",0
52823," Pretty ballsy. __EOS__ �incredible to think about. Well, ballsy, yeah - that's the word, I guess. __EOS__ Yes, dressing the part, showing up thinking they could do it. And then it's even more frightening that they actually were able to do it. __EOS__ Well, Amy Zantzinger, thanks for taking time off on Thanksgiving to talk with us. Appreciate it. ",3
52824," Yes. If she is still party planning chairman. __EOS__ That's right. __EOS__ We'll see what happens with that. __EOS__ Well, she and Phyllis have been arguing over this a long time. ",1
52825," Just a little shot of bourbon or something. I don't even know what they had. I just asked, you know, for something, and...__EOS__ Whatever. __EOS__ And I just wanted something to just take the edge off because I was beyond nervous. Who gets to do a sex scene when you're, you know, 50 - whatever? No one really gets to - not too many women get to do that.__EOS__ You know, it's interesting that as you're doing ""Masters Of Sex,"" which is based on the real work that Masters and Johnson did in sex research - and that's a drama. And you're also in a sitcom called ""Mom,"" which deals a lot with sexuality, too, but it's a much more sitcom-ish approach.",3
52826," Yeah, salaries are dictated by the market. You can say that a $1.5 or $1.6 million salary in a marginally profitable, $12 million business is a lot, but sports have never been about market logic in colleges. It's been about intangibles. Calhoun has won two national championships. His success has spurred donations. It's enhanced the school's appeal. It's helped fund other sports. But Calhoun smirked that he wouldn't give back a dime. Well, guess what? Other states are making coaches do their part, however small. __EOS__ That'll be interesting. Now, the economics of state universities are very complex. How much oversight do states exercise over the spending by school athletic departments? __EOS__ You know, not that much. The economy and Calhoun's behavior, though, might prompt legislators in Connecticut and elsewhere to ask how their state-run universities spend money to run their programs and to recruit athletes. What standards do schools impose when they are pursuing high school basketball and football players? Because a lot of money changes hands when athletes are recruited by big universities. __EOS__ Stay on the case. Have a great weekend. ",3
52827," He even cooks for himself.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ He uses public transportation. He's been - many people have seen him, you know, on the bus. He rejects a lot of the comforts that are available to leaders of his position, and I think many people feel that that would be a refreshing change of tone or a refreshing signal, along with the name that he chose.__EOS__ Well, I think it's a very complicated role and I think that's still - that story's still going to evolve. I mean part of what has happened is there was a book written about him - I believe a couple of years ago - with the title ""El Silencio,"" where he - they accuse Cardinal Bergoglio of not taking care of two priests who had been kidnapped and being complicit with the junta. There's also talk about problems that he had during the time that he was a provincial in Argentina and his stance against liberation theology and how he cracked down on the Jesuits who were being trained there.",3
52828," And it really is just four guys. I mean...__EOS__ For lack of a better phrase, four guys.__EOS__ For lack of a...__EOS__ Four guys.",2
52829," And 'cause actors have bills, too. __EOS__ And maybe they didnt really have as much choice as you're talking about. I find thats certainly been the case with me and continues to be, thankfully. I mean, and I know it will probably change. You know, Im in a place now where I actually am getting offers to do things and thats a really exciting place to be. You know, to not have to take just every job that comes your way. You know, but that could very well change next week. __EOS__ Well, it's great to talk to you. __EOS__ You, too. Thank you. ",1
52830," If youre just joining us, my guests are Joel and Ethan Coen and their new movie is ""True Grit."" __EOS__ My guests are brother Joel and Ethan Coen. They write and direct their films together. Their new film is ""True Grit."" When we left off, we were talking about the 2009 film, ""A Serious Man,"" which is set in 1967 in a suburb of Minnesota. __EOS__ Not that we saved, but that we found. Absolutely. __EOS__ Okay. What things? ",1
52831," Polymeric. __EOS__ Polymeric, OK. Many partners, in other words. __EOS__ Yeah, well, potentially many partners. In other words, that it's not committed to just the two people. There are others… __EOS__ But it can be emotionally rich and emotionally involved. Laura Sessions Stepp, did you encounter anything like that in your surveys through this culture? ",0
52832," ...Most popular basketball player, most popular kid in the school. Those first text messages between Steve and Saba are awkward and sweet. What do they...__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ What do they see in each other?__EOS__ Well, for sure, Saba sees in Steve what everybody else sees - a good-looking, popular, class president, star athlete. He represents a kind of teenage life that hasn't - she hasn't had access to until this relationship. And for Steve, he sees in Saba, again, a student who suddenly is at the center of the school social map. And he wonders if there might be something there for him. He's curious about her. And he wants to help her, like everybody else in the school. So their relationship is awkward at first.",0
52833," You know, I think it will get a few. But I think two things. Really, the mix between spending and tax cuts could be better from our standpoint of view - from our standpoint, I mean. And then the overall size of the package - it's really a $1.2 trillion package. And I think many of us have a concern that that will really put too large a burden on our children and grandchildren. __EOS__ Representative Camp, in the Senate it's conceivable that the stimulus package will actually require Republican votes. At least if there's a cloture vote, there might have to be some Republican support for it to be passed. But in the House, it could pass without any Republican votes. How important is it to you that the stimulus bill have some kind of bipartisan support to it? Or are you perfectly happy being completely outside the tent on this one? __EOS__ Well, I think going forward, large bills like this do better if they have bipartisan support. I don't think in the House you're going to see a lot of Republican support for this, simply because we've not been able to have input on the priorities. __EOS__ Just one last point about tax cuts for people who in effect would be getting back more taxes than they pay. Aren't those precisely the people who instantly spend the money and put it into the economy because frankly they are in no position to save? And they'll go spend it on the store which might be owned by somebody who pays taxes at a higher rate, or they might spend it and buy a car from a car dealer who pays taxes at higher rate. That's part of the argument for... ",3

They didn't quite get hip-hop at first, but they were supportive of me participating in hip-hop, definitely. And then, once they saw I participated in it and they saw how I did it and then they got to know about The Roots and Nas and Mos Def and they started to see other examples, then they came around to it, too.__EOS__ Well, Talib Kweli, thank you so much for speaking with us.__EOS__ Oh, no, this has been a pleasure.

52837," A little tidbit is fine.__EOS__ I had actually left the poetry scene to study acting, and after five years my coach said to me that she thought I was ready and that she was convinced that if someone saw me, that they would give me an opportunity. And she said, you've just got to get on stage any way that you know how and you know how to get on stage.

It's based on the first book of author Suzanne Collins' trilogy aimed at young adults. Of course, the best-sellers have already caught fire with readers of all ages. The story is set in post-apocalyptic North America, where the government squashed a revolution and has continued to flaunt its power with an extreme and violent tradition.__EOS__  Until it was decreed that each year, the 12 districts of Pan Am shall offer up in tribute, one young man and woman, between the ages of 12 and 18, to be trained in the art of survival, and to be prepared to fight to the death.",1
52839," Now, you met her when the - many people might remember this, but in case some people don't - back in 1996, the beef industry threw defamation claims at her after she had done a program warning about the possible sort of health risks associated with beef. And then you became, you know, friends in the course of that trial. __EOS__ Well, that's a really good question. And you're right. I was on her defense team up in Amarillo, Texas. And I got to know her really well because I worked with her for a couple of years, actually, leading up that trial, and then during the trial we lived together, a small group of us lived together in a bed and breakfast out on the edge of town for almost two months, as I recall. And so she's my ex-roommate. We all lived out there together. And I really got to know her well and we became very dear friends, as we are today. __EOS__ I'll play a clip of Oprah Winfrey describing your contributions to the program. Here it is. __EOS__ He gave us more ah-ha moments than we could count. ",3
52840," You know, I don't think that the changes that Douglas Feith is suggesting would have made a fundamental difference. There had to be some kind of occupation. There was no way security was going to be provided in Iraq by the so-called externals and their followers. Someone had to run the streets. Someone had to take on the militias that immediately filled the vacuum that we left, and that had to be the U.S. Army. There was no way around it, whether Paul Bremer was sitting in the Republican palace, or Ahmed Chalabi or someone else. __EOS__ Very briefly, setting aside details, is Feith correct in the broad picture of a Bush administration that just couldn't agree and basically was paralyzed on key decisions? __EOS__ Yes, he is. They were pulling in different directions and working across purposes. Look, the Iraq War was always a long shot, but it was made immeasurably longer by its principle architects in Washington, including Douglas Feith, who ignored expert advice, reserved most of their effort for fighting each other in ideological battles, and regarded the Iraqi people as an afterthought. __EOS__ Thanks very much. That's George Packer. Douglas Feith's book is ""War and Decision,"" and at npr.org, we'll ask him who suddenly altered post-war plans. It's NPR News.  Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0
52841," Well, he was so far ahead of his time. I mean, he was just - he was seeing things, you know, talk about being ahead of the curve. I mean, he was seeing around the corner. You know, and you look at a film like The Matrix or the David Cronenberg film eXistenZ or another sort of film that came out right about the same time - there was sort of this, you know, little burst of what is reality films - there was one called The Thirteenth Floor where nothing was what it seemed to be. And it was all, I think - it was just sort of, you know, people catching up with Philip K. Dick, sort of getting on the Dick bandwagon, as it were. __EOS__ Hmm. Let's get Jim on the line. Jim's calling us from Phoenix. __EOS__ Yes, now, tell me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me I recall - and this goes along with your comment about his fear of government control and what-not - but the original concept of the book of the Blade Runner, and hence the name the Blade Runner, was doctors that were working outside of government control. In other words, they were surgeons, blade runners... __EOS__ Mm-hmm. ",0
52842," As you allude to, there was - all of a sudden, there was tension within the group because things got so good, so quickly. Was there anyone that you, as a girls' club, had who was sitting down with you, telling you  This is stuff you have to look out for, these are some roadblocks. __EOS__ Well, I remember getting a lecture from John Belushi on the evils of drugs, you know, when I broke out my measly little half-gram - like, look what I have. And he gave me a big lecture, saying, when you become rich and famous one day, people are going to give you lots of drugs, and you have to be careful and - besides that, I don't remember getting any sort of nurturing. __EOS__ Did you take that to heart when he... __EOS__ No. ",2
52843," the war resistors, the men who refused the draft and the soldiers who refused to fight.__EOS__ Hochschild makes a reader feel anew the shock of modern technological warfare. He renders the pacifist tales no less compelling than those of the soldiers in the trenches. He also enlarges on the question  What does it take for a person to shake off the shackles of conventional wisdom and think for him or herself? What punishments does society mete out? What apologies does posterity sometimes offer to those courageous enough to see things differently?__EOS__ Hochschild's other books include ""King Leopold's Ghost"" and ""Bury the Chains."" We spoke last year, when the hardback edition of ""To End All Wars"" was published. Adam Hochschild, welcome back to FRESH AIR.

52844," You're carrying a book in your hands. And the headline over this billboard is  swoon-worthy. And I thought, what? I mean... __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ I mean, the whole novel is all about how you can't really go into that kind of swoon anymore in literature. __EOS__ Well, I can - I think that this book is actually a true love story, and I think it has all the elements of a love story, and I think it satisfies those traditional expectations at the same time as it's obviously aware of them. So in terms of the book being romantic, that's fine. Swoon-worthy is maybe not my favorite description of it. And, you know, the billboard is embarrassing to me. They told me they were going to do a billboard, but my publisher is, you know, famously cheapo, and I figured it would be a tiny little billboard on some side street that no one would see. And then I was doing an interview, and they led me out to see this thing... ",3

I'm actually thinking of going down for a week to help get out the vote. __EOS__  And the mother says, I love hearing you so passionate about something. Pauses a few beats, and then the mother says, you've been in such a funk lately, I can't remember the last time I've seen you excited about anything. I'm so happy! __EOS__ So what happened right there? __EOS__ Okay, the daughter was sharing something positive. The mother first gives her praise, and then goes on to compare the present good state with a previous bad state, and that's what the daughter zeroes in on, and this is how she reacted. ",0
52846," They see the demon as holding sway over a large area, so over not just the mosque but the entire people group.

Several groups have come together for another The Call event which will be in Detroit on November 11th. And the purpose of this one is to fight the demonic spirit of Islam. __EOS__ So the event is in Detroit, which is very near Dearborn, Michigan, which has I think the - or one of the largest populations of Muslims in the United States. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ Is that significant?

52847," The History of Filibustering in Congress."" He's an assistant professor of political science at the University of Miami. __EOS__ Right now, a filibuster means that some senator or group of senators will not allow the Senate to set a time for voting on a bill or nomination. And what they are threatening is that they will speak forever, although they won't actually be forced to speak forever. And the way that majorities in the Senate typically respond to that is by filing for a cloture petition, and it takes 60 votes to successfully invoke cloture. And what that does is it limits debate on a bill or nomination to 30 hours. __EOS__ The impression many people have now is that the filibuster is being used by Republicans to block just about any piece of legislation that the Democrats are trying to pass. Having studied the history of the filibuster, do you think that the filibuster is being used more frequently now and for more reasons now than has ever historically been true before? __EOS__ Over the last 20 years, we sort of reached a very high plateau for filibustering in which any senator feels comfortable threatening to filibuster legislation or nomination. And since a minority party is usually more than 40 - holds more than 40 seats in the Senate, that usually means that if they stick together, they can block any piece of legislation. ",0
52848," Yes I am. __EOS__ I want to give full credit to KPCC in Pasadena there. So what do we know about the health effects of noise? __EOS__ Most are bad. There are a few good, but most are bad. As you said, noise increases stress levels and stress in turn increases a variety of maladies from increase of the probability of high blood pressure and heart attack and stroke and those kinds of things. __EOS__ And, you know, you wonder about it because you could be sitting next to somebody with a pair of headsets on and you hear it almost as loud as they hear it.

52849," That would be a record… __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ …but I can understand it. He was perhaps hyper-focused on the music, thinking about what he wanted to accomplish on that stage, thinking about his colleagues and some chat and shot he goes about his business and remembers.

And part of this authenticity means understanding that people's words, and also their memories, are filtered in the course of the movie. They're precipitated by his questions and then they're filtered through the interpreter. __EOS__ Because filmmaker Claude Lanzmann believes that the truth lies in the details, he pushes his subjects aggressively, though that's not a term he appreciates. Lanzmann points to the long, difficult scenes with survivor Abraham Bomba. __EOS__ I have asked you and you didn't answer  What was your impression the first time you saw arriving these naked women with children?

52852," But is it reflective of a general clubiness in the business world? A clubbiness that locks out women and minorities, especially at the higher levels.__EOS__ Yes and certainly if you look at the S&P 500, there isn't one out gay CEO. So it is a clubby experience and I think many people have an unconscious bias. They do tend to select people like themselves. And so therefore, they select out people who are a bit different.__EOS__ What kind of regrets have you had about what more you could have done had you come out when you were CEO? Not just for your personal life, but for workers and creating the kind of environment you're asking other businesses to create now?__EOS__ Well, I wish I could have done that. It's all hypothetical, of course, because I didn't. I wish I were out and was a role model. I hope I can make up for lost time by doing what I can now to encourage people to be role models, to come out, be role models so that people can see how you can succeed regardless of your sexuality.",0

This man and woman are - make no secret about the fact that they are allegedly a prostitute and a pimp. And they're trying to get advice on how to get loans, which is something that ACORN usually advises low-income people to do. And they're very up front.

52856," Okay. You know, because you mention in your book that there is a big warfare going on about cheddar, let's concentrate on cheddar. __EOS__ Yeah. Cheddar is the first chapter of the book that's not sort of an introduction and - because to me that's sort of the quintessential American cheese. And I went to visit the Amish to try and learn about the history of cheddar and it was a dismal failure. They've really only been making cheese for about 35 years. And they said, well, we don't know. Thanks for coming. __EOS__ But I've done a lot of research. I'm actually writing an article on cheddar right now. And so, I brought a block cheddar, which is the cheddar I grew up with, you know, think Cracker Barrel. It's square and it doesn't have any kind of rind on the outside. And then, I brought what's called a clothbound cheddar which is an English - traditional English style. It's made in a wheel, not a block. And it's got cloth, cheesecloth, that's wrapped around the outside and it's aged not in plastic Cryovac packaging, but in a clothbound wheel, aged in a cave, a temperature and humidity-controlled room.

52858," Well, I guess as a poet and a political activist most consistently. I mean I've written in all genres. As a matter of fact, I have a play opening next week. But, you know, I guess throughout all of that the poetry is at the base of it. __EOS__ You have in this compilation a section where you describe the difference between poetry and short story. It's called “Northern Iowa.” What do you think are the differences between those two crafts that you pursue? __EOS__ Well, poetry tends to be more spontaneous and direct, you know. The poet is someone I think who's interested in registering experience immediately or giving you the sense of immediacy and directness. Even writing drama, though, I try to be, you know, have a poetic voice. And finally, I think maybe this is poet chauvinism, but I think that even to write essays one has to still have a kind of rhythmic drive to get the highest consciousness out of your soul. __EOS__ Do you see a connection between the African oral tradition of the griot and the poetry that infuses your work and then infuses your nonfiction, your essays, everything? ",0
52859," Hello, pleased to be with you. __EOS__ And so far what have you found? What makes people happy? __EOS__ Well, first of all, economics tells us that the more we have, the better off we are. Essentially that economic development is the root to improving people's well being, and whether they have the goods and services they need for a good life. And the poorer economies, as you get richer we do get happier, we do report higher levels of well-being. But the evidence is quite strong that effect tails off. And actually, for the richest economies in the world, for every pound in the pocket extra you have, you get very little if any return in terms of well-being. That's the challenge. __EOS__ Hmm. Is this a province of government? Or isn't this classically a case of where people in their individual lives are free to make whatever decisions they can to figure out, for example, if there can be a tradeoff between making more money and spending more time with their family?

It was sort of an escapable, and it just kind of came out. __EOS__  Sitting on a bus, holding a across, wondering deep inside. Going through a field with some Alamo steel looking for a place to hide. She's setting out west but she can't confess that she's hoping that she can find a way to explain the cause of her pain and a shame that she left behind. Hoping someday she'll learn of their  and the people don't want her  under her skin.  runaway bride  on TV. She's counting the miles and forgetting for a while but she won't take the test to see.

52864," I think you know this one. __EOS__ A few weeks ago at the Harmony Festival in Santa Rosa, California, Ms. Lauryn Hill took the stage. Her band was restless and loud behind her, almost drowning her out. When she rapped, she spoke so fast it seemed she was barely breathing. She kept shouting directions to the band, but her voice was still strong and she was in complete control of her instrument. __EOS__  It could all be so simple. Come on. But you'd rather make it hard. Come on. Bring it on. Loving you is like a battle... __EOS__ I went to Harmony with little hope of landing an interview. I've been told not to touch her, not to look her in the eye, that instead of talking directly to people, she writes directions on a Post-it note and sticks it to your chest. ",2
52865," He's not mean. __EOS__ That's just a saying. __EOS__ Yeah. Jerry Lee Lewis, what's it like for you, I mean working with the young kids? I mean, I'm looking down the 18-track list, and you play with people like Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow and Shelby Lynne and, you know, some of the old folks, too, like Solomon Burke and Mick Jagger. Talk about recording with Mick Jagger, his and Keith Richards' tune ""Dead Flowers,"" where you duet with Jagger. __EOS__ It was a lot of fun listening and watching Mick do his bit, sing his song. It was thrilling. ",2
52866," I've been here 33 years. I came from Louisville, Kentucky, and I came for a job when they were going to put a woman on the six o'clock news and they got a twofer. An African-American and a woman. Until I came 33 years ago, there were no women or African-Americans doing the nightly news. We did noon, we did weekends, but the bread and butter shows, there were no women or African-Americans on. So I came for that, but I came also because of the AU Complex, where you had this center of activity in academia. It was exciting. You know, and you could see how this city was growing and how it was, even then 33 years ago, beginning to be international. __EOS__ International, right, because this is the home of DuBois. DuBois taught here and exciting things have happened in the city around the center. And the black community has always been aggressive about its position in the city. Certainly there are those who may characterize it differently, but overall I think you have to characterize it as one has been concerned and one has been a vital part of pushing the city forward. __EOS__ And you've got to remember too, and I'm sure you would agree with me, Dr. Boone, everyone knows Madame CJ Walker, but how many people know Dr. Alonzo Herndon who was the first millionaire, black millionaire, with a barbershop down on a white street? __EOS__ Right. ",3
52867," Yeah, David, so yeah, so you've got the grandmother here planting these little kisses on her sons throughout the film. What inspired that? __EOS__ I wanted just a kind of a small, but powerful, gesture that represented the almost proprietorial nature of the relationship that this woman has with her sons. You know, that in a way she appears very loving, but actually, her relationship with her children is very self-serving. You know, that what she really loves the idea of being at the center of a pack of quite young and powerful and dangerous men, being her sons. And that's the level in which her love seems to operate. And so I kind of just liked that small and proprietary gesture. __EOS__ I don't know mothers who sit on their sons' laps. __EOS__ You know, this is a film about kind of the daily life of criminals, David Michod, and it's a pretty on glamorized view of their lives. Were there any, kind of, crime movies stereotypes you wanted to avoid? ",1

Dick - but they say well, he's not really a science fiction writer because science fiction is often obsessed with the advancement of technology and the effects of technology, that Philip Dick was much more interested in the human condition than in technology. They may be right, but a lot of science fiction is like that if you actually read it. __EOS__ Right. Well, you know, this gets into definitions and one of the funny things about literary definitions is that people will almost always argue that something they admire isn't part of a genre. __EOS__ Right.

If you'd like to join our conversation or tell us a story about your own experiences in Chinatown, give us a call. The number is 800-989-8255. And you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. __EOS__ Hi. Thank you so much for taking my call. In Fresno, California, we have somewhat of a small Chinatown that had a long history here, namely with the underground passages and the opium dens, that type of prohibition area. But now, unfortunately, from what I've seen, it's sort of slipping into more of a ghost town. I was wondering if your guest knows any other cities that have experienced their Chinatown somewhat slipping into that type of ghost town-esque era but experienced resurgence maybe how they accomplished that. __EOS__ You know, that's a really good question. I'm not entirely sure of the answer to that. But what I do know is that there area a lot of communities like the ones that you mentioned. And we can go back to the Gold Rush era to address that, which is that all of these communities spread out all over California and they could all be called Chinatowns because the Chinese were there building the railroad, doing a lot agriculture work. And that history, unfortunately, has sort of faded away and been forgotten in many places because once the jobs dried up, they would move to the cities. And once the jobs dried up and they still felt a lot of racism locally, especially in the smaller communities, they went to the bigger cities  San Francisco, New York, L.A., as we mentioned, to find the security, the jobs, the place to live. And they were actually forced back to the big cities. I think, by the 1920, you know, 60 percent of the Chinese were in these urban centers. __EOS__ All right. Thanks so much for your call, Tai.

52871," I promise not to repeat things other people say.  __EOS__ The Steve Martin whose demented physical comedy made him a huge star walked away from stand-up in 1981 at the height of his fame. In the beginning there was a string of small, quirky stages, like the drive-in movie theater, where the audience honked at the punch lines. In the end, there were giant arenas and a life suffused, as he puts it, with a freakish celebrity aura. In fact, Steve Martin calls his book a biography of a guy he used to know, one he views now with surprising warmth.  __EOS__ Hi. How are you? __EOS__ Fine, thanks. How are you doing? ",3
52872," If you're just joining us, my guests are Morgan Neville, who directed the new documentary about backup singers called ""20 Feet from Stardom,"" and Merry Clayton, a backup singer who was prominently featured in the movie.__EOS__ You know, on the one hand the best part is something that the Waters told me. The Waters are kind of a legendary family of backup singers that have sung on everything for 50 years, and they said, you know, look, we're not stars but, you know, we've sung behind people that have a hit, and they have a three-year career or a five-year career and they disappear.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ And we have nice houses; we've raised families, and we've been doing this for 50 years, and we're getting paid to do what we love. You know, and I think if you're of that mentality, that's a pretty great thing.",2
52873," We mentioned some of the esteemed names that you played with over the years. What's that like for you, to be standing next to someone that you idolized at one point? __EOS__ Well, it's very gratifying and very humbling at the same time. I was very fortunate that when I came on the scene I would always usually be the youngest person in these ensembles, working with people like Candido, the great Cuban congero, Tito Puente, Mario Bauza, Chico O'Farrell, et cetera, some of the other people that you mentioned. __EOS__ You don't think some of the younger players coming up respect the music of where it came from or who made it? __EOS__ If you talk to younger players, their historical knowledge of the music usually ends with the Miles Davis Quintet. And they don't go any farther than that. The things of the past are being relegated to the past. And my thing has always been don't just remember the past but honor it. And I'm very much about that. I mean, we have a piece of music that was, I believe, written in 1928, Buddy Johnson's classic, ""Since I Fell For You."" ",2

As we'll hear later, Letterman is one of Kimmel's idols, and Kimmel paid tribute to him when Letterman received a Kennedy Center honor last December.__EOS__30 compared to 12 30, and, you know, what does that mean to you?__EOS__ I like that you put it that way because I think the symbolism is probably more important because of Johnny Carson and because of ""The Tonight Show"" being on at 11 30. And so it's a big deal for me, it is. I mean, it's something that as a kid I was very interested in, and it's like being a baseball fan all your life and getting to be an announcer.__EOS__ How old were you when you were allowed to stay up to 11 30 and watch ""The Tonight Show""?",3

You come here occasionally on tour, but I think it's mostly people who follow avant garde jazz who really know your work.

52876," I understand, Dr. Hawass, that when this technology was first made available to you, you were a little skeptical about how useful it might be. __EOS__ You know, because I always thought that you don't have any DNA lab of ancient mummies. All the DNA labs are not made for mummies. And that's why there is lots of mistakes that can happen. I was, again, scared at the beginning, and they always see that many non-scientific people who really made the speculation of mummies. __EOS__ Everett, thanks very much for the call. __EOS__ Thanks.

We're going to take a short break and come back and talk lots more with Dava Sobel, who is the author of The Planets. She's going to talk about why she's used some of her artistic knowledge, like talking about astrology when we're talking about the chapter on Jupiter. So it's interesting stuff.

52878," Hi, Mike. __EOS__ Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my call. __EOS__ Sure. __EOS__ I just want - your guest had mentioned the morality, or at least touched on it without going into much explanation of that. But in regards to the subject of morality and economics, especially with the subject of the issue of a living wage, where's the value of a person's labors in such a - subject of a free - with regards to freedom? Isn't that how we got rid of slaveries, that the lowest bevel society wouldn't just keep on supporting the richer levels of society and the corporations? ",0
52879," In all the chaos, a home video camera captures only a few, brief moments of the brawl. __EOS__ There are people who are picking up chairs in this bowling alley and smashing them down on people. It's an ugly-looking fight. __EOS__ It is an ugly-looking fight, yes. As to what precipitated it, Allen Iverson and three of his black friends said that this white bowler, named Steve Forrest, called Allen the N-word. Of course, Steve Forrest - who's passed away now, so I couldnt speak to him - he said at the trial that Allen Iverson really was the one that started the fight. He was minding his own business, and Allen came over and provoked him. __EOS__ And you show some footage from the courtroom as Iverson is sentenced to a total of 15 years for this brawl - in which, although it was ugly, no one was that seriously injured. Is that correct? ",3
52880,"  I believe you, Mr. Hanning. I believe that you believe, that you believe you told me one thing. But sir, with all due respect and gratitude for you and the service you gave to this country, you didn't tell me that thing. You told me something else. I wrote what Mr. Hanning told me. __EOS__ And that's Tom McCarthy, our guest, in a scene from the fifth season of ""The Wire,"" where he plays a reporter who stretches the bounds of ethics, shall we say, at the Baltimore Sun. __EOS__ Absolutely. People are really vocal about that. That show has a very - you know, just walking through your offices here, which feel a little bit like a newsroom, I start to get that itchy feeling that someone's going to launch a stapler at me or something. __EOS__ You're a bad man. ",1
52881,"  Does Miers' withdrawal end this episode in your mind, or are      there much larger problems here that Republicans and the White House will      have to wrestle with? __EOS__  Let's hope, first of all, the president comes up with a better      nominee second time.  I think this episode has revealed some real      weaknesses in the White House staff process, and, clearly this nomination      was not checked thoroughly.  Clearly, a lot of people acted in impulsive      ways that are kind of alarming.  So I think that there are some internal      reforms there that are going to be necessary; I'm sure they'll happen. __EOS__  As somebody who worked in the White House and who knows many      people there, do you think that people in the White House have been      distracted in recent weeks by this investigation on which we're expecting      the possibility of indictments in the coming days? __EOS__  That's certainly possible.  On the other hand, the people who      work on judicial nominations are different people from the people who      might be distracted.  And so I think they now need to reorganize      themselves, but I think this is a good day for conservatives, it's a good      day for the president; it's a good day for the country.  You know,      sometimes we have Democratic presidents and sometimes Republican, but      both owe America the best from their side, and when there's a Democratic      president he should pick the best Democrat he can find, and a Republican      president owes the country the same thing.

52882," So, Ron, let's talk two things there is substance and then there is tone. And Congressman Ryan like frankly a number of people in leadership positions in the Republican Party - I'm not just talk about the national level talking about the state and local level - have often been criticized for speaking about poverty in a way that is racially coded and offensive. So that this fix that? Does this meet the smell test, in your view, for somebody who is really wanting to open up a conversation?__EOS__ Yes. I mean, I've known Paul Ryan for almost 25 years and this is nothing new from his trying to find a way to deliver much-needed services to those who are most at risk in the safety net, while at the same time, ensuring that the states are the best laboratories and the best people to dispense these services to people who need them. I was with the chairman yesterday when he made this announcement and one of the things, picking up on Corey's point, is that this is not just a lump-sum block grant to the states, this is a volunteer program. So a state has to decide, do I want to participate - yes or no. If I decide I to want to participate here's how am going to structure my plan. They would submit their plan to the federal government then HHS and the delivery system would say, OK we're going to take the California approach. So the notion that this is some of one size fits all block grant isn't true.__EOS__ Tell me how the rest of the Republican caucuses is responding to this. What are you hearing so far? I understand this is very new, but what are you hearing?__EOS__ I'm hearing very positive thing. And have to be perfectly honest with you, looking at what Paul Ryan has done, looking at what Rand Paul is talking about - this is not your old white guy Republican Party anymore. I think the younger leaders in the Republican Party recognize that in order to expand our base we need to do what is the simplest thing in politics - politics is about addition not subtraction. We need to find ways to appeal to people of color, we need to find ways to appeal to people who are of a different socioeconomic backgrounds and we need to ask if I'd a way to get rid of the social issues these stigmas that have really traumatized us the last couple of cycles. So good for them, that's what I'm hearing on the hill. People are very, very encouraged by this.",3
52883," Awesome. __EOS__ What is it called again? __EOS__ I'm sorry? __EOS__ It's called what, again? I'm sorry. ",0
52884," Hum. And that certainly comes across in Hilly Kristal. He just sort of is who he is.__EOS__ Yeah. It's what makes him kind of heroic, I think.__EOS__ He's comfortable in his skin.__EOS__ Comfortable in his skin and rigorous about saying to the groups that he never expected to be supporting, OK, you can come and play here but only original music, no covers. That's a brave thing to say at that time. And that puts him in the forefront of being a kind of revolutionary.",1
52885," ...because no matter you look like you could still keep working.__EOS__ Yeah. Well, I always had a weak chin because we couldn't afford to correct my bite, you know, and - which could have been corrected with braces. And so the chin was always, always weak and I always was kind of hated my profile. And I thought wouldn't it be nice one day to feel the rain on your chin without having to look up, you know.__EOS__ And my daughter Jody had the opposite problem, she had an underbite. And so we went to this oral surgeon and he said he could fix her. And then he looked at me and he said, you know, I could fix your bite too. I said, really? So he showed me on some imaging how he could extend my bite like three millimeters out and I would just have kind of a normal chin. I said well, let's go for it. So he did and so I got a chin.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.",3
52886," Wow. __EOS__ The singers, the background, everything, orchestra. __EOS__ So what impact did this song have on your career? __EOS__ It brought me to the forefront. It was a big record, so I think people just - and to this day love that record. In fact, its in the Narris Hall of Fame - that, my record. I'm very proud of that. People just loved it. You know, they loved the record. They loved the song, they loved the vocal, they loved the arrangement, everything. ",2
52887," Very well.__EOS__ Faster than they thought you would, but still you were laying there in that bed for weeks.__EOS__ That does not feel good. So my goal was, I'm coming back to fight.__EOS__ Tell us what that first fight was like after the surgery.",0
52888," Well I have, first of all, I'm not a reporter so I have no First Amendment protections, and so I have to be very, very careful. I have to self-censor because, you know, obviously it goes without saying that the worst thing that could possibly happen to me is to get a knock on the door and a pair of FBI agents are standing there in the doorway. So I tried to be very careful. I kept a lot of material out of the book that dealt with ongoing operations, particularly those of a technical nature - which, you know, if I was to say or write anything about them, you know, could cause harm to national security.__EOS__ But it was OK to describe where these FBI aircraft are? I mean did you talk to them about it?__EOS__ No. Actually, I talked to some people in the intelligence community about the whole issue and they said, look, if you can find this hangar - and, by the way, if you knew where to look, the information is available on Google. It's - you just have to know where to look. I mean I'm not claiming that, you know, this was any massive discovery on my part; it's just, you know, all the various bits of data were out there, you just had to know where to find it. And I'm sure the FBI will not be happy with me about this, but I didn't disclose a lot of information about the activities of these aircraft or the identities of the companies involved. That may have gone, you know, crossed the line and I just didn't want to go there.__EOS__ Well, Matthew Aid, it's been really interesting. Thanks so much for speaking with us.",0
52889," Wow.__EOS__ ...Because at 18,000 miles an hour, you can get to pretty where - anywhere on earth in about 40 minutes. But equally, I think that through space travel, we may well be able to reduce the carbon footprint to a negligible carbon footprint in traveling people around the world by, you know, getting them out of the Earth's atmosphere and orbitally around the world - anyway, all Virgin flights. We'll see whether the others catches up.__EOS__ So we're - I mean, so this is really, probably going to be the next big innovation in flight, right? Like, now we've got - I've seen jet travel, and the Concorde was around for a while. But it's more or less the same amount of time to get from New York to Tokyo. But the big change is going to be when you've got aircraft that will launch into space and then come back down.__EOS__ Yes. I mean, that's going to be the radical change. And then it's up to our engineers and technicians to overcome the technological challenge, then to make sure that it is environmentally safe.",3

I don't think we've even seen the tip of the iceberg. __EOS__ Hmm. Well, Governor Perry, thanks a lot for talking with us. __EOS__ Oh, thank you. ",3
52902," The human stomach, the stomach goes to great lengths not to burst because the stomach resides inside a creature that really, really loves to eat and frequently overeat. So it needs to be able to take emergency measures if its owner is eating to excess. And one of the simplest things your stomach can do to relieve pressure is something called the transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, which means burp. That's what that is. That's a burp. But that's the medical term.__EOS__ What does the bicarbonate do?__EOS__ It produces gas. It hits the stomach and it - there's a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction happens and it produces gas. And the idea is you want to be able to burp, and it makes you burp, and you feel better because burping is a release of gas. So a little bit is good; a lot not so good.__EOS__ I can't comprehend competitive eating.",0
52903," I love records. I love albums. I like listening to the entirety of something. But hopefully, you know, I would hope that each individual piece might reveal something touching and holistic in its own way and say OK, that is the Fellowship Band, you know.__EOS__ Makes me want to take a road trip.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ Crossing that line.",2
52904," So you can treat individual symptoms. And you hear sometimes people say, well, you know, the symptoms are there for a reason. That's your body fighting the infection. And if you treat the symptoms, you might actually be prolonging the duration of the cold. Is that true? __EOS__ Not from what I understand from the experts. The advice that I heed is advocated by Jack Gwaltney, who studied the common cold for 40 years, and he's arguably one of the world's foremost experts. __EOS__ Well, Jennifer Ackerman, thanks so much for speaking with us. __EOS__ Thank you, it was a pleasure.

52906," I know. It's kind of interesting. But what I never really thought of, you look at shots of the crowd and you see just a gigantic crowd. And the crowd is kind of this character. But the idea of individual stories and individual people making up that crowd, I didn't think of that usually when I though of Woodstock. __EOS__ I read a line from your standup routine. And this is the line, you say, I used to get bummed out when it rained. But then I realized it's just God's way of washing hippies. __EOS__ I don't know. I guess saying hippies in that joke would definitely put it in Venn diagram that overlaps with Woodstock. But I was probably thinking more about specific situations when I've been on the road and ended up somewhere, and there's somebody who smells like patchouli or something like that. And I think... __EOS__ ...well, that's an association I have - olfactory, I guess, association with Woodstock. ",1
52907,"  Some of that rock and roll wasn't too bad. But I think Gordon tells a familiar story, and when he refers to Ledbetter of course, Huddie Leadbetter, also known as Lead Belly. __EOS__  Yeah. __EOS__  Right. I mean Moe not only did he put the records out, but he kept them in print. And what that meant was that Woody Guthrie for example, who Moe recorded extensively in the 40s and early 50s was unable to perform. He was beginning to suffer from the first stages of Huntington's chorea, the terrible disease that took his life. But Moe kept those records in print. And so, that really Woody Guthrie wouldn't have been heard if it weren't for Moe and a young man in Hibbing, Minnesota named Bob Dylan wouldn't have been influenced to come to New York to find him. So, and also when you looked in the actual archives and see the royalty statements, it's not like these records were selling thousands of copies. I think Woody Guthrie's initial albums sold in the tens. And so it just simply was Moe's feeling that this music deserved to be heard even if it was unpopular. Certainly the same thing was true for Pete Seeger who as black listed. __EOS__  You know, fascinating connection that of course Huddie Ledbetter song ""Goodnight Irene"" became a number one hit for the Weavers including Pete Seeger six months after Huddie Ledbetter's death and then of course that group had to breakup under the influence of the Red Scares.

Isn't reality      television in a way an effort to get to the authentic stories of com... __EOS__  Come on, Neal.  How oxymoronic do we need to get with      reality television?  You know, it's--I don't even want to go there.  It's      not reality. I guess it is television, but it's not reality. ",0
52909," No, I think that I must have assumed that because the other thing I enjoyed about this was how little there was in the prologue. I met with him, I liked his film, ""Margin Call."" That was the only other film he had made. I liked that a lot. I liked the script that he had written for this because it was so exact. It was so detail-oriented, and it told me that there was a vision behind this film that was very secure.__EOS__ Give us a sense of some of the things that you had to endure, like when you're in the storm, in one of the storms, and, you know, you're being rained on. What are you experiencing - how are you protecting yourself?__EOS__ Well, it was a real - first of all it was a real storm because the - yes, as you said, a lot of it was on the open water. But when we had to get into the really tough stuff, we went into a giant tank where they have these big wave machines, these big cylinders that can cork up the waves to six, seven feet, that will swamp the boat and maybe turn it over. You had rain, violent rain machines; then you had wind machines.__EOS__ You know, I read that during some of the filming, because of all the water that was attacking you, you got an ear infection and I think temporarily lost hearing, 60 percent of your hearing in one ear. Is that accurate?",3
52910," Right. Right. But I think because I moved to the tenor saxophone and I focused on the tenor saxophone for so many years, then I went back to the clarinet. I said  Why not apply those techniques into the clarinet, the ones that I learned to play on the saxophone?__EOS__ Now, what about in the upper register? What do you think about there?__EOS__ Well, the upper register of the clarinet can be quite painful. So...__EOS__ Painful as in squeaky?",2
52911," We love...we are very keen on words. I mean, one of my fav...__EOS__ They need Saddam Hussein's shoemaker.__EOS__ There's a wonderful one  gongoozler - very useful word - one who stares for a long time at things happening on a canal.__EOS__ We run into that all the time, don't we? To bring a little local interest to this, only half of the people who reached America on the Mayflower in 1620 survived to the spring of 1621. That is utterly sobering.",0
52912," Can you talk a little bit about those final scenes in ""Apocalypse Now""? I assume most of you have seen ""Apocalypse Now"" in the room.__EOS__ So this won't be a spoiler. The scenes with Brando, I understand he came to The Philippines not having prepared.__EOS__ Brando, the deal with Brando was three weeks for $3 million. But he had promised me that he was going to be a little thinner than he was when I last saw him in L.A. because, you know, the issue was, if he was a runaway Green Beret officer, it sounds silly, but what kind of uniform should he wear? They don't make size XXXXX Green Beret uniform, you know.__EOS__ So when he showed up on the location where we were, he was much bigger than he had been even when he said he would lose weight, and I was just thinking probably what kind of uniform should I get for him, you know.",1
52913," Yeah. That's kind of the endgame for this movie. You have the dolphin as a, you know, the only wild animal throughout history to save the life of a human being. You know, from the time of Aristotle and Pliny, these animals are legendary for saving the lives of sailors. The only way we could save their life now is to prove that we've made their environment so toxic that we shouldn't be eating them. It's, you know, we've lost respect for them and the environment that they come from. __EOS__ Let's get another caller on the conversation. This is Marcy. Marcy calling from San Rafael in California. __EOS__ Hi. Thank you for taking my call. I want to say first, that was one of the most shocking, saddest films we've probably seen ever. And thank you for making the film. __EOS__ Marcy, you're supposed to say the first 80 minutes of the film were a laugh riot. ",1
52914," …but we both studied the time period. Paula, would you like to comment? __EOS__ Right. And certainly, Mengele was fascinated by twins and did conduct obviously monstrous, twin studies, which were, you know, were far more horrific than anything we've experienced. But certainly - along the same lines and the fact that we are both Jewish and twins - you know, no doubt, we would have been of great interest to Dr. Mengele. And it is kind of horrifying to think that even after World War II that a Jewish agency like this in particular would not have, you know, looked to the past and really questioned the ethics of conducting such a study. __EOS__ We actually came face-to-face - we interview with Dr. Peter Neubauer, who was the impetus behind the study. And even today, he's a sprightly 93 and he expresses no remorse about the study that he conducted. And, you know, he seemed to express regrets simply about that he couldn't publish the results of his study of which he seemed to be so proud. __EOS__ Hmm. We want to give listeners an opportunity to speak with Elyse Schein and Paula Bernstein. And why don't we start with - this is going to be Gina. Gina is with us from Levering in Michigan. ",0
52915," Hmm. Is that your experience at all? __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ I understand what Josh is saying, and I think that's what many people's reaction is that they see the authoritarian side of math. And you often hear it said, there's a right and a wrong answer, and math is great because of that, or  but for some people it's  that's its worst aspect that... __EOS__ Right. ",0
52916," Yeah. Well, thank you.__EOS__ Thanks, Christy. OK.__EOS__ Thank you.__EOS__ We're talking today with Judy Blume, the author - what's your most recent book?",0
52917," I know a couple of them, and they went to the punk rock bar with me. You should have seen people's expressions when I walked in with them. And they knew it wasn't a Halloween costume. __EOS__ So, you... __EOS__ It's hard to be into sadism at the beach. I mean, I don't know. It just seems to negate that. __EOS__ So have you actually seen, like, bikers and gay S&M men shopping in the same store? ",1
52918," Mrs. Stockton left, I'm trying to remember why. __EOS__ She had a maternity leave. __EOS__ That's right, yes. __EOS__ And I should add to what Matilda's saying there, that what she's not saying is the norm at the school was corporal punishment. I had never experienced corporal punishment and couldn't bring myself to do it and therefore I lost complete control of my students. And  back and thinking about this experience to understand why it was so important for these children to learn how to obey immediately, because in the Jim Crow South they were in danger, they were vulnerable if they didn't appreciate authority and immediately obey it. I of course was trying to teach them to question authority, which was not the correct thing to be doing at that moment in time. ",0

52920," Is that what we're doing when we're scratching - inducing pain to relieve the itch?__EOS__ It's interesting. I think there are two aspects to it. Yes, there is a bit component of pain but there is also - and that's unique, I think, to itch - is that there is a component of pleasure and scratching an itch. We find it relieving, but there is something in addition. Our studies and other groups' may suggest that there is a - also a brain mechanism involved in pleasure of scratching an itch and they are involving in this repetitive behavior, so it's bit addictive to start scratching.__EOS__ But, I thought if you keep scratching an itch - because of the itch-scratch syndrome, is that what it's called?__EOS__ Cycle.",3

It's what's called a work lead, a lead that the singer would put on as the tracking musicians - in this case, the bass and drummer - the bass and then the drummer could hear how it - rather than just look at a chart with chord changes and all, you could hear how the melody goes. And then it would be replaced with a master lead at - well, at a future date. But Karen sang these things so well that, you know - the scratch lead works just dandy. __EOS__ And she does.

52922," During stressful times in American life, many of us look back on our history for comfort or guidance. So it may be no surprise that an upcoming book by Chris Matthews, the MSNBC television host, is a biography of President John F. Kennedy. Earlier this year on MORNING EDITION, Robert Redford discussed his movie about the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. __EOS__ Thank you, Steve. I appreciate you having me in.  __EOS__ What draws you to Lincoln and to that particular moment?  __EOS__ Well, I'm very concerned about leadership in America right now, and this isn't a knock on any specific elected official, but I think that we are lacking leadership. And in my opinion - I'm a former history teacher, I got a history degree from Marist College - President Abraham Lincoln was our best leader, for a variety of reasons.  ",0
52923," No.__EOS__ No.__EOS__ Unfortunately, no.__EOS__ These students are serious about movies. But a lot of them sided with 20-year-old Mike Minahan, who said when it comes to ""Gone With The Wind,"" frankly, he doesn't give a damn.",1

52925," So how did it get to the point where you did so much drugs that you ended up not working? __EOS__ Well, I mean, there comes a point where, like, you know, if you're not the most popular guy in the world and in demand, suddenly people start looking at your behavior and then not wanting to work with you. __EOS__ I get the impression that you've been working really manically since you've been straight. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. I would have worked manically all my life if I would have been allowed to. ",1
52926," I wouldn't use the word satisfied. I feel like sometimes it's a situation of two steps forward and three steps back, you know. Right now, the violence is not as bad as it's ever been because many of those villages and those people are gone or they're living in the outskirts in Chad and the mountains around the area. So they're not there anymore. But we still have the Janjaweed there. There're still government sanctioned attacks that are happening to the people there because the international community has not done anything to prevent it.__EOS__ We call these conversations Wisdom Watch, where we ask people to reflect and maybe - you know, people who are at a point in their life where they can reflect, you know, and sort of think back. Is there any wisdom you'd pass on, perhaps, to somebody just starting out or somebody listening to our conversation who would like to do what you do?__EOS__ You know, people come up to me and they ask me what can they do to get started all of the time, and I really feel like it's such a letdown because it's hard for me to give advice because I started, you know, almost 27 - 28 years ago now, and the business has changed so much. You look at television nowadays and you see guest stars that have had film careers. They're like me, leads in television shows that, you know, are film actors.__EOS__ You have a very successful family life, as well, and that's something that people don't always associate with Hollywood. And so - well, not just Hollywood, but let's just be honest about it, it seems like families are under a lot of stress in this country right now.",1
52927," Well, I think the first thing is that he's defined success down, or to be more charitable, he's set more realistic goals. He's really not focused on fully transforming the country. He's talking about containing and defeating al-Qaida. I think that what he's buying into is a very long commitment in Afghanistan just to keep a lid on things. And I think the most troublesome part of this, which would exist with or without the new plan, is that developments of Pakistan are very alarming - worrying that border between Pakistan and Afghanistan is essentially an artificial border, nobody there really recognizes it. And so, I think that he, whatever chance of success they have in Afghanistan will also depend on Pakistan not blowing up on them. __EOS__ Notably this was the strategy announced regarding Afghanistan and Pakistan. __EOS__ Right. Most of the safe heavens are over in Pakistan. I think that's the weakest part of the Obama plan - the idea that we are going to sort of seduce the Pakistanis into actually enforcing those borders and cracking down the terrorists, that's a pipe dream. The one area do I disagree  this is nation building to the max. We're going to go valley by valley, village by village, trying to change that country. __EOS__ David Brooks of the New York Times, E.J. Dionne of the Washington Post, thanks to both of you. ",3
52928," He is such a startling sort of revolutionary figure in American music and music around the world. It's funny. I feel like 70 is a totally meaningless number in relationship to him, because I'm sure the creativity will continue until he's 150. __EOS__ As Steve Reich enters his eighth decade, he's doing anything but slowing down. He's written three pieces that will have New York premiers next to older work at all three institutions. Lincoln Center is premiering You Are Variations. __EOS__ Steve Reich writes his music in a language that's accessible for most listeners, but he's constantly pushing boundaries and using new technology. In the 1960s, he experimented with tape loops. __EOS__ And in 1988, he wrote Different Trains for the Kronos Quartet, which utilized the latest digital technology to incorporate recorded voices of Holocaust survivors with instruments. ",2
52929," Thank you.  __EOS__ A few comments of the writer resonated with me. I'm a Caribbean-American. I did not grow up - I wouldn't say I grew up impoverished. I didn't grow up in a black slum or a deeply black-rooted neighborhood, but my family wasn't well off. My dad was a self-employed carpenter. I mean, we were on - we had to go to the food bank every once in awhile to get food. But what resonated with me was that - the parents that pushed, and my parents were very pushing parents.  __EOS__ Congratulations. __EOS__ And it's really just because I have parents that were able to push me. ",0
52930,"  Yeah.  Great profession.  And... __EOS__  Thank you. __EOS__  ...yes, I've seen differences--big differences in family      societies, in traditional tribal cultures like New Guinea and in the      West, just as some starters.  In New Guinea highland society, children      are independent much earlier than here in the West.  I remember on my      first trip to New Guinea in 1964, going through a village, I was looking      for carriers. There was a nine-year-old boy who volunteered.  He went      off, didn't ask his parents for permission.  Returned about a month later      and I asked, `Will your parents get worried?'  He said, `No.  Somebody      will tell them that I went off and I got this job.'  So independence of      children. __EOS__  What about the role of the transgenerational passing down of      approaches to seeing--you know, like you can see the collapse coming but      if you have inherited this cultural blindness or approaches to violence.      Do you see differences there? ",0
52931," It was this real kind of Army moment. Yeah.__EOS__ Louis C.K., speaking with Terry Gross. The new  season of his FX series ""Louie"" begins Thursday. Here's an excerpt from his comedy special, ""Live at the Beacon Theater,"" which was first available exclusively on his website and has since been shown on FX. He's talking here about his recent success has allowed him to fly first class, so he gets to board first and watch tired and frustrated passengers slowly board and take their less comfortable seats in coach.__EOS__ I see soldiers fly all the time because that's how they get to the war. You think they get to go in a cool green plane with a red light - go, go, go. No, they just go to Delta, and they just wait in line to go to a war.__EOS__ You know what? I should give him my seat. It would be the right thing to do. It would be easy to do, and it would mean a lot to him. I could go up to him  Hey son - I get to call him son. Hey son, go ahead and take my seat.",3
52932," Right. Well, I mean, I think that goes back to what I said earlier about, you know, it's my chance to do one of those movies, you know, in a context that sort of made sense for me because I really love those kinds of movies. And so it was really fun to have the opportunity to do that and to figure out what that process is and to get to work -first of all, safety-wise, you just have to work with the best people, and that's the most important thing. And we did and, you know, so that was what it was. __EOS__ Why? __EOS__ Because a movie set is such a weird, amorphous place where it's just people standing around. You realize, there's no - there's where the camera is, there's some lights, but then after that, it's trailers, they could be anywhere. There's a craft service table where people get food, and that's it. So it's, like, it was actually harder to sort of navigate that cinematically and figure out how to film that because it just looks like an amorphous blob, and that ended up being a much more stressful few days than all the other stuff which we got to plan out and do storyboards on and was very, you know, much more sort of movie-like. __EOS__ You have really big muscles in this movie. When did you start working out and get those, like, really big muscles? ",1
52933," Yeah. Why should we care, I guess is the question. So one reason that you might want to care is just to say well, someone who is on the bread line, they could use the dollar much more than someone who is a millionaire.__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ And I think that's pretty intuitive. Whether inequality really damages a country as a whole is less clear. I think the main argument that it's a problem is that it starts to corrode your political system. As you get fewer and fewer people with more and more money who were able to have a disproportionate influence on political priorities through their campaigning, their lobbying, they're political donations. And if that happens, then you're moving further and further away from the ideals of a democracy.__EOS__ One thing that you wrote about that really struck me. You said that people who are looking for a job when an economy is not doing well, there can be a lasting impact on that person for many years in their career and in their life. What do you mean by that?",0
52934,"  And seeing the response that it got from people made me      think, `OK, you know what?  Maybe I can pull it off and do it for      myself.' __EOS__  Cumbia, anybody can reach out, regardless of what kind of      music you're in to. __EOS__  I'm Mexican and I'm from Texas, and it's sort of like the      national group of Mexico and Texas.  The thing that I always like to      focus on is the guiro, you know, it's like the chi chi-cha chi-cha-chich,      you know, like the little wood block.  And they call that gavaito,      which means little horse.  So if you can imagine, like, a little horse,      you know, like prancing along. __EOS__  Every once in a while, I'll hear a song and it will just take      me someplace.  And it's like a small, like--it's like a little deja vu. ",2
52935,"  Gets him - it gets him down...__EOS__ Well, Bob Mould ,it's been a lot of fun of talking you, really appreciate it.__EOS__ Great. Thank you, David.__EOS__ That's Bob Mould. His new album came out yesterday. This is NPR News. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",2
52936," Hi, Neal. Hi, Dolly.__EOS__ Hi.__EOS__ When I was 31, I started writing. It was my dream to write a novel. I would work on it an hour before work each morning. It got published  ""A Place Called Wiregrass,"" ""Slow Way Home,"" and ""Man in the Blue Moon."" And one day I got a letter from Dolly, and I just want to tell you how much that meant to me, and it's one of my most prized possessions. So thank you so much for encouraging me and so many other people to follow our dreams.__EOS__ Well, I love that - I've told you in the letter that I loved your books, and I did encourage you, and thank you for sending me the second one too. I just really think you're spectacular, and I - that's amazing that you called in today. So I'm proud of you. You're following your dream, and you're good at it too.",2
52937," And it's always been that way. __EOS__ Yes, in most of the operas, yeah, and I wouldn't change that. Mefistofele usually is sung by the bass. Think of other roles like Sweeney Todd. __EOS__   They all deserve to die. Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett, tell you why. Because in all of the whole human race, Mrs. Lovett, there are two kinds of men and only two. There's the one they put in his proper place and the one with his foot in the other one's face. Look at me, Mrs. Lovett, look at you. __EOS__ This is a truly demonic character. And Bryn Terfel, I understand you were in a production of ""Sweeney Todd"" a few years ago, and you actually performed this in front of the composer, Stephen Sondheim. How daunting was that? ",2
52938," As we've been saying, your film focuses on three voting rights marches that were intended to march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. But only the third succeeds in getting to Montgomery. That third march, President Johnson provides federal protection for the marchers. And by the third march, he's introduced the Voting Rights Act. You've been criticized by some people, including Joseph Califano, who worked in the Johnson administration, for making LBJ into something of a villain. And what Califano and several historians say is that, you know, LBJ was for the Voting Rights Act, but he knew he didn't have the votes to get it passed. So he couldn't really move forward until he knew it would actually get somewhere. And a couple of places have quoted a phone call between LBJ and Martin Luther King that was recorded. So I'm just going to read a quote from that. So Martin Luther King has been saying to the president that, you know, if black people actually get the right to vote in the South, it will be great for Democrats 'cause black people will go to the polls, and they will vote for Democrats.__EOS__ Well, the first point you had said is that people see LBJ as a - that I painted him as a villain, which is not what I was trying to do. If I wanted to paint someone as a villain, particularly LBJ, there's a lot I could do in that regard. I did not have that intention. People cheer for LBJ in the film. He makes a triumphant we shall overcome speech at the end that gets some of the most applause in this film that we've taken around the country at this point. And that's what it was intended to do. So he's not villain-ized - getting a lot of really hate-filled tweets from people saying, you villain-ized him. I was like, have you seen the film? Not yet. OK, well, why don't you check out the film? So I think, you know, in terms of the conversation you read, to me, it's Johnson outlining King's strategy that was already in play. The SCLC strategy, the SNCC strategy - I mean, in the very op-ed that you speak of, Joseph Califano actually writes the words that Selma was LBJ's idea and cites that very phone call that you just read, which is absurd because we know that the black citizens on the ground, that Amelia Boynton, who was a citizen of Selma who had been working around this since the 1930s - the voting rights - with her husband in that county, in Lowndes County, was the very one who invited Dr. King to Selma to illustrate these ills. We know that the whole idea of amplifying and illustrating, you know, a racial oppression was the whole - the whole modus operandi of SCLC and SNCC and CORE for years before this call was made. So the idea that he wasn't simply outlining what was already being done and kind of cosigning on that - but the idea that that call demonstrates that it was he is idea is a head-scratcher. But beyond that, you know, our intention was not to say anything other than these were two great minds who were in a chess match at times. It wasn't a skip through the park that they came to this Voting Rights Act. I mean, the very fact that these citizens had to walk and march twice unprotected, unassisted, to face state troopers with no federal aid - that was a big point of contention. Yes, the president did come on board eventually. Yes, he did eventually order the federal protection. Yes, he did pass the Voting Rights Act. Yes, there were nuances and challenges to - as far as what was happening in Washington that made him have to take pause and kind of play a tactical game with timing. But the bottom line is this is what we show in the film. It was a timing issue. And King was always saying the time is now. The time is not to wait. And that's all we do in the film. I mean, I think this has all been a bit overblown, especially because this film is not about LBJ. This is a film that's about the people of Selma and the black leadership of Selma and the allies who came to the aid of black people who were being terrorized in Selma. And one of those allies turned out to be, eventually, LBJ.__EOS__ My guest is Ava DuVernay. She directed the new film, ""Selma."" Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're talking about the new film ""Selma,"" which is directed by my guest, Ava DuVernay.",1
52939," Mm.__EOS__ So I think we really need to think about that kind of stuff when we're talking about admissions and looking at populations.__EOS__ Po, anything you want to add to that?__EOS__ Yeah. Well, Ashley's calling attention to a performance in these standardized tests. On the SAT, it bothers me that the same test is used for Harvard applicants as is used for California state college applicants. You know, on the math section there's 54 questions. Maybe 30 of those are needed to help determine whether a kid meets the sufficient baseline to go to a Cal State College. The other 24 questions are really not for those kids. They're there to sort out all those people trying to go to the Ivy Leagues to see who is best on those. But to the kid who's just trying to get into Cal State, they are going to see those really tough questions on a test and have no idea how to solve them and that makes it much more difficult for them.",0
52940,"  I don't think I have worms. This is just how I am. __EOS__ That was Brad Pitt, in case you didn't recognize that voice. __EOS__ Brad Pitt as a very little boy, which is weird because he's aging backwards there. So when he was a small child, he had a very old face. And in order to create that, they took another person's body and they superimposed Brad Pitt's features on this other person so that you're dealing with two sets of body English, kind of, and two sets of features, and it's all blended digitally. And that was a case, I mean, Brad Pitt was nominated for an Oscar. And... __EOS__ Deservingly so, in your estimation? ",1
52941," Yes, sir. Because many of these country that is being colonized by the British or the Western... __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ ...and the education system is based on the Western system. So like in Islam, there is education . But in this coast, they don't have that. So some of the people that opposed some of these students from going to school is not because they don't want them to go to school, but because it's about - because of your religion. It's a way of life. It's not just a religion. And she says, you can't say something like democracy is Islam. It is not. Democracy is the will of the people. Islam is fully submission to the will of Allah. So it's not the same thing. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. ",0
52942," You don't at all.__EOS__ OK.__EOS__ Let's listen a little bit of this album. There's a song on here, ""Philosophize In It, Chemicalize With It.""__EOS__  Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. And if you fly into the sky, and if your body is a penny and dime, ready to throw it in the fountain of my many monies. And if you push it I will take you offline. Philosophize in it. Chemicalize with it...",2
52943," Yeah, we're real dumb. New Orleans has been where it is for almost 300 years. It was put here for a very good reason  It's the best place for a port, at the end of a giant river that drains two-thirds of the country that provides the commerce for two-thirds of the country. __EOS__ Every river delta port city in the world is built at or below sea level. It's just  and one other point. Many of the places that were flooded during New Orleans were 10, 12 feet above sea level, but when an 18-foot wall of water from a badly constructed floodwall comes at you, that didn't help. __EOS__ And I don't mean to point fingers, Brian, but Milford, Delaware, may be  the highest point might be nine feet above sea level. __EOS__ How high? ",1
52944," Thank you for having me. __EOS__ But thanks so much for talking with us today. __EOS__ Of course, my pleasure. Thank you. __EOS__ That new movie is called Bobby, and it will be released in New York and L.A. this Friday. The nationwide release is set for November 23rd. You can get a sneak peak of the film at our Web site NPR.org/talk. ",3
52945," I don't think you're going to get an argument from the Dargers. __EOS__ No, I think it's a great point, and I think it would be great for people to step back and kind of look at that, the polygamous heritage, because there are some really incredible and amazing stories and people that have believed and lived this way. __EOS__ Jenna, is this issue addressed in your church? __EOS__ You know, I mean, it's brought up as part of our history, and, you know, we do try to, at least, you know, from my experience, the church has tried to distance itself from, you know from current practices. But I don't - I just don't understand why it needs to necessarily. ",0
52946," It's really amazing to think about that. I mean, you do reference, though, that her teammates weren't so happy about this. Babe Didrikson had an unbelievable ego. I mean, she had a lot of confidence in herself. __EOS__ She knew at a very early age that she was good, not just better than all the little girls that she was competing against, but against all the little boys she was competing against. And she would get in the heads of her teammates. She would show up and say, you know, who's going to come in second today? Babe is here. __EOS__ I'm talking with Don Van Natta about his book ""Wonder Girl  The Magnificent Sporting Life of Babe Didrikson Zaharias."" Her confidence is so remarkable, but there is this issue that comes to the fore about her gender. And all of a sudden, people starts insinuating that she's very masculine, that she might be gay, that she's involved in all these sports because she can't catch a man. Did that get under her skin? __EOS__ Oh, absolutely. The press turned on her in a vicious way. It was all men writing nasty things about her. Babe was not a very attractive woman, although, as she put it, she tried to be graceful. And it really did get under her skin. It bothered her a lot. But she dug in and just kept at it. ",0
52947,"  Make me a producer.__EOS__  No, you're an associate producer at best. You're going to do a $20 million ""Star Wars"" rip-off. You need somebody who's a somebody to put their name on it, somebody respectable, with credits, who you can trust with classified information, who'll produce a fake movie for free.__EOS__ That's a funny scene. So the little joke John Goodman makes in there about how you can teach a rhesus monkey to direct in a day...__EOS__ In a day, yeah.",1

It's been a long, a long time coming, but I know a change gonna come...__EOS__ He was a multi-talented individual with very wide range of interests. And I think his talent could have taken him just about anywhere.__EOS__ We want to go out with some music. What would you like us to play?__EOS__ Oh, my God. From the Harlem Square Club album?",2
52949," So for that kind of backup singing, you've got to, like, really deliver. I mean, you've got to be every-note precise, right?__EOS__ Yes, it's really important. You know, we rehearse beforehand. You go in on the day, and so sometimes they'll send you the tune beforehand, but then really you're - we're working out the parts that day, and then whatever group of us there are will continually rehearse those parts until we're on camera.__EOS__ What was it like for you when you started singing solo to be the front person because when you're the backup singer, you're not supposed to be upstaging the actual performer. But when you're the soloist, you have to have a persona onstage.__EOS__ It's different - you know, I've sung lead in different bands for a long time. So they were bands that weren't under my name, which was still fine because it wasn't under my - my name wasn't on the ticket. But as soon as my name was on the ticket, I thought wow, OK, now, you know, I'm getting to the venue, and I'm looking around for the star, and it's me.",3
52950," Is somebody keeping count of incidents? Have any numbers that you know of? __EOS__ I don't think so. Muslim do circulate items. But I don't think there's any study so far as to how many mosques are under attack. We do know that there may be something like 2,000 mosques in America. Some are big structures. Some are just one or two rooms. And because we were able to go to all the different kinds of mosques, we had an idea of what's going in the mosques in America today. __EOS__ Well, it's commonly observed about Muslims in America, that unlike European countries, integration has been quite successful. There isn't an anger or an antagonism. Your research finds that that may be an overly pretty picture of what's happening in this country. __EOS__ It was not before 9/11. After 9/11, there are a lot of question marks about the community. Neighbors would really like to know more about the community. They do associate them with something alien, something perhaps related to terrorism. And the Muslim community and leadership really need to do a much better job of bridging this gap of misunderstanding that we found in the field. ",3
52951," Singer and songwriter Jill Sobule has recorded six albums for four different record labels. For her latest, Sobule is going it alone. __EOS__ One, two, three, four. __EOS__ She put up a Web site in November asking for donations. Contributors would get the finished CD, of course, but inspired by public broadcasting pledge drives, she offered thank-you gifts as an enticement. __EOS__ There's T-shirts, and all the way up to I write you a theme song to I do a house concert to you get to sing a duet with me on the record. ",2
52952," Now, I read that you wanted to make sure that this cop - you know, the character you played was killed at the end, or that there were real consequences for his behavior.__EOS__ Exactly.__EOS__ Was that not the case when you first saw the script?__EOS__ No, not to the degree that was satisfying to me. Like, I told the director I couldn't justify him living in the worst way unless he died in the worst way; that the community turns their back on him, he's slapped around, crawling around on the ground like a snake and basically, gets filled full of lead. So we just made it a violent, awful ending for him.",1
52953," And I was going to ask you about that. What is driving the downturn in Las Vegas? Unemployment there now is at ten percent, that's higher than national average of 8.5 percent. And also the foreclosure rate is much higher. So what's driving that? __EOS__ Well, as far as the foreclosures are concerned, those who bought their properties as part of the American dream as their primary home, they're still in those homes. It's just a matter of time until the market comes back. It's the speculators who were going for the ride with the city because we had 10, well, nine years of unbelievable growth, fastest growing city in the United States. They wanted to go on that ride with us. And when it came to the halt that it did they are the ones who got hurt and… __EOS__ But wait a minute, when you say speculators, who are you talking about? Are you talking about investors who have plenty… __EOS__ Yeah, the fist time around that. ",3

52955," Thank you for having me.__EOS__ OK. So, let's start with your main character. He's this young man, an aspiring fashion designer from the Philippines - he's named Boy - and he comes to New York City to make his name and fortune in fashion. Tell us more about his guy.__EOS__ He moves here from Manila, where he grew up, went to fashion school and he idolizes America. And he moves here to New York. He becomes mixed up with the wrong crowd, as happens sometimes. The people who fund his label - one character in particular - winds up implicating him in a terrorist plot, and he becomes the first man arrested on U.S. soil to be captured and sent to Guantanamo Bay.__EOS__ OK. Before we get any further, let's have you read a little bit from the book - just that very first chapter.",0

52957," The doctors, it seemed, never really had enough time for all the patients, try as they might. And over the course of six months, I would corner them in the hallway and ask them a sort of naive, but fundamental question. If you had unlimited resources, what's the one thing you would give your patients? And I heard the same story again and again, a story we've heard hundreds of times since then. They said every day we have patients that come into the clinic. Child has an ear infection. I prescribe antibiotics, but the real issue is there's no food at home. The real issue is that child is living with 12 other people in a two-bedroom apartment, and I don't even ask about those issues because there's nothing I can do. I have 13 minutes with each patient. Patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room. I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is, and I don't even have any help.__EOS__ So Rebecca came up with a plan. And she started something called Health Leads, and the purpose was to help patients have the infrastructure at home, not just to get better, but to stay healthy.__EOS__ And we asked, not what do patients need to get healthy - antibiotics and inhaler medication - but what do patients need to be healthy, to not get sick in the first place. And we chose to use the prescription for that purpose. Doctors and nurses can prescribe nutritious food, heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication. Patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well-trained, college student advocates who work side-by-side with these families to connect them out to the existing landscape of community resources. So just a few miles from here at Children's National Medical Center, when patients come into the doctor's office, they're asked a few questions. They're asked are you running out of food at the end of the month? Do you have safe housing? Is the family living in a shelter?__EOS__ So that patients, like, show up at the desk and they say I've got a prescription for heat. And then what happens? I mean, can the volunteers, like, literally call up utility companies?",3
52958," So, you know - I'm not sure how to ask this, so I'll just put it this way.__EOS__ Sure.__EOS__ Did Maziar play on any guilt to get you to write and direct the movie?__EOS__ Listen. As a Jew, I am immune.",1
52959," Sex.__EOS__ ...becoming 40.__EOS__ Sex.__EOS__ I will also just say our first project was ""Finding Nemo"" where they actually came to me because I had written a version of ""Oedipus A Capella,"" a 15 minute retelling of Oedipus with an a capella group. And so it found its way to a Disney desk and they saw, oh, this girl knows how to condense things into short versions. And they said just try this ""Finding Nemo"" thing.",1
52960," Since your new book is a collection of recipes from ""Gourmet Today,"" let's talk a little bit about food and recipes. I'm kind of dreading winter because I just, like, I prefer to be warm than cold. So I want you to suggest, like, a wonderful winter dish to look forward to in winter. __EOS__ How about garlic-roasted pork shoulder? __EOS__ Hm. It wasn't what I was thinking, but it sounds good. __EOS__ How would you prepare it? ",0
52961,"  Hey, there and welcome aboard. You're right on time for another fun ride on the Soul Train. We'll be getting right back to with a great sound by Cameo right after these very important messages. __EOS__ It was produced and hosted by Don Cornelius, whose voice you heard there. How it grew from a local program in Chicago to a national institution is a subject of a new documentary on VH1 Rock Docs called, ""Soul Train  The Hippest Trip in America."" __EOS__ Thank you for having us. __EOS__ Our pleasure. ",1
52962," So you were there for more than three years. How did people react at first to this blonde American woman, you know, in the slum?__EOS__ Oh, god, at first I was a circus act. I was a freak. Everywhere I went, people would be like the Sheraton, the Hyatt, the Intercontinental. Because this slum, this slum was surrounded by luxury hotels, five luxury hotels, and people thought I'd lost my way, going from the airport to the Hyatt.__EOS__ Let me ask you to describe Annawadi, I mean, this slum. When you walk in, what do you see? How are people living?__EOS__ Well, I'll describe it this way. You come into the Mumbai International Airport, you make a turn, and you go past a lavish Hyatt and a beautiful hotel called the Grand Maratha. By the time you get to the Hyatt, which is about three minutes in your car, you've already gone past this place.",0

Thanks very much for being with us today.__EOS__ Thanks for inviting me. It's such a pleasure to be here.__EOS__ And let's start with that cross-country trip. Why did you start to bicycle across the country?__EOS__ I think it was sort of a mad curiosity. I sat down to write a novel, and I bought a typewriter - a la Kerouac - and bought one of those huge rolls of...",0
52964," Right, yeah.  __EOS__ There's the little paragraph  Nancy Mills didn't go on shopping binges the way Tanya Starling often had and Rachel Sturbridge did once or twice. Nancy still owned all of their new clothes from Aspen, Portland, and San Francisco. And at the moment, her activities were too simple to require a big wardrobe; but still, she liked to look at clothes. __EOS__ Right. That's all the same person and she changes these identities very rapidly, and without much preparation in advance.  __EOS__ What is she like? ",0
52965," Yeah, not really a - I mean, I love situations where, like, it's embarrassing. You know, this family is just putting his life - in like, 24 hours, basically, his life is hell in such a short time. It's so much fun to put - to torture people, basically, in movies; to make them suffer a little bit.__EOS__ I want to ask you about something you said earlier; about the way women are depicted in films.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ When I look back at a film like ""Before Sunset"" and ""Before Sunrise,"" and some of - some other characters over the years, it's very - kind of hazy writing; or sort of - image of the woman is a little bit romantic.",1
52966," Nevertheless, there are barriers to women's participation in sports like soccer in Afghanistan. They encountered them before they came over here and they have encountered them afterwards. __EOS__ They did. Again, whenever - I think they just saw these girls again, because they became pioneers and ambassadors and really the change makers of the sport, they're definitely pushing against a lot of the cultural and also gender barriers that that have been put up over generations. And so, I think for men to even see these girls playing, it was something new. And I think it was really easy for them right away to react negatively and to question them and to put them down. __EOS__ Well, tell us - we'd like to hear some of these more personal stories. I mean, there's a girl who's, I think, a particular interest to you - well, they're all of particular interest to you. But there's a girl named Robina that you write about a great deal. __EOS__ Yes, I do. She was definitely the quiet leader on that trip. And although she wasn't always as vocal to express her feelings immediately, she always was able to take in what was going on. And when she did speak up, the girls listened. So, she was that type of leader. And certainly, in going back to Afghanistan, you see that come out. I think she is definitely much more of a deep thinker and always really - has always been a very sensitive individual as well from my work with her. ",0
52967,"   I remember not to long      ago, I was just a lonely person with a lonely heart. __EOS__  A memorial service is scheduled in New York City today for the      late Luther Vandross.  Many consider him the greatest R&B singer of our      time.  When Vandross died last week, he left an extraordinary musical      legacy.  His trademark was his soulful, sophisticated and unmistakably      silky voice.  He was a master of the contemporary love song, a crooner      who developed a reputation as the balladeer's balladeer. __EOS__   And you're gonna get the chance to love me.      Wait for love, wait for love.  Oh, woman. __EOS__  It's not just his      voice, you know?  It's his sense of drama. ",2

So, it just - you know, I just loved it.__EOS__  ...for the wheel's still in spin, and there's no telling who that it's namin'...__EOS__ It's Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame producer Lou Adler and legendary singer Merry Clayton. Thanks so much for coming in.__EOS__ Our pleasure.",2
52969," Brian, I know you're completing a new book now. Are you still writing about combat in Iraq?__EOS__ I'm actually writing about what I feel is missing back here. I was trying to write poems that were in Iraq, the poems that I'd started over there but never were finished, and I found that they weren't working. And I realized that, you know, of course I'm no longer there, so I can't write those poems. But I started looking around and seeing that, you know, we're a country at war, but disturbingly, I don't see war like in Marfa, Texas, or Fresno, California, where I'm from. I'm not seeing it in my daily life. I'm not experiencing.

52970," To which the queen replies? __EOS__  ""That's quite a question."" __EOS__ Can I just ask - because this is a book aiming, in a way, at childhood, and because it is funny. I'm curious if each of you can recall a moment when you realized that you could be funny, that you could make a living being funny? __EOS__ For me, it was way late to my career to lose the idea that everything was going to vanish within the next three or four months. ",0
52971," Is there any part of her story that particularly resonates with you?__EOS__ I just think the idea of her having the courage to not back down from what she believes, and then when she got into more difficulty, how her value system strengthened even more. And I have to tell you that you might not necessarily believe in her political beliefs, and you might not necessarily appreciate her stance on certain things, but I tell you what. There's not a human being that I don't think that could look at Angela Davis and have respect for the courage to stick to her values and stay strong in her convictions through all of the turmoil that she encountered. And that is something to respect, because I - you don't see that a lot these days.__EOS__ You know, in the past, she's - Angela Davis - have heard her in interviews lament the fact that she's remembered for her hairdo by some people. Is there some way in which you're hoping that this film will redirect how she is seen?__EOS__ Oh, absolutely. I think that, you know, another reason why I felt like this movie needed to be brought to the forefront is because I think that people will see Angela Davis as a human being. She's been kind of like this - just this figure that you see on t-shirts with this afro, and people call her a radical and, you know - and you don't really connect a human side to her. You just know her as a revolutionary or, you know, you do connect power to her, but you don't really see her as a woman or as a human being.",1

52973," Fantastic. __EOS__ That was a good time. __EOS__ David Clemo, how about you? __EOS__ I was airborne while I was in the military, which means I jumped out of planes. So I was stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where I deployed to Afghanistan in 2002. And then I deployed to Iraq in 2005. And then after that I got stationed at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, where I actually worked as the assistant director of the U.S. Army soldier show. ",2

Mathosa heard Dube singing and invited her onstage one night, then took the teenager under her wing.__EOS__ Definitely, she created who Nkulee Dube is onstage, I think, because I would look at her onstage. And then when she gets ups, she would say did you see what I did there? I moved from that corner to the end of that corner because there's people all around the stage, so you have to perform for each and every person.__EOS__ That was more than she got from her father at first. She didn't grow up with him, though her mother told her who he was. She waited until she was 18 to knock on his studio door.__EOS__ And then he looked at me, stared at me, 'cause I had dreadlocks longer than this actually. And he's like who are you? I'm like Nkulee. Like, yeah, who are you? I was like, no, I'm Nkulee. Why, why are you asking? He's like what are you doing here? No, I'm here to see you. OK. Sit down. Let's talk. Who are you?

52975," Thank you, Neal. __EOS__ Tell us a little bit about that moment in 1988 that swept the university, the biggest protest until today. __EOS__ That was an important moment. It was the - it was an expression of deaf pride. The issue was pretty clear back then  shouldn't a school that prides itself on educating deaf students have a president who's deaf? And Gallaudet had never had one before. Students demanded that it was time to have one. They closed down the gates of the university, closed down the university -much as we're seeing today. And finally, the board of trustees relented and chose I. King Jordan, who was a popular dean. And this became a great moment, a glorious moment in sort of the history of deaf people in this country. __EOS__ And this debate and this protest today seems to echo a lot of what happened in 1988, yet the issue isn't quite so clear.

52978," And it's the story of this kind of lonely, emotionally-starved man who develops film at the one-hour photo desk of a big discount store and kind of develops an obsessive interest in a young family whose picture he has developed for many years. This is an original screenplay. You wrote this. Where did the idea of this character come from, this photo guy? __EOS__ Well, I, you know, I've been always fascinated by those giant, over-lit, overly stocked American discount department stores. They just always seemed like visually really striking places. And I said - there was a guy that worked at the local one-hour photo place where I lived in West Hollywood and the guy was kind of a strange character. He sort of was - always seemed like he was on stage. He was trying too hard. He was always trying to be overly charming and overly familiar with his customers. __EOS__ Well the character, Sy Parrish, is played in your film by Robin Williams, and I thought we'd listen to a clip. It's a voiceover where Sy Parrish's character is just talking about his work and about pictures. __EOS__  I'm sure my customers never think about it, but these snapshots are their little stands against the flow of time - the shutters clicked, the flash goes off and they've stopped time, just for the blink of an eye. And if these pictures have anything important to say to future generations, it's this  I was here. I existed. I was young, I was happy and someone cared enough about me in this world to take my picture. ",1

52981," Let's take a quick question from Scott in Cazenovia, New York. Scott? __EOS__ That's right, Cazenovia, New York. Sir Roger, just a pleasure to talk with you and allow me to say that for 35 years. Since the very early '70s, my family, taken - my brother and I, my parents, my brother and I, at this this very early age, we go to see the James Bond movies and we've gone to see every James Bond movie in the theaters. It's always a family event. And I have to say that you and Sean Connery have defined what it is for - who James Bond is.  __EOS__ Well, thank you very much. Thank you. That was very kind of you. Somebody - yesterday in a radio interview said that they compared going to a Bond to be a father and son bonding and that the boy really came of age when his father said to him come on son, I'll take you to see a Bond movie. It never occurred to me before but it's sounds like a very good selling point for my book. You have a bond, bond, bond with Bond and by your son or by your dad Bond's book. __EOS__ My guest is Sir Roger Moore. You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News. And let's go to Curtis in Oklahoma City. You have a family tradition as well? ",0
52982,"  What do you mean?__EOS__  Where's everybody?__EOS__  We thought there was a party.__EOS__  Oh my God, you thought the party was tonight?",3
52983," A very dedicated nurse, let us explain.__EOS__ Oh, yes. Quite accommodating.__EOS__ How do we say this? Cherishes her patients.__EOS__ She likes to please them. I will never read that chapter aloud in front of an audience, I can tell you that right now. I was embarrassed for her.",0
52984," Listening to your album, I swear I can pick out sort of classic recordings of jazz in there looped - I'm trying to listen for it… __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ Are there actual vintage recordings in your recordings? Did you sample old albums? __EOS__ Not really. What I do is I get musicians to comment and copy things and I distress the recordings and made things sound old and like there are some old things. I'm not going to say I didn't sample anything. I'm not going to say what I sampled and I'm also going to say, without a doubt, whatever I use is so recontexualized and murderized that it would be impossible to know what's what. ",2
52985," Yeah. It becomes a kind of hyper self-consciousness, where you...__EOS__ Yeah. It becomes a religious experience for me sometimes.__EOS__ Do you find...__EOS__ A little thought as a religious experience, isn't that crazy?",1
52986," So, you start looking into this material. And I have to say, Diane Johnson, you are from Moline, Illinois. You have an incredible wealth of material. I mean, you just mentioned, you know, some things lying in a drawer. But your family had been in that part of the country since 1826. Tell us about Catharine Martin. I was fascinated by her. You pointed out that she was living around the time of Jane Austen, had a much harder time of it and in 1876 she writes about the previous century.__EOS__ Yes. Thank heavens it was a little bit of a literary impulse. Catharine Anne Martin sat down an wrote her memoirs in 1876. But she was born in 1800. And she's about roughly contemporary a little bit younger than Jane Austen. And in 1826, when she went to Illinois, that's about the same time that the girls in ""Pride and Prejudice"" were much more comfortably outfitted and living a very different life than pioneer grandmothers on the American frontier, which was what Illinois was at that time.__EOS__ The other thing is that Catharine Anne Martin isn't the only forebear. You can go back much further than that. You have letters from her mother, this woman Anne, who's born in 1779 in Claremont, New Hampshire. I guess that most of us couldn't imagine having documents going back that far. And you had no idea?__EOS__ I really didn't. I didn't know that it would go back that far and I didn't know about the first forebear that all of these people claimed as their ancestor - and it's pretty well documented. Rene Cosset, a Frenchman, must have been a French soldier, who enters history in 1711, and he was captured by the British because it was the time of the Queen Anne's War. And he, Rene, who is by now in America called Ranna, because they can't pronounce Rene, Ranna Cossitt is mustered to be, traded to the French, and Ranna enters history because he didn't want to be repatriated. He said no thanks, I'd rather be a prisoner my whole life and remain in America. No one quite knows why, you know.",0
52987," There is one collaboration that took you far, far away. And that was that in the 1980s you traveled to China and blended traditional Chinese music with your music. Let's just play a moment of that.__EOS__ You have there playing which is what they call a Chinese orchestra. But it's their folk instrument. So, some of the pieces you will hear - I mean melody-wise there's a big difference. But the same ideas about music, to do with the seasons, to do with love, to do with battles that took place, just is so Irish in a way. And we took a trip down the Yangtze River with all our Chinese friends, and we got them up dancing the ""Walls of Limerick,"" which is a set dance, an Irish set dance.__EOS__ So, they were very suspicious about that at the beginning, you know. And they weren't quite sure what to make of us, you know?__EOS__ But the Maotai was taking effect on them as well as us. The Maotai, it's a little drink, you know? And gan bei is their - instead of slainte or good luck to you. You know, it was gan bei. That means bottoms up.",2
52988," Well, you've actually hit the nail on the head about a hard decision to write it, because when I began writing the book, when I got to this part of my life, I was like am I going to write about this? Am I going to include this in the book? And my first editor, Colleen Daly, said just write it. You can always decide not to leave it in. I did leave it in, and the reason I left it in is because there are women - and some men - who experience domestic abuse who, you know, who feel ashamed, who think it's their fault, who don't think they deserve to be safe or don't remember what it's like to be safe. And I thought if women and men out there - again, mostly women - read this and say, wow, she was successful. She had financial independence. She had it so together and she could be in a relationship like that? Maybe I' not so bad. Maybe it's not my fault.__EOS__ You and Gerry Goffin wrote the song ""He Hit Me ,"" which The Crystals recorded.__EOS__ Good point.__EOS__ Yeah. And I always hear that song and I think, like, wow, big difference between being slugged and being kissed. And I wonder, like, after having experienced abuse, what you think of that song.",0
52989," Oh, I just thought he was one of the greatest singers I've ever heard in my life and still do. He - all the things that I thought about him that I thought would make him a great suitor, when he was on that stage, he looked different. He was just a totally different person on the stage. __EOS__ Singer Bettye LaVette speaking with Terry Gross. More after a break. This is Fresh Air. __EOS__ In 1972, you recorded an album that was never released until 2005. __EOS__ Mm hmm. ",2
52990," If I were a boy, I think I'd understand how it feels to love a girl. I swear I'd be a better man. I'd listen to her 'cause I know how it hurts to lose the one you wanted, when you're taking her for granted. And everything you had got destroyed.__EOS__  If I were a boy. I think I could understand.__EOS__ Someone recently came up and said that they had not heard that song before. And it made them go and listen to it, which is like the highest compliment there is for me.__EOS__ That's actor Nina Millin. Nina, thank you so much for talking with us about the Beyonce logs.",2
52991," You know, Amanda, the story is out there that you also will occasionally eat fire on stage. Do you want to put that rumor to rest? __EOS__ I should. Well, I like rumors on occasion. That's a good one because it makes us sound so entertaining. __EOS__ You're  with  there. You're making it all so smooth, you're in love with this stuff. __EOS__ My dad did teach me to eat fire when I was a teenager. He does that. He's a clown and variety entertainer. I have not tried it since I was 18. ",2
52992," I want to play a few extra innings. __EOS__ Yeah, you want to go into overtime. __EOS__ I want to go into overtime, right.  __EOS__ How many do you think you will be able to play? ",0
52993,  Let's party. __EOS__  L.A. __EOS__  Let's party. __EOS__  Key West. ,2
52994," Though in reinterpreting that song I imagined her sitting in front of a radio and every two bars you hear a different iconic rock riff, as if she was flipping through the radio dials and hence the schizophrenic nature of that song. There's a lot of, you know, allusions to some pretty famous rock tunes. __EOS__ Let's listen to some of what you went crazy with. This is, for many people, it's a signature song, ""Climb Every Mountain."" __EOS__  But got the armor that shoots you  so you can't, like you're supposed to honor that.  like the song track,  like the tower that smells so good . Climb every mountain, ford every stream... __EOS__ So, help us to understand the musical choices you made. ",2
52995," I'm interested in your approach to casting because you have this whole like stable of people, like a whole repertoire of cast you develop from basically from ""Freaks and Geeks."" There's like Seth Rogen and Jason Segel and... __EOS__ James Franco. __EOS__ James Franco. Yes. James Franco. And it's just kind of amazing that you started working with these people before they had worked any place else, before anybody knew who they were, and you've kept working with them. They've all become stars. Can you talk a little bit about like discovering people who you want to work with and then staying with them? __EOS__ When we were looking for the cast for ""Freaks and Geeks,"" we knew that we would rewrite the script based on the actors we found. Paul had very specific ideas for each character. But it seemed more interesting to just find unique personalities and have Paul revise it to their traits. And so, we fell in love with all these kids. And when the show was cancelled, I thought, well, I've just scratched the surface of what you can do with these people. So I used a lot of them in ""Undeclared."" ",1
52996," Thank you very much, Neal. __EOS__ And Doctor Oz, let's begin with those questions we asked in the beginning. If somebody needs surgery, who is the best medical professional they should go to for a recommendation? __EOS__ Well, it turns out it's probably the nurse, and the reason for that is because a nurse deals with all the doctors. Physicians have a little bit of insight into what their specialty may be, but they often don't follow in great detail what other doctors do in other areas. Nurses, especially in the emergency room, have a broad array of exposure, so they often can have insights that others in the healthcare community don't, and... __EOS__ Hmm. It's interesting you say that because in your book you say the anesthesiologist. ",0
52997," And you've bought the instruments to record it on eBay and then sold them back on eBay. Is that true or is that just somebody's public relations story? __EOS__ No, it is actually true. We didn't have many resources to record the first record and we took the little money we had and bought recording equipment off the Internet pretty much. And then once we were done recording, you know, we didn't need that equipment anymore, we just turned around and put it on eBay and actually, I think, I remember making a little bit more money that I'd paid for in a couple of items. __EOS__ So all of a sudden, we were profiting from this album. __EOS__ Let me ask about another song, if we could here. There's a song called -we're going to hear a little of it, ""1,000 Wives."" ",2
52998," Ah, no, we weren't and, I'm told - I've read from what the editor of The New York Times has said, that the administration did enlist some Democrats and some Republicans to urge that. But we should note, that since the story ran Senator Arlen Specter, the Republican Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said that he doesn't know whether this program is legal, and that he thinks that the administration opt to submit it to some Congressional scrutiny. __EOS__ The New York Times is, as you mentioned, has gotten a special attention on this because they also broke the NSA warrantless wiretap program back in December. At least one member of Congress says he wants The New York Times charged with treason for this latest news story. __EOS__ Politicians use rhetoric all the time. It would be a good thing for Congress to get involved in a serious way and to review whether this program is legal, to review whether the safeguards are adequate, to review whether the oversight is adequate. __EOS__ But when a government official, who clearly knows more than you do about security programs that are ongoing and presumably knows more than any of us that who don't get classified information about threats to the country, when this official says to you, please don't run this, just how do you make that decision to go ahead and do it? ",3
52999," Mr. Johnson, good luck to you, sir. __EOS__  Thank you. __EOS__ Lee Johnson, talking about his orchestral tribute to the Grateful Dead called ""Dead Symphony No. 6.""

53000," Well, you know, and we're not saying everybody needs to wear a costume. But take your own life, for example. Down your street can you really tell what the street looks like day-to-day? You pass things every day and after a certain point you tend to disregard it. And so the costume, when I walk down the street, the whole street is looking at me. It brings a spotlight to a situation. When I help homeless, doing it without a costume is absolutely wonderful but other people never seem to notice that anymore. It becomes just another image on the side of the road. When you see me walking down the street helping a homeless, you're looking to see what I am and what I'm doing, but then the bigger picture is the homeless on the street. __EOS__ What would you like us to learn from your experience. And DC, you want to start and then Phoenix, you can pick up? __EOS__ Well, we all bring something different to the table, but every table is different. My fight in Washington, D.C. is different than Phoenix's. And so people think that we're polar opposites, but we're not really. We're fighting the same war. We just have different battles to win the war. __EOS__ Well, why do you say that people think you're polar opposites? ",3
53001," You lost the engine? The only engine?__EOS__ Yeah. It was starting to go. I mean, what happens is the prop goes over red line and you can't bring it back and so, you know, you know that the engine's getting torn up. And, you know, when I finally landed the guys at the airport who, you know, took the engine apart, said they'd never seen one so torn up that wasn't, like, in a wreck. So we were very lucky.__EOS__ When you say over the red line you mean, like, what? Short of oil or something? Or burning up?__EOS__ No, the RPMs.",0
53002," Thank you, Liane. It's so nice to be with you. __EOS__ It's nice to see you. In this time when a woman really couldn't get a formal education - although women were allowed to go into Charles Wilson Peale's Museum and get an informal one - sometimes they didn't even own clothing, a married woman couldn't own property, what kind of influence could a woman have on politics? __EOS__ Enormous influence. Dolley Madison was incredibly influential. In fact, she really ran her husband James Madison's campaign for president.  __EOS__ Now, how did she run it? Kind of in the tearoom? ",0
53003," Yes, because he understood at that moment you accepted him as your father. __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ Yes. __EOS__ Yes. ",0
53004," We should say, though, that this is - you are an established - people would call you a classical cellist. I mean, you play a lot of nontraditional repertoire, and you use that kind of processing that we talked about. But this is still a departure for you.__EOS__ Yeah, I guess it is, although, you know, if you look at the trajectory of all the things I've done, this is very much within line because my whole kind of career mission has been to re-introduce new ideas and new sounds for the cello.__EOS__ You know, I have this feeling - it's something I complain about - is that I feel like classical music in America feels very conservative - that it - sometimes it's hard to hear music that's been written in modern times.__EOS__ Oh, it does. It does, Arun. It's a big problem.",2
53005," Well, Judd Apatow, it's really been great to talk with you. Thank you so much. __EOS__ It has been a pleasure being here and soon I will be listening to this while putting myself to sleep. __EOS__ Sweet dreams. __EOS__ Thank you. ",1
53006," I didn't. It's a good idea but ""See My Friends"" seems to be see my friends. It's friends like these, who needs enemies? It's a natural. When Spoon recorded it, it just fitted what the album was. __EOS__  See my friends, Layin' 'cross the river... __EOS__ Bruce Springsteen really surprised. You know, he expressed some interest to be on the record. And I naturally thought it would be one of the usual suspects, you know, ""You Really Got Me,"" ""All Day and All of the Night."" And he chose a song called ""Better Things."" __EOS__  Here's wishing you the bluest sky, and hoping something better comes tomorrow. ",2
53007," I got to be one of the guys so much, I used to have the girls waiting for me… __EOS__ In her 1981 autobiography, ""High Times, Hard Times,"" O'Day explained that her last name was Colton, but she changed it to O'Day because in pig Latin, O'Day meant dough, and she hoped to make plenty of it. Unfortunately, most of the money she did make from her records and concerts went into her arm. __EOS__ The Life of a Jazz Singer"" includes excerpts from a number of radio and television interviews with her, including one she recorded with Terry Gross, which we're about to hear. __EOS__  Some day, when I'm awfully low, and the world is cold, I will feel a glow just thinking of you, just the way you look tonight. ",2
53008," I was told by relatives, you know, aunts and uncles, that, you know - I remember going home for a funeral of one of my cousins that I really didn't know very well, and someone came up to me and said, hey, you did it. And I was like, I did it? She goes, yeah, you used to say when were 5 - 6 years old, running around here, that you wanted to be an actor. I said, I did? She was like, yeah, you used to say that. So I guess it was something that was in my mind very early. I know that I got very serious about it once I graduated from high school. I had a few choices - to either pursue acting or to pursue music. And I think I really looked at what it would take to really commit to being a musician - the work and the kind of commitment to that- and realized that I was not ready for that.__EOS__ I understand, though, that you got your first paid acting jobs while you were still in drama school, right?__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ And you've been working pretty steadily since the 1980s. Do you feel like you've made it now?",1
53009," They write Greek tragedies. __EOS__ Right. __EOS__ OK. Well, send us some interns. __EOS__ Julia Duin is a religion writer who lives in Maryland. Her most recent book is ""Days of Fire and Glory."" She was kind enough to join us here in our Washington, D.C. studios. Karen Hooper is a frequent contributor to The Washington Post magazine. She joined us from the studios of the Baltimore Sun newspaper in Baltimore, Maryland. ",3
53010," Well, I mean, I think this book stands in a proud Snicket tradition of a reassurance that dark things are, in fact, there. So ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" reminds you that a terrible thing can happen at any moment, and that it is up to you to persevere through it. And I think ""The Dark"" teaches that same message. It may stop at a slightly different part of the story, whereas a volume in ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" would usually have the story be more or less complete, and then the villain would get away at the last minute or some other terrible thing would happen.__EOS__ What scared you as a child?__EOS__ Oh, everything. Tall trees. Yeah, people in tall trees climbing up to the top of them and leaping upon my window. That was a large source of concern for me. Kidnapping. I remember when my mother finally explained to me that it would be extremely unlikely I would get kidnapped, because they didn't really have any money, that kidnappers were after money.__EOS__ That's great.",0
53011," Could I ask you to take us out on that song? __EOS__ Sure. __EOS__  Now if I had a million dollars, I'd give every dime just to hear you call me daddy one more time. And I'm begging you, I'm begging you come on in this old house. You hear me holler? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I love you so. Well come back baby, 'cause you know I am to blame. I got another woman and you got yourself a man. And I'm begging you, I'm begging you, come on in this old house. You hear me holler, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I love you so. __EOS__ Mr. Hammond, thanks so much. ",2
53012," Mm-hmm. __EOS__ Someone might say, well, aren't you kind of fudging of the details here, and that gives you some ability to exaggerate? __EOS__ To a certain extent. It's difficult. It turns out that when you throw pies at people's faces, they sometimes get upset about that. And so in these litigious days, it became important in many instances do not identify people by name, partially for legal reasons, partially because, in many cases, they were decent people trying to do the right thing who shouldn't be blamed personally by name for what they did because they were following orders. They were doing the things that they were told to do. __EOS__ ...and the sheep for widows programs, all of those are as accurate as you can make them? ",0
53013,"  Held your standards close to heart, but late one night, you threw them down...__EOS__ How do you sort of decide how far to go in the direction of the bands that influenced you versus kind of stepping back and try to create something completely new?__EOS__ Yes. I think I got so in love with a band that I just end up pretty much copying them. And I hope that the originality can come from the fact that you're in love with 1,000 bands and they're all completely different. So when you copy all of them at once, that's how you create something new.__EOS__ And is it fair to say that Radiohead's a band that you love?",2
53014," Yeah, the syntax in the middle of the 19th century is not all that antiquated. I mean, if you read any American authors from that time, it's more ornate, but certainly syntactically, the structures of the sentences are virtually identical to ours. My main concern was to make it playable, that it had to be language that wouldn't get in the way either of what the actors needed to do with it or the audience hearing it, that it rang true.__EOS__ Words like shindy and flibflub appear here. What's a shindy?__EOS__ A shindig, a party.__EOS__ OK, and flibflub?",1
53015," No.__EOS__ So it must have been terrifying to have you be taken away,__EOS__ Yeah, that was...__EOS__ And not knowing when you would return.",3
53016," That's great.__EOS__ That was the name of it. How's that? And I was so excited to have a job, you know.__EOS__ Who had the toupee? Was it - it wasn't you, right?__EOS__ I couldn't remember now. It wasn't Raymond Burr, but somebody did, some blonde did. But those were your apprenticeship years and it's always sort - one of the things that's sort of weird is to see yourself characterized so often as somebody that looks well, that has glamorous looks or is appealing physically. That's nice. I mean I'm not unhappy about that, but what I saw happening over time was that was getting the attention. And sometimes - because I always felt that I was an actor and that's how I started.",3
53017," I want candy. __EOS__  Candy. I call my sugar candy because I'm sweet on candy and candy's sweet on me. __EOS__ What may be surprising is that Clamor grew up in the Philippines.

53018," Well, certainly given the  for these transactions which got up to as high as around $50 billion at the end of a quarter in 2008  clearly, financial statements that didn't have those numbers in them would be misleading and tough to decipher. The second question, though, as to whether or not SEC examiners should have caught this, especially since they were inside Lehman is a fair question. Auditors just in the normal course tend to look at transactions close to the end of a quarter. __EOS__ Lynn Turner, thank you so much for talking with us. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ Lynn Turner, senior advisor and managing director of the consulting firm LEGC, formerly a senior accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission spoke to us from Broomfield, Colorado.

53019," Yes, hi. I just wanted to comment on what we were talking about a little bit earlier, how using handwriting or doodling is able to improve someone's mental health.

53020," You're welcome, yes. __EOS__ But, you know, I love, like, kiddie talent shows because what always happens on those is that the children are coached by older people to perform like performers from older generations. And there's always some, like, really weird disconnect to see, like, a 10-year-old pretending like he's Sammy Davis or something, you know. __EOS__ Right, right, right, a 10-year-old pretending like he's Alan Jackson. __EOS__ Exactly, thank you, yeah. So what was that like for you, I mean, to... ",1
53021," Why did you decide to take this on, to try to make this into a movie?__EOS__ Well, I guess I'm a little bit masochistic, in a way. You know, there have actually been a history of great directors and great screenwriters, in Denmark, trying to tackle this story for 30 years. But they've all failed. And when I...__EOS__ Why did they fail?__EOS__ I think it's because it's a really difficult story to write because it not only has great romance; it's also a very strong political thriller. And then you also have the crazy king - you have all these various characters - and it takes place over the course of six, seven years. And this is an expensive film. It needed big costumes, big - you know, locations, horses, carriages; all these things - CGI. We were lucky to be the ones that actually wrote a script that was good enough to finance an expensive film.",1

53023," Unfortunately, because Washington now is a very busy town full of traffic, it didn't make sense recording the bell from down the street level. The best way was to get up in the belfry itself, crawl around and get really close next to the bell so you could isolate the sound as best as possible from the modern-day sounds of the city. And then we used it as an off-screen effect in the ambience of the movie.__EOS__ Let me ask you about one more sound, because this is amazing. This is the sound of carriage doors opening and closing.__EOS__ You took this from Lincoln's actual carriage.__EOS__ The carriage that Lincoln rode to and from Ford's Theater is actually in the Studebaker Museum in South Bend, Indiana. And it's obviously too delicate and too valuable to be hooked up to horses and run through the streets anymore. But they allowed us to come and record the doors opening and closing, the latches and the doors.",1
53024," So how soon do you think - how long will it be before we see commercially sold fuel cell vehicles? __EOS__ Well, it's possible to do it very soon. Part of the problem with hydrogen is it's been oversold in the future. You know, George Bush anointed it as the fuel of the future a few years ago, and in some ways, that was not good for hydrogen because there was a lot of backlash, you know, because of who was supporting it. __EOS__ And they are emission free? __EOS__ They are emission free, yes.

They're really enjoying this. They love the challenge. __EOS__ How long does it take, in a typical classroom, for a group of kids to pass out, pass in or receive papers passed out from a teacher? And ordinarily, a group of teachers will say a minute, a minute and a half. Sometimes the numbers are higher. __EOS__ To master fractions. Yeah. __EOS__ Yeah, it's, you know, it's very simple. It's beneath the radar screen. It's incredibly powerful. It's almost inexcusable not to do it. ",0
53027," Hi, Tift. I am calling from Austin. I'm hoping that one of those 200-seat rooms you are going to play might be the Cactus, here in Austin. __EOS__ Oh, you know, I had heard the Cactus was closing. __EOS__ The Cactus is in transition. But we... __EOS__ OK. Good. ",2
53028," So let me begin by saying, this is an extremely rare form of diabetes. It's not at all related to juvenile diabetes, which is the form that's normally found in children. This is a rare form, where you're actually born with the disease. But what's been marvelous about this is that having identified the cause of it, we've been able to offer a different therapy for people who are born with this disease.__EOS__ Now, how does this relate to electricity?__EOS__ Ah, it relates to electricity because the current that flows through those tiny pores, those channels - which is what we call them - is actually an electric current. It's just that this time, it's carried by potassium ions - not by electrons. And it generates electrical impulses in the pancreatic cells, and that's what's necessary for insulin release. So these cells fire electrical impulses in just the same way as your nerve cells do.__EOS__ And through your research - as a result of your research, now, people who are born with this type of diabetes - neonatal diabetes - they can take pills to regulate their diabetes, as opposed to self-injecting. And that's an extraordinary change in their lives, thanks to you and your research partners. When you first made the discovery, what happened in the lab? Just tell us about that moment of breakthrough.",0
53029," So you know, with House, the way you do House's voice, it's, you know, it's as if a lot of his dialogue was muttered under his breath or said between clenched teeth, you know, said as an aside, even when it's not really an aside. But sometimes it is an aside, it's just a very sarcastic aside that everybody hears...__EOS__ Right.__EOS__ ...because he's saying it loud enough for everybody. But - so is that intentional on your part? And can you talk about like placing your voice and maybe demonstrate that a little bit?__EOS__ Well, it's, of course it's a sort of a dance you do with the sound recordist. You have to know that the sound recordist is working on the same - well, literally the same wavelength as your radio transmitter, but also on a sort of artistic wavelength. They're very, very good at what they do and it's a good partnership. They have to know how you're going to place your voice and the two of you are really working together.",3
53030," Yeah. It's quite a big deal.__EOS__ I was going to say did you have lots of meetings about that?__EOS__ You know, the cool thing about being a movie director and a slight dork, is that you get to sort of play around with a superhero - well, with the Superman costume in this case. But what we wanted to do with the costume is make it feel like it was based on, you know, this alien technology and culture. And so that when he wore it, it wasn't like a thing that, you know, his mom sewed out of a blanket or anything like that.__EOS__ Which is some of the...",1
53031," Yes, he was an incredible man who basically fought off the Soviets and the Taliban. And he really loved art and poetry, and I was just very touched by the story of Massoud and someone who would, at such a young age, make major sacrifices. I mean, he couldve left the country during the Soviet invasion. He had the capabilities of doing that, and he decided to stay behind and help. __EOS__ Ahmad Shah Massoud, we should explain, rather famously died just before 9/11, didn't he? __EOS__ Yes, he was assassinated by suicide bombers that were, you know, members of al-Qaida. And so, that was another that reason I felt in the time of making this album it felt very timely to pay homage to Massoud. __EOS__ Tell us what it was like to record an album in Afghanistan. ",2
53032," I think it makes sense. We're three Americans near the border. You know, when we were captured, I thought that, you know, this maybe will last a week or two, because it's not going to take them long to find out that we're not spies. We would have been pretty bad spies. We don't speak Farsi. Sarah wasn't wearing a hijab. We didn't even have Iranian currency. But after a couple of months, after our interrogations kind of wrapped up, our interrogators told us that they knew that we weren't spies. Our incarceration was about the political dynamics between their government and our government, and that the politicians in these two countries were going to have to work out our release.__EOS__ So, on the day-to-day, it seems like sharing was one key to your sanity. Josh Fattal, you speak of sharing candy with young Iranian political prisoners once you all arrived at Evin Prison in Tehran.__EOS__ I remember the small mistakes by guards could turn into a huge advantage for us. So, one time they took us to the courtyard, and there were Iranian prisoners in the courtyard. And normally the Americans are supposed to be alone in there. In that meantime, we crossed paths with these prisoners, and I remember they said to us cell 53, cell 53. And it was just that little piece of information that allowed us to whisper into cell 53 every day that allowed us to coordinate sneaking candies to each other under the sink in the bathroom, into the common bathroom.__EOS__ Huh. So, were you able to communicate in any substantial way with the other prisoners around you?",0

He has a new novel, based on the life of bank robber Willie Sutton. The new novel is called ""Sutton.""__EOS__ Well, we did a lot of things together. And the first thing that we did was we started a long really wonderful conversation about his life. It worked like therapy. I did - I sat in a straight back chair and Andre sat on a couch and I had a pad in my lap and he really, he dug deep, and together we found patterns and themes in his life. But it did get to the point where I was really worried that I might make some suggestion or render some analysis that would leave him, you know, helpless to Steph and the kids. So I started reading, like, Freud and Jung and...__EOS__ ...and giving myself this crash course in psychology and he thought that was hysterical. But I was really worried that, I mean, he was digging so deep that I wouldn't be able to get him, you know, back to the surface.__EOS__ Yeah. Because he had a father who was very demanding and basically kind of insisted that he be super serious about tennis in a way that obviously makes it seem like he didn't really want to be.",0

But was it a surprise to learn that it's been selected as a freshman read?__EOS__ Yes, oh, well, deeply.

53039,"  I think the phrase `for sale' should      be banned... __EOS__  .... __EOS__  ...should be banned from selling homes because the way      we look at it, it's not a house for sale, it's a house for auction. __EOS__  The couple sit with their agent, Cynthia Cohn, and      strategize about their next offer on a ranch-style home near good schools      and with views of the mountains.  At Cohn's suggestion, they're enhancing      their bid with an emotional letter on what the house means to them. ",3

When he was four, this happened and it was such a devastation for him. It was kind of almost the first time he experienced something he loved ending and that he couldn't get that back.__EOS__ Now, in years past, you have drawn - or I guess painted is more appropriate - children's books about some unusual subjects.

It's true I didn't - all these years - I didn't want to say it, but it's true. Something about Gene on that show was something that I could relate to. Once I met Roger in person however - case closed.

And it sounds like, Marcy, you're just a very open person who's very honest with your emotions, and that when you don't like someone, you make it really known. So, in a way, that's actually, I think, a gift, because you don't have the ambiguity of does he like me? Does he not like me? It sounds like with you, we know where you stand. ",0
53045," Well, I'm delighted to have you. And I'm going to start with you because I want you to tell us the story of the Irish and their role in the Mexican-American War. __EOS__ The story itself is just fascinating. And when I saw the name John Riley, a man from Connemara in the west of Ireland, and he was enlisted against his wishes, I would believe he was given a rifle to go down there and shoot Mexicans - and that didn't go down too well at all. __EOS__ We are the San Patricios, a brave and gallant band. They'll be no white flag flying within this green command. We are the San Patricios. We have but one demand  to see the Yankees safely home across the Rio Grande. __EOS__ You have Liam Neeson narrating a poem in tribute to the San Patricios, on the CD.

53046," Well, the truth was that the original pitch to HBO was that it would get to that whistleblower place in the first season, but as I started writing it, I realized there was, like, kind of nooks and crannies of her life that I wanted to explore, and, I don't know, I got more interested in the digressions than the overall, like, meta-plot. And so as I got into it, I was like we're not going to be able to this here.__EOS__ So I'm going to ask you to describe your character, Tyler, and one of the episodes in this season of ""Enlightened"" was told from the perspective of your character. So describe Tyler and how you envisioned him changing in season two.__EOS__ I felt like Amy needed to have, like, her Ethel at the office or like Ethel to her Lucy. And it felt like, you know, Amy has these kind of - in a way she's feminine, but she also has this kind of - she has some traditionally masculine aspects. She wants to be part of the public, so she's very, you know, extroverted. She's very kind of in her own way aggressive. And I just thought it would be interesting from, like, you know, a gender place to, like, have her help-mate be, like, a guy, but he's, like, the supporter, more passive, the one who's just kind of helping her and is more kind of the introvert. And so it was basically his, like, unreciprocated crush on her that kind of drove him to continue helping her.__EOS__ And, you know, Amy thinks that in order to get access to corporate emails that can help blow the whistle on what the corporation's doing wrong and help, you know, bring, you know, charges against the CEO, she asked your character Tyler, who, you know, knows a lot about IT, to basically break into the hard drive of the CEO's assistant, who's played by Molly Shannon.",1
53047," Yeah.   __EOS__ Did you read the novel?   __EOS__ Yes I did. I mean it was actually one of the Graham Greene novels that I wanted to read for a very long time. But I'm a ferocious reader so it was one of the ones that I hadn't read. I did start to read it when Rowan and I embarked on the project. And I'd try. And I'd say god Rowan, I'm just not sure if this is really helping it slightly. Inner workings of Pinkie's brain I don't need to know his diatribe. I need to focus more on what Rose believes, which is that he's utterly in love with her because she wants to believe it. And Rowan said my god, what are you doing? Stop, stop reading.   __EOS__ It sounds like you couldn't let the novel get in the way when you were playing the character Rose.   ",1
53048," If you're just joining us, my guest is T.R. Reid. And we're talking about his new book, ""The Healing of America  A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care,"" and it's based on his travels around the world, looking at health care systems in other countries. __EOS__ Yeah, everybody in France knows this. They're thrilled about this. The World Health Organization did rate them number one, and you know, I went there. I can see why. It's a very good health care system. But in contrast, you remember we said the British system, the government provides the care and the government pays for the care. These Bismarck models on the continent of Europe and in Japan, they're all private. They're private docs, private hospitals and mainly private insurance plans. __EOS__ So are these insurance companies in this model that France has, are they for-profit companies like our for-profit insurance companies? __EOS__ No. No country that has insurance companies lets insurance companies make a profit on basic health insurance, and they have pretty strict rules. I mean, this is nice insurance. In Germany, for example, there are about 200 insurance companies. It's not single-payer. I want to make that point, 200 insurance companies. Anybody in Germany can buy any of the 200 company plans. If you don't like your insurance, guess what  You can drop it, shift to the next guy, and the new guy can't raise your premium. Now, that's, you know, more choice than anybody in America has. These companies have to cover everybody. They have to pay every claim. They don't have all those people going through, saying sorry, we don't cover that. ",0
53049," Tom, we have time for one more, and I begged you to bring this in because the story is so unbelievable. __EOS__ Okay. Well, you remember the guy who wrote ""Peter and the Wolf,"" right? __EOS__ Prokofiev. __EOS__ Sergei Prokofiev. Well, this is Sergei Prokofiev's grandson, Gabriel Prokofiev, who is a performer, a DJ, a composer. ",2
53050," You become numb to it eventually, but I would never call it business as usual. And in fact, the post-blast mission is one that only really developed as the war went on. When I initially went through EOD school, there was no section of the training that was called post-blast investigation.__EOS__ So what kind of evidence would you look for at the site of an IED explosion?__EOS__ Anything that would tell you how it was made, what the target was, if there was a key identifying feature that would link it to one bomber or another, or one group or another. So that's anything from the color of the wire used to connect the battery to the blasting cap, to getting an explosive sample of the type of explosives used, to collecting the VIN number on the car, to getting DNA samples of the people who were there so maybe you could identify which one the bomber was.__EOS__ But this isn't like going to, like, a crime scene after the fact, where you're slowly getting evidence and putting it in plastic bags. You are going to the site of explosions, and there are screaming people all around you, and you're going through body parts, basically, like looking for evidence of what happened in the explosion.",3

53052," In the late '20s, when he began to seriously resume his political career, what kind of mobility did he have? How much of his day did he spend in a wheelchair?__EOS__ Roosevelt would use a wheelchair only for a minute or two at a time, when he was moving around in his home or at the office. If he had to go from one room to another, he would have his personal assistant help him into the wheelchair. They would scoot over to the next room or down the hall, and then he would do this move that they called the flip to transfer himself into a comfortable chair, a desk chair or an armchair.__EOS__ We're speaking with James Tobin. His book is ""The Man He Became  How FDR Defied Polio to Win the Presidency."" 1928 was a presidential election year. At this point Franklin Delano Roosevelt was clearly a public figure. And he again gives a nominating speech for Al Smith at the party's national convention in Houston. How did he physically manage that?__EOS__ Well, four years earlier he had used crutches in New York City. Now in Houston all the delegates see him walking across this platform, much more sort of confidently. He's got only one crutch this time and holding an assistant's arm with the other. He gives another wonderful speech, and they say, so is this guy ready to run or not? He looks good to us. We think he's ready.",0
53053,"  Swing it on out there. Nah, nah.  in the state of Carolina . __EOS__ Fats Waller was one of the country's most prolific piano composers and a beloved entertainer. A new CD collection of his work was released this week. NPR's Karen Grigsby Bates listened to it and has this report. __EOS__ Dan Morgenstern is director of the Institute of Jazz at Rutgers University, and he's been a Fats Waller fan for decades. In 1938, he was barely nine years old, settling in the life in Denmark after his family fled Hitler's to Austria. As a treat, his mom took him into a concert hall in Copenhagen one evening. That's where he got his first eyeful of Fats - all 6' 2” and 285 pounds of him. __EOS__ I've never seen anybody remotely like him, and of course he was an electrifying performer. And even though I didn't understand more than a few words of anguish, it was very easy to understand what he was communicating. And one of the things that he communicated was the tremendous beat that he had. ",2
53054," I wanted to create a kind of get-off-the-hook list for people like me who see a list and feel like they have to do everything on it. So this is a book where you don't have to do everything. And some things on it, you couldn't do even if you wanted to try. __EOS__ Catherine Price has written for the New York Times and Salon. Now, she's conjured up 101 places that should be scratched off everybody's bucket list. __EOS__ Tell us about  what are the worst places to sleep? __EOS__ Well, I guess I had a couple on the list. But one that springs to mind is just the general concept of any hotel that used to be a prison. And there's one of those in Latvia. Karosta Cietums is the phonetic pronunciation. And it's basically this former Soviet-era prison in Latvia that now has been opened up as a hotel. ",0
53055," I don't know if I could put it in one word. I would say to entertain the audience and satisfy myself. __EOS__ Roger Corman, thank you very much for joining us. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ The new DVD series, ""Roger Corman's Cult Classics,"" is out now. And for more Corman lore, including the psychedelic research he did for the 1967 film ""The Trip,"" go to npr.org. ",1
53056," Well, no, that's all right. Never doubt me again, though.__EOS__ No, that's the whole point. You want to start off with giving people certain assumptions that they think they know what they're going to get. And once you sort of get them comfortable into a place where they think they know where everything is going, you jog the ride a little bit and then you jog it a little bit more. And then you just shake them as hard as you can until they realize that they're going to get what they expected they were going to get, which is good.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ If you're going to make this a novel-length book, you have to do something more with it. You have to expand on the concept. You have to actually involve the reader in the lives of the characters. Otherwise, it becomes, as you said, pastiche and parody, and that gets old very, very quickly.",0
53057," Well, it's also that I think there was some sort of combined, you know, live action plus animation. I don't think ""Our Friend the Adam"" was played by any individual. Let's put it that way. __EOS__ I don't know. I think I recognized Jonathan Winters under all that makeup. __EOS__ That was the voice, that was the voice, that's different. But it's also, I mean, you're talking about this festival and of course, you have to give out awards, but who would get the director award as you noted in your story. Alan Smithy would not put his name on this picture. __EOS__ Alan Smithy is the name that directors use when they hated the product, they were disgusted with what came out the other end because of the studio or other factors. And it was one of those names. I think Richard Widmark started it. He wanted nothing to do with it, so Alan Smithy was the name they threw up as director. Alan Smithy would back away from this project. But who knows? Who knows what kind of honors might be in the offing? ",3
53058," Well, we think there are probably - there are three pieces of this. First, they really think about their work as a system. They think and work as a system. The second thing is they focus on improving quality and reducing costs, and they use data to track their performance. They try to provide insight into what they're doing, using measures of quality and trying to reduce total costs. __EOS__ Doctor, there seems to be this sort of inverse relationship between quality and cost in the American health care system. And I'm interested in some of the work that you do in the Dartmouth Institute. You seem to have found that in some communities, where the quality of health care and of health outcomes are lowest, is where Medicare, for instance, is spending the most money. How does that happen? __EOS__ Well, why isn't more better? First, it often is. You know, there are certain treatments, like when you're having a heart attack, you want to get immediate and high quality care. And there are many high cost places that provide very high quality care for specific evidence-based conditions. __EOS__ I just want to understand something, because one of the things that really drives up health care cost is the overuse of medical care. How does that happen? ",3
53059," Well, actually, I was having a hard day, and so maybe this makes me an egomaniac, but I went on my own MySpace page to look at compliments that people had written. I thought, that'll buck me up. And then while I'm looking at them it's got these samples of songs, it's got a couple of whole songs, and ""Little Black Sandles"" started. And I was sort of lying there and suddenly I didn't like read the comments, I just sort of - it was the first time I've ever detached from something that like was mine and I pretended someone else was singing it to me. And I felt comforted. Isn't that really weird? __EOS__  Little black sandals are walking me away. Little black sandals, they're my  today. Now I'm free. Free of the big, bad giant who was stalking me. __EOS__ One of the tracks of the album is called ""Death by Chocolate."" Maybe we could just take a little listen to that. __EOS__  Death by chocolate is myth, yeah, yeah, yeah. This I know because I ate it. ",2
53060," We met with Robert Gibbs and two members of his staff last Thursday, more as a - we wanted to tell them we had the documents, but we also wanted to - we gave them a series of specific questions that came from the documents that we wanted to have answered. We wanted to actually speak to a - some senior White House officials about the documents, to sort of get their responses to what we were concluding from the documents. So we really - we did it for a more - to start a discussion about the documents and what they said. And then what happened was on, I believe it was Saturday or Sunday, the White House just sent us a few statements. __EOS__ What did you want to know? __EOS__ Well, the first question we had asked them was on Pakistan, was with - you know, in light of all this evidence, this very detailed evidence about Pakistan's spy service, how does the White House come out and continue to proclaim Pakistan to be an ally? And why does -how do you justify giving a billion dollars a year annually in military aid? I think it's a pretty straightforward question, because, you know, when you look at it, if you look at these documents, you see, you know, the spy service of your ally helping out the guys you're fighting in Afghanistan. And that does raise puzzling questions about why you're giving a billion dollars each year to Pakistan. So we kind of wanted to put that question bluntly to them. __EOS__ And what kind of response did you get? ",3
53061," Good. She hasn't. Well, knock wood for you, because when you're sued for libel...__EOS__ And this was the Westmoreland case that you're talking about.__EOS__ That's exactly right. For $120 million, CBS and among others, me, sued for libel and spent four months in a cold and drafty federal courtroom being called liar, cheat, fraud, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, that - I didn't realize what was happening, but I was sliding into a depression. My wife said, Mike, you're depressed. I'm not. I'm - and my own doctor said, no, don't you talk about yourself and depression. It would be bad for your image, Mike. Can you imagine?__EOS__ Well, let me ask you. You say some people warned you that you couldn't talk publicly about your depression, it would be bad for your image.",3

Can't even hear myself think, you pour the Kool-Aid and then we drink. So much noise, so much chatter. Does the truth even matter? __EOS__ Are we thinking about anybody in particular on this one? __EOS__ Well, you know, obviously the word reload... __EOS__ Anybody in particular come to mind here?

53064," I do, I do. I mean, I think it's also the nature of the election. You know, I feel like I want to have a voice in that. So I want to - I feel like I want ""Totally Biased"" to be a part of the discussion of the election.__EOS__ Now since your show is so political, I just want to ask you, this is the week when the American consulate in Libya was attacked, and our ambassador there and three other people were killed. How do you do your show in the shadow of that?__EOS__ You know, I mean, we have a lot of writers on the staff who are also deeply embedded in politics, and a lot of the things that come out of the show come out of discussions in the writers' room.

And then from those discussions emerge an angle that is comedic.__EOS__ This was after the murders at the Sikh temple.",3
53065," It sure does. And it looks that way that - again, it began with, say, rock musicians, and there are movements afoot from rock musicians themselves to help us become aware of hearing damage. But young people who listen to music at rock concert levels, which is about 130 decibels, almost surely have some kind of damage, and the younger you are when you damage your hearing, Ira, the worse it's going to be over time because you may continue to lose things through the aging process, but in addition to that you're probably going to be cranking up the volume just to compensate for the hearing loss in your youth, and you'll just speed up the process. __EOS__ Is there, and this may be a little bit far a field of your range, but talking about noise and isolation - are we in a generation where people who are in this generation are losing their interaction with the rest of the world because they're so clammed up inside these, you know, these ear pods? __EOS__ I think that's a part of it. One effect I've noticed, if you're standing in a checkout line, there are certain norms and customs you follow. Most people try not to look at the driver's license of the person writing the check, for example, and we all just bide our time, but when that cell phone rings and someone pulls it out, they are no longer in that little society. They're suddenly talking to the person on the other end of the cell phone, often quite loudly, and once they have crossed that line, you know, they don't seem to go back, and that sends a signal to everyone else that that's the rule of fair play now and it tends to only go up. __EOS__ You think we'll have laws against noise pollution? ",0
53066," In all, we have 500 students. __EOS__ It's one to have a dream, another to act on it. For Ramzi, the spark from dream to action was something he had noticed on visits to schools in France. How the children would draw musical instruments, trees, blue sky. __EOS__ And when I came here in 2002, I saw the children drawing tanks and guns. __EOS__ And here I just say, wow. And I say, okay. I will try to do some music for these kids. After that, I did, like, small concerts for them in the workshop. And some of them drew, tried to draw an instrument, you know, in half an hour, you know. And I say, it is really very strong, the music. ",2

53069," Julie Smith's New Orleans is full of secrets. The most famous detective she's invented, Skip Langdon of New Orleans Police Homicide, makes a living out of exposing those secrets. Skip is a tall, large woman who feels slightly out of place in her own body and her home of New Orleans. Smith says she represents her adolescent self, although they both obviously love the city they live in, in spite of its flaws. __EOS__  Yet despite crime and corruption, New Orleans remains, arguably, the most beautiful American city, the most gracious, the most charming. It is also the most eccentric. Walker Percy, one of its most revered writers, noted that here, the tourist is apt to see more nuns and naked women than he ever saw before, the combination being the intriguing part. __EOS__ Smith says that everyone is welcome in New Orleans, as long as they're not boring. On a hot, sticky day in July, Smith sits her hat on her head and ventures out into the city she loves and the secrets it hides, and how those secrets are inevitably revealed in a place where everyone seems to know everyone. __EOS__ It is a city and a village at the same time. It's like there are only half-a-dozen people living here. Nobody has any secrets from anybody -although they do. It's just that eventually, everybody finds them out. ",0
53070," When you fly now, if you're not flying to a major city through a nonstop flight, you're likely to fly to a major city that's a hub and then get on a smaller plane to the actual final destination you're going to.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ Why does this hub system work for airlines?__EOS__ The hub system creates lots of efficiencies. Essentially what it does is it can load large numbers of people from lots of small points into one big corridor between the major cities - the hub-to-hub route. So essentially it'll take you from, you know, Madison, Wisconsin, will put you to Chicago and then from Chicago to Tokyo, where the airlines are making their real money, and then in Tokyo somebody will take you to some other city in Japan. So the idea is efficiency. Hubs create efficiency until, of course, they become dysfunctional, in which case they cause delays and you can have real problems.",0
53071," My hair just grows. I come from a family that - you know I don't have the patience - I don't have the patience, nor the time to go to a barbershop and get a cut every three seconds. So, my hair just grows. It's always been problematic for me. It's just - thank God, it's in style now. Imagine me trying to get through this hairstyle in the late '80s and the early '90s, you know? Back then, I could do a flattop thing. But, nom I just -  I just keep it. It's my crown, you know, sort of symbolic now. But, yeah, it was a problem back in the day. You know, people staring at me like oh my God. You know, now it's a no thing because everyone has it. __EOS__ And besides, you're you, so… __EOS__ Yeah, exactly. __EOS__ You can do it now. ",2
53072," Mm-hmm. __EOS__ And what would be going through your head? __EOS__ I'm doomed, doomed, doomed is what was going through my head. And sometimes what would be going through my head would be, how about this? How about this? How about this? And then, I'd sit down and take a few notes and eventually go back home and make another pass at it. __EOS__ How hard was it for you at the end to put Lillian Leyb aside? ",0
53073," OK. Your father's enterprise was really profitable. Talk about some of the ways that he hid his assets, stashed money. __EOS__ Oh, he had many hiding places. He had legitimate bank accounts under other family members' names. And what he would do is, he'd let them keep the interest. __EOS__ And he also had this fascinating getaway plan, right, in case he was in a jam. Tell us about that. __EOS__ Well, the getaway plan was, you know, he had about 11, 12 different identities, credit cards, drivers' license from different states. And he had a van that he had about $300,000, $400,000 stashed in the walls of the van. He had a spot set up where - actually, more than one spot set up under different names in different cities in case he had to hide. ",0
53074," ...with two very different requirements - shall we say - for their public appearances. But do you expect there to be trends, fashion trends, that these women will then put forward that then will be copied by other people? It is worth noting that, you know, the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, does buy ready-to-wear.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ And then when she, things that she buys often become quite popular.__EOS__ I suspect that the Duchess of Cambridge, whatever she wears, if it is off the rack, there will be runs on everything that she wears that is in any way shape or form affordable and attractive. I fully expect that Kim Kardashian will be launching a maternity wear brand at any moment.",3
53075," As unusual as Coleman's music may be, his roots are very traditional. He was born in 1930 in Fort Worth, Texas, where the music he first heard came from the blues bands of the day. While still a teenager, he was playing in the horn sections behind guitarists like Pee Wee Crayton. __EOS__  I'm no country boy, runnin' wild in this big old town... __EOS__ Fort Worth, Texas - it's a little, small city and all the bands that were going to California had to travel through Texas. You name them, I've had experience with playing with them. It was music from heaven. __EOS__ Coleman eventually fell under the spell of bebop and migrated to Los Angeles in 1949. ",2
53076," Well, I think that's a very good question. I mean, she, Frances Moore Lappe was saying, look, we're eating too high on the food chain. We're eating all this corn-fed beef. We still are. There are some better alternatives out there than there were back when she wrote that book in the ‘70s. And that is, you know, there's some real good news here, too, and that is that there's a very lively grass-finished beef industry starting up. __EOS__ Thank you for calling, Vivian. __EOS__ There's a great farmer here on Long Island who has, grows potatoes, uses biodiesel from some of his crop and makes the cake, the potato chips he makes he uses for biodiesel to run the machinery for his farm. __EOS__ There are a lot of farmers really trying to close the loop here. And one of the things I tried to do in this book was find what I think is the most sustainable farmer in America. And there are people doing some incredibly greater work in getting us off of fossil fuel food. ",0
53077," Hi, Don. __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ Don, go ahead. __EOS__ Yeah. I was just going to say I'm a kind of a different type of individual. I was underground for nine years and I really enjoyed it.

53078," I don't know if this is so much about manners as it is about kind of more generally connecting, but you know, etiquette is about connecting, isn't it - so, and how to connect appropriately so that you don't kind of scare the other person off. So I don't know, Karen, what you think?__EOS__ Well, I think it's about connection and it's about comfort level. And the first thing I thought of when I read Alfonzo's letter is that he maybe is being a little too intense. You know, if you don't know someone very well and you come on very strongly because you like them a lot - and I think everybody's had this experience - it makes the object of your affection go whoa. So he maybe needs to dial it back several notches.__EOS__ Steven, what do you think? And you know I have to ask whether you think the same rules apply for people in same-sex relationships too.__EOS__ Well, I was just going to say on this one, you know, it sounds like he needs a little more emotional intelligence.

And, you know, if they had just met, you know, say two or three weeks ago and, you know, I got this handcrafted Valentine's Day card that said I love you, I'd probably like go running. So, you know, you need to, you know, you really need to sort of understand the tea leaves there. And I think there's more going on here than we were led on. So...",3
53079," Well, Rita is quite Joan of Arc. I think I've been quite lucky. There are so many and also ones I haven't even thought about. __EOS__ Well, I won't force you to choose. __EOS__ It's such a vague answer, isn't it? I'm very sorry. Very unsatisfying. But give me a little bit. __EOS__ Sally Hawkins, all the best to you. ",1
53080," And when you say people of color, we're talking Asians, we're talking Latinos, not just black folk. __EOS__ Yeah. And I would actually say that for Asian Americans in general, it's almost kind of a wasteland as far as the Academy Awards are concerned. __EOS__ Kamal, if the Academy Awards do turn out to be basically all white this year, do you think it sends a particular message to the film industry that that's acceptable, or do you think the message more goes to the public? __EOS__ I think it goes to the industry that it's more acceptable. I mean this happens over and over again, where they throw a bone one year and then just take all our toys away the next. I mean, ""The Color Purple,"" prime example. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, won zero. ",3
53081," One of the things about this film, a lot of what we're seeing is actors... __EOS__ Acting. __EOS__ I was going to say reacting and reflecting. A lot it's not what they're saying. It's what you're seeing in their faces. Does that require a different kind of directing? __EOS__ The stillness between lines, it creates tension. It creates its own kind of tension. And I think that doesn't always - there doesn't always have to be words there for a scene to work. Again, you have to have the actors who can pull that off. ",1
53082," ...on the mean streets... __EOS__ That's right. __EOS__ ...of South Central. __EOS__ Along the way, the Youth tries on a lot of different masks while looking for his true self. Director Annie Dorsen says the Youth would rather write a song about loving the girl than actually love the girl. ",2
53083," I had read the first two, but that was it. I wasn't nearly the sort of fanatic that a lot of other people who were auditioning were, and which is why I think there were quite a few people that were pissed off when I got the part. And I said in my first press conference 'cause I was 10 or 11 or whatever, and I was just like oh, you know, I don't, I've only read the first two and, you know, and of course, there was some, you know, person writing in the newspaper the other day going, how dare they not pick a true fan for the thing? And you just go, oh Jesus.__EOS__ So you'd never studied acting but you got this incredible on set education. Did each of the actors and the directors kind of share with you the type of training that they got? Were you exposed to everybody's training?__EOS__ Not really. No. I mean there's, you don't have time like on a film set to, like, train a kid up at the same time as doing your own job. You know, there's no, so really, it's just about it was I think so it was on us to watch and learn. Alan Rickman is not suddenly going to, you know, take timeout of his day to talk to you about something, you know, when you've got a shot to get, or whatever. I mean Alan has actually incidentally, been an incredibly supportive person in my life and has come to see me in every theater endeavor I've done and, you know, has been amazing. Actually, he's since Potter has taught me huge amounts. But it's not always, you know, you're on a film set, everyone's there to do a job, so it's not always, you know, the first thing on everyone's mind would be to like oh, let's, you know, give these kids a theatrical education while we're here.__EOS__ So you were a child actor with a lot of young fans - and older fans as well. But, you know, I think particularly like film fans in general but I think, you know, children who were fans in particular, have trouble differentiating between the actor and the character. So...",1

But no, he is part of the natural world just like all of us, and he is a ruthless little predator. __EOS__ And I have a couple Jack Russell dogs, and my boys have hamsters, Siberian hamsters, which they love, and they're good pets. They're good fun. __EOS__ Alright. Well, thank you both so much. And congratulations on the film. __EOS__ Thank you very much. Very nice to have such a nice chat. ",1

Why did you want to come here?__EOS__ I had started - I was supposed to be a doctor in Nigeria. So I had started studying medicine. I did well in school. When you do well in school, they tell you you have to be a doctor. And I did that for a year and a half, and I was very unhappy. And my sister, who had been born here when my father was - my father got his Ph.D. in statistics at Berkeley, and my sister had been born here in the '60s, so she was a dual citizen, American and Nigerian, and she'd come here.__EOS__ Wait, why couldn't you stay in Nigeria and major in literature?",0
53086," Onstage, Cary Ann and Michael play all the instruments - they switch off on guitars and drums and keyboard and harmonica, all the while singing together in perfect harmony.__EOS__ To reduce the music down to what two people can accomplish and giving yourself that kind of narrow spectrum to work with, that's kind of what our cooperation is a study in - minimalism is making a grand noise.__EOS__  I'm going down a long road, maybe it's the wrong road. Either way I got to find my way back home again.__EOS__ For a while, this couple shared quite a small space - they converted the 15-seat van Michael toured in with his old band into a mobile home for two. They took out the seats and they built a little loft in the back.",2
53087," Well, it was a million-to-one shot, but he actually met a tantric yogi in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1889. Perry Baker was 13 years old and had been sent there by his family to learn the building trades. However, he was interested in nothing but the occult arts and occult literature, and ended up meeting a fellow named Silveus Hamadi, who was a Syrian-Indian practitioner and teacher of hatha yoga and tantric yoga. __EOS__ So this kid, Perry Baker, sort of taken under the wing, under his tutelage, of this Indian emigre. How does that unfold? I mean, does he just start to study under him day after day, week after week, year after year? __EOS__ He becomes the chela in the guru-chela relationship, which is the guru-student relationship, and basically stays with Hamadi for the next 18 years. __EOS__ And they didn't think it was unusual? I mean, we are still talking about Lincoln, Nebraska, in the late 19th century. ",3
53088,"  Hey, I like the song, and I think Lucas Davenport would      like the song. __EOS__   I want a man with a slow hand.  I want a      lover with an easy touch.  I want somebody who will spend some time, not      come and go... __EOS__  Do you think you know what Lucas Davenport likes? __EOS__  Yeah, I do, because in some cases, you have to base it to      some extent on yourself or you'll forget about him.  So Lucas and I have      almost no characteristics in common, but he is my height, for example,      and he has my eye color because then I don't have to remember that.  And      I, quite frankly, find great joy--I go on one road trip every year--last      year, I drove all the way up to the north coast of Alaska, up in the      Arctic Ocean--and you got to have the right music to go on a road trip.      And there's nothing like driving across the prairie and going from one      little radio station to the next and hearing all these different kinds of      music.  It's just--I mean, it's one of the things I enjoy most in life,      and I think Lucas would, too. ",0
53089,"  Oh it's easy. It's just like talking except louder and longer and you move your voice up and down. __EOS__  I can sing but I just choose not to sing. Especially in front of other people. __EOS__  Well, if you sing alone you can sing in front of other people. There's no difference. __EOS__  Actually there's a big difference. ",2
53090," Right. Or - it actually happens to us all day long. It's so ordinary that people don't even notice it. But the quickest way I can show it is, it's that same thing when you're walking down the street and suddenly, you know, down through - past the bakery, you smell the smell and there's your Aunt Carol's kitchen... __EOS__ Mm-hmm. __EOS__ ...and it just comes flooding back. That is an, I think, an extraordinary event, because what happens is the time that you're in, the real time where you're walking down the street is somehow taken over by this flood of this other time in your past that you didn't ask for. And it comes and if -when I say to people, particularly when I'm teaching writing. Because in my feeling now, writing and drawing aren't that different than any - they're not different from each other. __EOS__ Sure. ",0
53091," Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Gayle in Columbiaville. Hi, Gayle. __EOS__ Oh, hi. Thank you. I listen to your show. I'm really enjoying. It's rewarding. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ I'm always right on the edge of making cheese at home but I'm afraid of it. ",0

After that, he went to Europe, and his career began to      take off, braces, crutches and all. __EOS__  When you have to conduct and that's the way you get      onstage, it's the way you get onstage.  You just do what you have to do      in order to make it work. __EOS__  But his physical troubles didn't end with polio.  In the late      1990s, De Preist contracted kidney disease and had to go on dialysis.      This time, he thought of giving up conducting.  Then came September 11th,      2001.  As the twin towers were coming down, he got a call from Susan      Baumgardner, a fan, a woman he had briefly encountered 10 years before. __EOS__  My experience with him was just so wonderful that      I thought, `I'm going to try to give him a kidney.'  And it was the      easiest, biggest decision I've ever made in my life.  I felt like if I      could help him, that would be helping bring more music to the world. ",2
53093," All of it. __EOS__ All of it. __EOS__ I mean, the melodies, everything. It comes to me very - it's not an easy thing. It's very, very hard. I have to do a tremendous amount of work before I can really feel somewhat comfortable for it. And... __EOS__ So what do you do to learn a song? ",2
53094," It does get recycled. That's the good part of it is more - that plastic bags are theoretically recyclable but it doesn't actually tend to happen and those types of bags are fairly long-lived and that some of the forms of plastic that find their way in the oceans are is the very plastic that is contained in grocery bags. So both of them have real negatives attached. So it's the correct answer, which you've already pointed out, is neither...__EOS__ ...if you really want to have the best solution. You know, one of the guys I write about in the book is the founder of a company called ChicoBags and he's one of the many reusable grocery bag manufacturers. He calls plastic bags the gateway drug to waste, and then if you can start small in your personal waste habits and just eliminate that part of it, it's the way to get started in being less wasteful. If you can use a reusable bag 11 times, its footprint will be lower than a plastic grocery bag. That's all it takes is using it 11 times. So he makes a pretty good case for the just sticking one of these in your pocket or your purse or whatever. Don't leave it in the car because it'll just stay in the car. You actually have to have it attached to you in some way.__EOS__ That's been my experience. Yeah.__EOS__ So OK, but like I say, on those days when I'm not a good person and I don't have my reusable bags with me, am I better off with plastic or paper or are they both just really bad choices?",0
53095," People were surprised when I arrived and sort of tested it as an idea because it's one of Shakespeare's plays that people don't know so well. And if they do, they often find it very difficult. But I have this feeling that if you were to clear away all the dense passages and shorten it and edit it, you're left actually with a very visceral, sinewy, political thriller with this extraordinary mother/son dynamic at the center of it.__EOS__ He is a terrifying character.__EOS__ Mm-hmm.__EOS__ And the way you portray him quite possibly makes him even more terrifying. I want to just play a clip from the film.",1
53096," Well, that was the initial six-point plan, but that's been - I mean yesterday in the meeting of E.U. foreign ministers the whole approach was beefed up a bit. But we are concerned about what the settlement will look like, obviously, and for us it's vitally important that Russian troops get out of Georgia, especially given the horror stories we hear of their behavior. __EOS__ Before I let you go, does what you're seeing in Georgia this week, despite your very vocal opposition to it and that of other leaders of countries that used to be in the Soviet Union, does it in some way threaten to alter policy, even if subtly, and make people feel we should be more cautious, we should do nothing that might be so reckless as to give Moscow a pretext to bully us? __EOS__ Maybe in some quarters, but as I've said, I think what we're in for is a very long-term debate and discussion on European security, given that the fundamental assumption we had was wrong, and I think that Secretary Rice, in calling together the NATO ministerial for next Tuesday, the first point that will be discussed is Georgia, and the second one is NATO relations with Russia after what has happened. I think that will be the core debate for quite a while. __EOS__ President Ilves, thank you very much for talking with us. ",3
53097," Thank you, Jacki. It's nice to be with you. __EOS__ Would you please tell us a little bit more about Juana of Castile? I don't like to call her Juana the Mad, even though I realize she was known that way during her lifetime. It reminded me, the whole tale, of a dark fairy tale with a princess locked in a tower, only she's never rescued.  __EOS__ Yes. Well, Juana was a woman of many talents. She wasn't raised to be queen because she was third in the line of succession, and so her mother wanted her to be intelligent and she gave her a very good tutor. And she was a very beautiful woman, so she was betrothed to Philippe the Fair when she was 16 years old. __EOS__ Betrothed. ",0
53098," I want to bring up something that I don't think you write about in the book, and this had a big impact on you professionally. And I think it's possible it relates to what we were talking about in terms of inappropriate behavior that you've... __EOS__ I think I know where you're going. __EOS__ Yeah, you know where I'm driving. __EOS__ A couple of years ago, when you were a music critic at the Washington Post, you were - you wrote a very inappropriate email to one of Marion Barry's aides, and you were on their, like, email list for their press releases and stuff, and you wanted to get off of it. And do you mind if I just quote the line that you wrote? ",3

It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor...__EOS__ Oskar Eustis, at the Public Theater, heard it and suggested Byrne take his idea to risk-taking director Alex Timbers, of ""Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson"" fame.

He didn't certainly instruct his employees to cheat, and he had nothing to do with it.__EOS__ He basically said that - also, that there was - there were a lot of jealousies from his winning, and he was an outsider.

You know, I remember I was always the kid that got lost in, like, the shopping mall or, like, I got lost in Santa Cruz, you know, walking the boardwalk when I was, like, five or six.

He's on the street, like a downtown Los Angeles street and the rain's flooding down him. He's buckled over, just in agony of the melody. It's a sort of turning point in the movie so he realizes he's a man and the Muppet guy, Walter, realizes he's a Muppet. So it's a crucial moment in the movie as well.__EOS__ Of them finding their real identity.",2
53106," Yeah. I mean, I know the references for sure. I have vague recollections of those kinds of programs, and in the script it was just ""The Tonight Show,"" but John really would improv quite a bit and really make Buck even farther than what he initially was and would come up with references like Dinah and Jim Nabors and stuff like that. And Ricky Jay of course picked up on that right away and it went running. __EOS__ So what was your role in getting this movie made? __EOS__ Well, really it was just sort of - Sean and I met. We spent a great deal of time trying to get financing for the movie, which was kind of a difficult thing to do because we didn't have a Buck Howard at that time. And of course if you don't have a Buck Howard, then you don't have your money, but you can't get money without having a Buck Howard. So there's a little conundrum there. And someone had suggested Playtone, which is my father's production company along with Gary Goetzman. And that wasn't necessarily my idea, and it wasn't necessarily something I was super-keen on, but obviously I know everybody there and I admire their tastes very much. __EOS__ Uh-huh. ",3
53107," Well, I mean some of them were incapable of speech. It was a great sort of crowded room and in the corner of it, a woman sitting with her child, saying nothing. What the men told me very often, it was that they had been - in the middle of the night - attacked by ISIS. ISIS tends to move around with Humvees which it's captured from armed forces in Iraq and Syria. And the local Yazidis often have served in the Iraqi army. They can fight and they had a bit of ammunition and they fought off ISIS for a while alongside the Kurdish Peshmerga. But the ISIS began to use mortars and the Kurdish Peshmerga retreated and at that point the Yazidis started to run, as well. And what they told me - I mean there was one old man who I think had been carried a large part of the way - that they'd had to run for 25 miles, let's say, up and down hills until they'd reached safety. And ISIS came after them, you know, shooting at them. Not necessarily wanting to kill them all. What they wanted to do was drive them out, which they succeeded in doing, of course, but seizing the women. And one man I met - a policeman, as it happens - had been engaged in the battle against ISIS. He then came back towards his home when the ranks broke, if you like. And what he found was ISIS had just got there before him and were bundling his wife into a car. And he never saw her again.__EOS__ That's so horrible. Obviously, it was really important to you to visit Yazidis who had fled from ISIS. It was probably a dangerous trip for you. Tell us a little bit about going and why you were willing to take the risks.__EOS__ I obviously feel quite passionately about what's happening there and I very much want to understand what's going on there so that - to be able to advise people better back here. And you know, a sense of debt. I learned much from them. I like and enjoyed learning about their religion and I felt such a sense of tragedy that these people whom I had befriended had undergone this terrible suffering. So I went back to northern Iraq and you know, it's never good to go to a place where all the airlines are basically refusing to fly. But it was - it's a rather eerie place because the front line is so undefined. It is not clear. You look out at a place, it looks very peaceful. We were taken to the front line. We were shown a car on the other side of the river which was perhaps an ISIS car, it certainly was on their side of the river. And you feel - here is a very tranquil place. It doesn't look like there's anything going on. But actually, of course, at any moment it may happen or it may not. They come quite suddenly and they attack very suddenly. A lot of people are so afraid of them that because of their atrocities, which are actually quite calculated, everyone runs away when they approach. And so what they can do is, they don't need to deploy great numbers. They can create a huge sensation just by sending a few cars and everyone runs because they know the story of what happened to the Yazidis. And that, I'm afraid is - you know, I was somewhat baffled by why they'd done what they'd done to the Yazidis because it didn't seem strategically useful. But when you think of it in those terms, I'm afraid that's why they did it - in order, quite simply, to terrorize. And it has made them - it's been effective, in those terms.__EOS__ What are the odds, do you think, that this religion will survive?",0
53108," Oh, gosh. __EOS__ I... __EOS__ That's not real funny in a way, you know? __EOS__ ...so... ",1
53109,"  One of the things you had to learn how to do in Iraq was to pray like a Sunni.  What's the difference between how the Shia and Sunni pray?  What did you have to learn? __EOS__  The prayer that Shias and Sunnis recite is the same.  But what sets them apart is the hand gestures and the body gestures of the prayer.  The Shias place their hands on the side of their body as they pray, and when they kneel on the ground and place their foreheads as a sign of submission to God, they place their foreheads on a compact soil.  It's this round stone-shaped clay object.   __EOS__  One of the things that you write about in your book is your relationship with your partner, Babak, and you have a lot in common.  You met in a war zone in Afghanistan.  He was covering the war in Iraq for Newsweek, you for the Wall Street Journal, and you both spent the first 10 years of your life in Iran and left with your families for the United States. After that, reading your book, I couldn't help but think, it must intensify a relationship to begin that relationship and continue it in a war zone while you're covering for the press - you for the Wall Street Journal, he for the Newsweek. __EOS__  It was definitely an intense experience to go through with my partner, Babak.  It was interesting to be based in both Afghanistan and Iraq at the same time.  We know we went through life and death situations together.  We had to deal with a lot of the same emotional issues, difficult decisions and dealing with the staff in coverage.  And I think it was also very helpful because there was a sense that your partner understands what you're going through, and you can relate to them.  So, in that sense, I felt like I was very lucky to have him.  Also, it was a crazy place to be, and it was just nice at the end of the day to be able to kind of relax and have your partner near you and have dinner or talk and have at least a little bit of a normalcy. ",0
53110," I'm not aware of that actually. What I like about is he knows he's losing the argument and he's getting more and more frustrated, and therefore more and more pushy and trying, you know, every Hail Mary he can to get in there and reason. And to the point where he almost insults his boss and he's got no other cards to play, and maybe that's the smirk - it's a no-win situation.__EOS__ Part of his character, part of his charm is that he just clearly doesn't have a well-rounded life. He's obsessed with work, he's divorced. He tries to stay in touch with his daughter. But this is a guy who is consumed with work.__EOS__ Well-rounded is not necessarily my concern. I like him for the fact that he - you know, his idiosyncrasies, that he can't watch the games without getting too emotional, that he's often has food down his shirt, he tends to break a few chairs now and then. I mean, these things make him human. These things make him interesting to me.__EOS__ It occurs to me that, as a movie viewer, that it was quite lucky for you that your character doesn't watch the game. Because if he did, I mean as the general manager, he'd just be sitting there helpless. But instead, your character can sprawl out in the weight room. He can get in a truck and drive around. He could turn the radio on. He could turn it off with a key pitch. There are things for you to do as an actor you couldn't do in the stands.",1
53111," America and Pakistan are two countries that'll be intertwined for all kinds of reasons and quite likely for many, many decades now. Whether we're talking about diplomats or journalists or tourists or authors, what don't Americans get about Pakistan? __EOS__ Pakistan now is like a horror film franchise. You know, it's ""Friday the 13th, Episode 63  The Terrorist from Pakistan."" And each time we hear of Pakistan, it's in that context. The thing about Pakistan is Pakistan, in a way, looks like the world. It's a diverse group of multi-ethnic, multi-linguistic, multi-religious people who are doing all sorts of different things, you know  being teenagers, being lovers, being writers, being farmers. __EOS__ Mohsin Hamid, thank you very much for coming in to talk to us. __EOS__ Thank you.

It's about letting go of things, because it only brings you down, ridding yourself of anything that's holding you back.__EOS__ When you sing - watching you sing here, you're very present, but almost like you're watching yourself. There's - you are emoting. I mean, you cannot sing this material without going somewhere very deep.",2

53115," When you are trying to prevent risky eating behaviors and curiosity surrounding these in your children, and risky Internet use behaviors, I think it's always helpful to talk to your children. So, that would be the first thing. The other thing is I would perceive - I would think of the Web as a social media, and I try to explain to parents that if they wouldn't feel comfortable with their child going out of their home at 11 o'clock at night and meeting people that their parents have never met in the middle of the night, that they may want to think about whether or not their child should have access to the Internet late at night in their room alone, and that that may be something that they want to do together for a while and introduce them to it in a graded way. But that requires a significant amount of Internet savviness on the part of parents, and I think that many parents are sort catching up to their kids on this. __EOS__ Dr. Rebecka Peebles specializes in eating disorders at Stanford University. Thank you, Rebecka. __EOS__ Thank you. __EOS__ My mom was watching ""Oprah,"" and they were talking about pro-ana sites, and they had a young girl on there, and she talked about how much they helped her, and without listening any more of the interview that was going on, I went into the computer room and jumped on the sites.

53116," Yes. I think it has, yes. I feel like I'm a little bit brave.__EOS__ You're allowed to say it.__EOS__ Yeah, I do.__EOS__ Well, you know, Ethan Hawke, you said something recently - I forget who you said it to - you said that the most difficult thing is to have self-confidence when you're perceived as having gone out of fashion.",1
53117,"  Jennifer, thanks for sharing it - first, with StoryCorps and then with us.  We appreciate it.   __EOS__  Thank you. __EOS__  All right, bye-bye. __EOS__  Bye. ",3
53118," Mm-hmm. __EOS__ You know, and I really think that that's where the lack of pride comes from. Seeing as, this realm isn't even real. So, it's really the realms of the form that we need to exist in, and really, pride has no place in that realm, because, you would have pride in earthly things which aren't even real. __EOS__ Hmm. __EOS__ And I really think that that's where Catholic roots, where Catholics get the putting down of pride.

53120," That is close to unprecedented. That being said, when a president comes into office, historically, all the U.S. attorneys leave, and he appoints a new set of these individuals — there are about 90 of them. And as you know, they are sort of in charge of federal enforcement in each of these districts. And they can be very powerful and influential in deciding which cases are prosecuted and which kinds of cases are not. __EOS__ Still, in all, a U.S. attorney is a political appointee, serves at the pleasure of the president. Would it then be a reasonable thing, even though unusual? If they don't like the job they're doing, they don't like the job. __EOS__ The president has the right to do this. The question comes up, was the administration really directly trying to influence the enforcement of law? And that would, you know, verge on improper - quite serious improper. __EOS__ Why are U.S. attorney posts important enough for the White House, the media and Congress to be so focused on who holds these jobs and, in this case, who's been fired from these jobs? ",3
53121," Going to repair back to some of our questions now, because that brings up this question… __EOS__   Been so long since I belong here. __EOS__ ""Been So Long,"" a 1971 hit that you had with Hot Tuna. Now, that song is the opening track of your new album. __EOS__  Been so long since I belong here. Ever since I lost my way. That was when I still had something special left for me to say, unto you. ",2
53122," Well, just to figure out that I was having a situation that was serious enough to call for help took a very long time, because I, of course, as I mentioned, never had a stroke before, so I didn't know, you know, I should pick up the phone and call 911 immediately while 911 is still inside of my mind. But for me I kept shifting out into this experience of euphoria, totally detached from any ability to think about or relate to the external world. And it wasn't until my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side that I realized, oh my gosh, I'm having a stroke, because that was a warning sign, paralysis in your body, a warning sign of stroke. __EOS__ You're obviously a very verbal person. What was it like for you to be unable to speak or comprehend language? __EOS__ Well, in the beginning it was really shocking because when I would have a wave of clarity, I could hear myself saying clearly in my mind, this is Jill, I need help. This is Jill. I'm having a stroke. And - but when I tried to get my throat to make that sound, just waaaaaahhhh came out, and that was - I did not know that I could not speak until I tried to speak, and that was absolutely shocking to me. Because you have to remember through the eyes of neuroscientist, through the eyes of a neuro-anatomist, my area of specialty is knowing which cells are communicating with which cells, and what do those circuits look like. __EOS__ You mentioned that on the morning of your stroke, you kept drifting in and out of this state of euphoria, but that euphoria wasn't there after you got to the hospital and kind of awakened later in the day or the next day. Can you talk about what it was like after the euphoria was behind you, when you were in a body controlled by a brain that was severely damaged by the stroke? ",0

53125," As a child, it took Gyorgy Ligeti 20 minutes to walk to school from his home in Romanian Transylvania. Ligeti told the BBC as he walked, he would imagine concerts in his head. __EOS__ And from this kind of listening to inner fantasy, I very gradually developed a kind of possibility to - not only to imagine music, but to compose it. __EOS__ Ligeti's father wanted him to become a scientist, not a musician, so Ligeti was 14 before he learned how to properly compose the music he imagined. __EOS__ Then I just went in a shop, bought music paper and a pencil and a rubber and began to write a piece.

53126," I don't really engage with the questioning of the rule. I usually cut right to, well, I'm your father and it's time for you to have a timeout right now. And I try really hard not to get into discussions of the rule because my kid is pretty smart and she is in many cases a little lawyer. She's good at arguing with me about rules. And if I just say, you know what? What I'm saying is it is time for you to sit over here for three minutes. And that's usually enough. __EOS__ And is that effective?  __EOS__ It works pretty well. As long as it's not a case in which she asks for something and asks for something and then on the, you know, fourth or fifth try I say oh, OK, because that teaches something else, which is that evidently asking for something four times in a more and more strident tone is the way to get something.   __EOS__ Dad can be manipulated.

There he is,  pictured looking at them; and looking in awe at them, kind of being on the side of the aggressor.__EOS__  In that moment, I should have felt sorrow or anger, but all I felt was awe. What audacity!",1
53128," Rob, you didn't actually shoot in 16 mm?__EOS__ We did shoot in 16 mm.__EOS__ Wow - you did. Wow.__EOS__ We did. Yeah.",1
53129," Um-hum. __EOS__ But the reason it was just in that spot is a little hard to explain. Now that it's been there for a good long time, does it make sense now? __EOS__ It makes its own sense, and I think this is what initially got me so interested in the border is that, as I said, when the border is first created there is no there there. There's this somewhat arbitrary line drawn across a vast stretch of land. And then the border becomes this important space that draws people to it. People actually go to the border and establish towns, setting up ports of entry that monitor customs across the border. Then people decide to build businesses on the border in order to service those - the development of transporter trade. __EOS__ So the lesson is, in terms of borders, if you draw it, they will come.

There's people doing economic development.__EOS__ So what's the larger goal of the embassy?__EOS__ I mean, it's to secure American influence here. It was supposed to be the greatest - the largest embassy in the world. I think it still might be the biggest because of all the security guys. But, you know, they had this grand ambition in 2011 that the military was going to leave, and it was going to be replaced by this huge diplomatic army. And they quickly expanded the size of the diplomatic presence as the Americans were leaving. And then very quickly, like, within a month, they started reducing it because they never asked the Iraqis. They never went to the Iraqis and said, hey, is it OK that we have 16,000 people here now? Are you going to let us get our food into the country? You know, and they had all these problems.

53136," Well, I love that you bring up Lincoln as an example, because so many people admire him today, of course. But you also write in this book - this is a quote from the book, in the present tense, ""In 1865, he is by far the most despised and reviled president in American history."" What made him seem that way to a lot of people at the time?  __EOS__ Well, obviously, the South hated him, and many in the North just didn't want to make the sacrifice. There was a lot of racism in the North, obviously, and they said, why are we losing hundreds of thousands of people and fighting this bloody, prolonged war when we don't really care that much? __EOS__ Well, what made him a great leader, given that circumstance that so many people were opposed to him or anxious about the course that he was taking?  __EOS__ Two things  perseverance and compassion. Even in the darkest days, Lincoln didn't give up. He didn't panic. He stayed and he fought hard. And the compassion is demonstrated by Lincoln's - every week, Lincoln would accept correspondence from the regular folks. And I write in ""Killing Lincoln,"" it's an amazing situation.

53140," Sure. Over the past few decades, we've seen this tripling in the childhood obesity epidemic.

This issue would be much easier to fix if we had.__EOS__ So that's the body mass index. You followed 1,000 children from infancy to age 15. And you connected various factors with the child's body mass index, or the BMI. You're saying that the actual mothers working outside the home was a small part of it. What was a bigger part of it?__EOS__ Well, it's a small association between maternal employment and children's BMI but it's not maternal employment that's contributing to BMI per se. So we wanted to stress that - I know that people have a visceral reaction to this but it's not intended at all to be guilt-inducing.__EOS__ Well, you're saying it wasn't guilt.

A foul ball hitting the stands, you go for it, and you don't think about it. And I don't think it's his fault at all. __EOS__ Steve, thanks very much for the call. And, Alex Gibney, you said something important earlier that I wanted to follow up on. You said that Moises Alou, the left fielder, reached into the stands.

53143," You get this opportunity to do a graphic novel, an original piece of work in extended form, because you do write two very popular and successful and critically applauded regular series. __EOS__ Thank you, yeah. Y  The Last Man, which is sort of a political satire I guess you could call it, about gender politics, about the story of one man who survives a plague that kills all the other men but leaves the women behind. And Ex Machina, which is a political thriller about a retired superhero who runs for mayor of New York City. __EOS__ If you go out and buy the copy, you'll be pleased to know he's not entirely retired. And you do go back in his past to tell stories of his exploits, though he's not your classic superhero, is he? __EOS__ No, he's definitely not. And you know, he had the superheroic past and decided that, really, all he was doing is maintaining the status quo and thought that he could effect more change as a politician. So it's sort of a balance between sci-fi jet-pack action and boring political stuff, although I like the boring, political stuff. ",0
53144," Exactly. At 1 00 a.m. on January 13, 2006, two men wearing masks or hoods came walking down her property through this little orphanage where she kept her animals on the mend.

That's how bad crime had gotten there. __EOS__ Doesn't sound like a robbery. __EOS__ No, it doesn't. The police were convinced that it was a robbery, but all of her friends said and insisted that it was an assassination attempt because of her conservation activities on the lake. Four men were arrested. And then at the trial the judge said the evidence was virtually non-existent. They were essentially acquitted. __EOS__ What did Alan Root wind up doing with her ashes? ",0

It's terrible, in a way. ",1
53146," Well, I was going to ask you. You have to have these rigs, these unique rigs in order to create the unique taste. __EOS__ Well, not necessarily. I mean, you were again able to - we were able to replicate a lot of the recipes in the home oven. But what we're doing is encouraging people to go out there and build more rigs… __EOS__  more rigs. __EOS__ Yeah. Exactly. Just for a little more funk in their lives. I mean, you're not going to find architectural drawings in this book. You're not going to find perfect measurements or even suggestions of different equipment to buy. It's more we're encouraging people to do something wild and wacky, and not just again go for the traditional rigs that you can find at any superstore. ",0
53147," His wife has left him. She'd remarried. He's living alone in Greenwich Village. Even - he's propositioned  well, he slept with his secretary, which was a terrible thing to do, and then kind of ditches her and fires her. And then... __EOS__ To be fair, she resigns. __EOS__ She resigns, okay. Who would stay under those circumstances? And then also, I mean, even, like, you've even lost your touch with women. I mean, things are kind of getting back to an even keel. But, like, you've propositioned who've turned you down. It's kind of rough. __EOS__ Well, I think, what - again, as I say, this character is evolving. And what is happening is, in my opinion, and I think Matt Weiner, the show's creator, would agree with me, is that Don is sort of losing touch with not only his life but with the world around him.

53148,"  There's one thing about Black Rock - everybody is polite. That makes for a very gracious living. __EOS__  Nobody asked you here. __EOS__  How do you know? __EOS__ I did all kinds of work at MGM including handling pictures which were not yet pictures. They were screenplays which fell into a deep hole. They were not done well enough to have been shot and made into movies, and they were not done poorly enough to be simply burned. So they asked me to take a look at it, and that's what I did for a while. ",0
53149," Following Frank's performance, we asked him about playing the Tiny Desk.__EOS__ I thought it was a reasonably normal-sized desk, personally, but otherwise, it was a lot of fun.__EOS__ It's not so tiny, actually.__EOS__ Yeah. It was fun, though. It was good. I like doing stuff like that.",2
53150," Her favorite pieces were ""The Rite of Spring"" and - more so - ""The Firebird Suite.""__EOS__ We used to dance around to it, you know, like we were on a stage.__EOS__ It is a ballet - ""The Firebird"" - so we were sort of channeling that idea.__EOS__ So you heard it a lot?",2
53151," Did you choose ""Your Long Journey""? __EOS__ Yeah, I did choose that song. Another song that Stephen Bruton, by the way, had hipped me to. __EOS__ Wow. Is that by Doc and Merle Watson? because it has Watson and Watson on the credits. __EOS__ Doc and Rosalee, Doc's wife, wrote that, I think. ",1

At first, I took a lot of persuading to do it by Michael the director, and the same goes for Rob. It's very difficult to envisage it before you start doing it. You don't know what it's going to be about until you start making it. So there's a certain kind of insecurity that goes with that. ",1
53154," No, we were - there were many steps here.__EOS__ Yeah, many steps.__EOS__ We did a lot of demo recording with an eight-track cassette recorder that my brother brought me. And then we - right before we left in 1999, we recorded 10 songs in a studio in Abidjan. And that recording was lost. It was not backed up and destroyed.__EOS__ So you two begin this process in '97. Both of you left Ivory Coast in 1999, but those recordings were lost...",2
53155," Yes. Well, Schoenberg was the progenitor of what is called atonality, which meant simply that he abandoned most of the harmonies that had been in use for centuries and devised new harmonies of his own, which were sometimes quite frightening to hear and, in other cases, had a sort of a weird impressionistic beauty to them.__EOS__ But he's not going to give us a familiar sequence of notes that any 19th century composer would have done for us here.__EOS__ No. He wants to jump off into a totally different sphere. And, you know, frankly, in 1908, 1909, when he came up with this music, he was in a rather disturbed state of mind. He had discovered that, for example, his wife was having an affair. Schoenberg himself contemplated suicide, but he soldiered on and, coincidentally or not, plunged into this absolutely new musical sphere in the same period.__EOS__ You write about a dispute between Arnold Schoenberg and Kurt Weill, whom most people, I guess, would know as the man who wrote the music for ""The Threepenny Opera"" with Bertolt Brecht. And in October 1927, you write Weill wrote an article drawing a pointed contrast between those composers. And I quote, ""who, filled with disdain for the public, worked toward the solution of aesthetic problems as if behind closed doors and, on the other hand, those who open up a connection with any kind of public.""",2
53156," Why? __EOS__ Because I didn't think they were funny, and they were kind of cute. And so I would tamper with those all the time to make sure that they were - that they were funny, that they were humorous, not funny, and that they were more subtle and more believable. __EOS__ And that's when the detective, he takes two pages - he talks for two pages, and he explains everything that happened. And as the actor, you can hear the people snoring. You know the audience is tuned out. They're not interested. __EOS__ I like the way you described Columbo as looking like less than he actually is. That's something that's easy to identify with. Did you identify with that? ",3

53158," But then, let's talk again about how this came up. It came to be a problem, and again it's because of who's behind the ad.__EOS__ As the ad industry is praising it, environmental groups are crying foul. Arguing that, look who this ad is done on behalf of. The sponsoring organization is a Stanford Connecticut-based nonprofit called Keep America Beautiful - and it's a wonderful name, keep America beautiful, but this isn't your grassroots Sierra Club. The people who are behind Keep America Beautiful are the packaged goods manufacturers in this country. So we're talking McDonald's, Pepsi-Cola, Coca-Cola, Reynolds Aluminum, Nestle Waters, the American Chemistry Council. These are the people who produce both the chemicals and the packaging material that ends up in our waste stream and in our garbage stream. And so when you combine that with the Ad Council's model, which is to put focus on the individual actions people can do - it's telling us as Americans yes, pick up your litter - they have a new one on currently with Keep America Beautiful on recycling. We can recycle...__EOS__ Stop looking at us. You're in charge of this, right?__EOS__ But what about the role of corporations in solving the pollution problem we have in this country?",0

We don't know the many things we can do. I didn't know, but now I know. I think, I don't know. You know, it's kind of a chaos but an organized chaos, so I don't sleep that much. But things, you know, get done. I think it's important in order to surround yourself with good people that can help you achieve what you want to do. ",2
53160,"  Hero of the Chinese people. __EOS__ Buscemi came to the project close to the start of shooting in October 2007. Director Florian Gallenberger had already been working on the film for nearly three years, trying to negotiate his way through various Chinese ministries to get permits to shoot his film in China. __EOS__ Suddenly we were told  Okay, now you can go on with your project because they really offended us with this schoolbook. So we realized that we are not just making a film on a historical thing, but this historical subject is so alive and is so still giving trouble to them that we realized that the film will have a big significance to both Japanese and Chinese, of course. __EOS__ When Gallenberger's film opened in China, it was the biggest release ever for a German film outside Germany. But the film has not been seen in Japan, where the facts of the Nanjing Massacre, including the number of victims, are still hotly debated. ",1
53161," Thank you, Michel.__EOS__ Thank you for having us.__EOS__ Alfredo Corchado, I'm going to start with you. I think a lot of Americans might be surprised that Mexico's president-elect would leave the country right before his own inauguration. Why was this trip scheduled for this time?__EOS__ Well, it's a very important neighbor, as we all know. It's been planned for a while. Obviously, the Mexicans were waiting for the outcome of the U.S. election and they also feel it's important to begin the relationship of building trust, building the friendship with the United States. So, if anything, this was more to kind of set the tone between the two men.",3

No. It would be 10 months or so to get a consultation. If he wants to do anything it'll be six more months before an operating room comes up. __EOS__ Can you get supplemental insurance and, through that, jump ahead of the line? __EOS__ Ha. That's up in the air at the moment. The Canadians are so egalitarian - the Swedes did this too, that they first said no, no. We have a very good health care system here and that's where you're going to get your health care. Obviously some people in Canada could go south to America and buy health care without waiting in the line. The number of people who do that seems to be pretty small. It's not as big as you hear in the argument in America, but some do that. __EOS__ Let's look briefly at the fourth model that you write - the fourth and final model that you write about in your book ""The Healing of America,"" and this is the out-of-pocket model which you can sum up pretty quickly.

You recruit a guy like this and he winds up biting you? __EOS__ Absolutely, in a big way. It's a big bite, because were not talking about a single case that may have been compromised by improper leaks. We're talking about a trail of corruption, a way of life in Boston regarding the FBI and ""Whitey"" Bulger that went on for nearly two decades. ",0
53164," Paula, I want to thank you for that call. I have to take a very slight break, but I want to thank you for that call and for the honesty. It sounds like it was all around a difficult process, but it had an outcome that gives you some relief. Thanks very much for your call. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION on NPR.__EOS__ Correct. That happens often because if I've had breast cancer and I test, my - it won't affect my insurance. So - and it'll give peace of mind to my children. Whereas if a young person tests, it could be on their record that they, in fact, have the mutation.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ ...that can make them complicated.",0

What could I love more than my freedom? __EOS__  It's these people like you and never complete without a ring on your finger, dog at your feet, a house on a suburb street named after a tree. Not me. __EOS__ And you don't find that until the end that he's only thinking this because it didn't happen for him in the past.

53166," You talk pretty candidly in this book you've written with Dan Shaughnessy about what it's like to manage a collection of I'll just call them spirited and singular athletes - Pedro Martinez, Manny Ramirez, Johnny Damon, when he had hair like Fabio, Josh Beckett and others. You have some philosophy about how you do that?__EOS__ Well, I think the main thing is, it starts on the first day of spring training, is we try as a team - and when I mean we try desperately to find an identity. You know, the '04 team was very loose and, like the names you just said, free-spirited - Johnny Damon and guys like that, Kevin Millar. But when they got on the field, they cared about each other. And when the game started, they played the game the right way. So, I thought it would have been wrong to instill my will on that group. Now, the '07 group that won was a lot quieter group. It was Mike Lowell. That group of guys was a different group. And to try to clone the '04 team would have been wrong. I don't care about the decibel level in the clubhouse. What I care about are guys playing the game the right way and caring about each other on the field. And both of those teams did it. They just did it in a very different way.__EOS__ You grew up in baseball. Your father played for half a dozen Major League clubs, including the one you now manage there in Cleveland. And I'm very touched in the book the way you talk about the folks who work in the clubhouse; in many ways, people with whom you grew up, the clubbies, as you call them. What do you learn from them?__EOS__ It's hard to be a clubhouse guy without being a great guy. I mean, the nature of the job is, you know, you're picking up dirty clothes and you're doing all the tasks that the players - that nobody else wants to do. A lot of times, when we're acquiring a player, if I know the clubhouse guy on that team, I'll call him. Because they know what kind of guy the guy really is. Everywhere I've been, I've always gotten real close to them and I don't think that'll change here in Cleveland. It's just the nature of the job. You know, you spend your whole life at the ballpark. You get really close to those guys.",0
53167," I'm curious, too, about the title, and I'm sure you've been getting a lot of questions about this. ""Lyle Lovett and His Large Band  It's Not Big It's Large."" It's a funny sort of subtext. But is there an important distinction there that you're making between a large band versus a sort of classic big band sound? __EOS__ Well, you know, all along, some of my arrangements reflect jazz influences. But my arrangements were never straight up, legit big band. And so that's why, initially, I called the band the large band. We were a lot of people, but it wasn't big band music, really. And so this is just a continuation of the joke, really. Because big as - people do refer to it as the big band. And we don't do big band music. __EOS__ Mm-hmm. Well, we opened this segment with the song ""Tickle Toe,"" which is a jazz number by Lester Young that your large band does. But the CD moves into very different kinds of material. There's a country western thing happening as usual, as well as blues and spirituals.

So there just needs to be balance. What I think radical gay marriage groups will want to do is simply have what I'm going to say - an imbalanced celebration of homosexuality as a lifestyle and a historical, let's say, recasting of history.__EOS__ But if you argue that marriage is what's fundamental, could you argue the opposite, that actually having people who wish to be married lifts up marriage as the value, as opposed to destroying it?__EOS__ I would say this to you to your logic. There are boundaries and balance in things and I think, theoretically, what you say could be right. What - and, practically, we just need people engaged in the discussion. What happens is pendulums swing, imbalances happen everywhere. The challenge we have with the Christian traditional marriage movement is very often - folks back away and then they get all energized and want to reinsert themselves and they have this tension.

I think it's a great resource, but I think that sometimes they just have a tendency to say any film that you're even remotely discussed doing, they put that down as pending, but I - the only film I'm going to do is Woody's new film this fall.__EOS__ OK.",1
53190," Oh no - I guess I'm not. I really don't want to make up your mind. You know, I think the word amalgamation, which is employed most of the time in descriptions of people as a derisive term, in fact, can inform a more inclusive worldview of what a mixed race identity is. I think what you'd find among the people of Russell's Knob is that they have managed to bring whatever strengths and survival skills from all of their ancestors and bring them together to make a strong whole. To me, that's what amalgamation is and I think it's a positive.__EOS__ Breena Clarke's new novel is called ""Angels Make Their Hope Here.""

53191," Hi. Can you hear me? __EOS__ Yeah. Go ahead, please. __EOS__ Hi. I was calling with a question that I'm almost terrified to ask, and it's about your politics. Not that I need you to go into detail about your respective politics, but I'm really curious as to how similar they are, and terrified because I'm afraid you're going to tell us that our political affiliation is very genetic. __EOS__ Well, you - it's Paula - and you happen to be right in that they are highly genetic and that not just anecdotal experience that Elyse and I do fall very closely on political and religious beliefs, but in research, the data has actually shown that that is the case as well, that they are largely hereditary, which is not to say you're born a Democrat or Republican, but you are born with a proclivity towards certain traits that will veer you in a given direction. You know, either you're more close minded versus more open minded -no, more free thinking, more traditional, those sorts of traits - more empathetic, more, you know, all of those characteristics lead one in a certain direction politically and religiously.

Tell us about the kidnapping.__EOS__ In 2008, Clark abducted his daughter on the street in Boston after a custody hearing. He disappeared with her and a nationwide Amber Alert was issued.__EOS__ This is 10 years after your first met him.__EOS__ Ten years after I first met him. In the year before the kidnapping, I'd been talking to him on the phone a lot. We were both divorced. We both didn't see our kids as much as we wanted to. He wasn't seeing his daughter almost at all. And I'd really let him cry on my shoulder for about a year about his grief over his child. So I turn on the radio or TV or Internet, I can't remember which in 2008, and see that there's a nationwide manhunt on for Clark Rockefeller. He's taken his daughter and I thought, oh my Lord, he's snapped. You know, his heart broke, he snapped and he took her. Well, by the time he was caught, the Rockefeller family was saying he's not a Rockefeller, we don't know who he is. And I thought they were lying. I thought they were disavowing somebody who'd sort of besmirched their name, you know, maybe a bastard child of the family or something.",0
53193," I know, for me, when I had my first baby, just something goes off in you where you - you know, I'm a way bigger worrier than I ever was before I had kids and...__EOS__ Sure.__EOS__ ...you know, the stress and anxiety that can go along with motherhood, I have had to battle that. So on one hand, I understand this mother wanting to build walls around her children. But I try to sing it more from the perspective of  You can't do that.__EOS__  Mother, did it need to be so high?",2
53194," 99.99 percent of us don't understand the lyrics. __EOS__ Guitarist and collaborator Michael Brook says that would bother Nusrat a little. __EOS__ But I think he also felt that whatever spiritual component there was, that was in the lyrics, but it was also in the way he sang it. __EOS__ And so that's what he focused on. ",2
53195," I guess I wondered if ""The War"" was in some ways between you and your father.__EOS__ No. I mean, I gave up that war a long time ago.__EOS__ Loud as this album is, there is a sense of peaceful resolution.

Now, I read, and tell me if this is true, that the director of the film, Darren Aronofsky, actually created a backstage competition between the two of you, that he would tell you that she was doing better than you were in terms of really getting the ballet moves down. And then he'd tell her that you were doing better than she was. __EOS__ Exactly. __EOS__ So did he actually do that? ",1
53197," Well, here we are, Afro Blue. John Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, Elvin Jones. Birdland, 1963. By a  Afro Blue a great deal from when I first heard it probably in 1963 because of the way in which the blues and Latin music were brought together so well, and also African music. That is, in the rhythms that Elvin Jones was playing on the drums. And I found that extraordinarily exciting. __EOS__ Talk to me about where you developed the love of music and, in particular, jazz. __EOS__ Well, in Considering Genius, I talk about my early life in Los Angeles and the fact that my mother had recordings of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller in the house. And I was first attracted to the recordings that she has or had. __EOS__ Yeah, I'm going to get into that in just a minute, Stanley. Because that's very interesting how you paint the portrait, a far truer portrait  of many of these people. And it makes them more complex and more interesting in my mind than most of what we often read. ",0
53198," Before it was Fulton, it was called Rocketts, which was the name of the landing on the James River. And that is where the enslaved Africans were taken off the ship and marched the couple miles into Shockoe Bottom to the slave market.__EOS__ Can you give me an idea of how the land was confiscated?__EOS__ From what I know, it started with people in the newspaper saying things like, well, we have to do something about this community, calling it blighted, that sort of thing. And then afterwards, developers came in with the help of the city and then took it over. The same thing happened in Vinegar Hill, which is a neighborhood in Charlottesville, which, if you've ever been, they have a downtown mall. And the Omni Hotel sits on Vinegar Hill now but it was...__EOS__ I've been to that hotel. Mm-hmm.",2
53199," I was just, like, always playing in the dirt and, like, doing my own thing and, you know, just kind of weird kid. And Jess was a weirdo too, right?__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ And so we kind of bonded over that. And, well, now we're grown up, I guess, so I guess we're wildewomen.__EOS__ Yeah.",2
53200," Sure. This is actually the beginning of the chapter that chronicles the end of my brother's life, and his death.__EOS__ That's Jesmyn Ward, reading from her new memoir, ""Men We Reaped."" Let's talk a little bit about one of the men you write about, Demond. You say most of the young men you knew dealt drugs, at some point, to make ends meet; and Demond is an example. He'd been the witness to the aftermath of a drug-related killing and had agreed to testify against the shooter, and then he was found shot to death. What was your reaction when you heard that?__EOS__ You know, I was shocked. I think we were all shocked. We didn't - you know, I don't think that it's something that anyone expected to happen because that kind of drug-related violence, I don't feel like that we see that often, where I'm from. It just doesn't happen. And so when it actually happened, it was a huge surprise because everyone grows up together, like in my, you know, in my small hometown; and everyone knows everyone else. And there's such large, extended families that a lot of people are related to each other.__EOS__ Let's talk about your brother. Your brother Joshua died just before his 20th birthday. You'd just graduated college. He was your younger brother. Would you describe what happened?",0
53201," And this conclusion about military occupation, that's not new. Your evidence is new. __EOS__ That's exactly right. I've put forward the hypothesis before that military occupation is the root cause of suicide terrorism, but never have we had such definitive data behind this hypothesis. __EOS__ And how do you make that determination? __EOS__ Well, what we do is we actually look a lot like researchers studying smoking and lung cancer, who gets the cancer of suicide terrorism, and who does not. ",0
53202," Oh, my God. Oh, yes, Melissa. Absolutely. I mean, you know, it's embarrassing if there's other musicians there. But it just happens people are very understanding. __EOS__  I'd keep you with me still even though I know nothing's worth the holding if you can't let go. I spend my nights alone or in drunken company, that's the only medicine left for me. Till I fly, till I fly, fly away. Till I fly, till I fly, fly away. __EOS__ Despite all the troubles you've had with your voice, have you thought about whether you could do some touring dates for the new album? __EOS__ Well, you know, I have thought about it and then sort of dismiss it with the next thought. I mean, I would love to. It's not - I think people think it's reluctance on my part to go on the road. It's really not. I'd love to go on the road, but I'm frightened of shortchanging people. Because if I seize up, you know, it's like your arm seizing up with arthritis. I mean, there's nothing I can do. I just sort of go on and croak. And I mean, I've done that before. And the audience is always really good about it. It's, you know, sort of very disconcerting for me. And I just don't know at this age whether, you know, whether I can put myself through that. So, probably not. ",2
53203," Well, an inability to do anything else, among other things.__EOS__ .__EOS__ I first started reading it seriously when I was in the Army in Verona, Italy. And I was 23 years old, which is very late for a poet. Most poets starts about the age of 3, as I've come to find out.__EOS__ .",0
53204," Would have occurred to me.__EOS__ You know, being - what was I? - 16, 17 at the time, you experiment at that age. And I kind of - then the riff came to me  da da da da da. And I played it to sort of a country riff, to begin with. Then I thought it would be good to just have power, of course. I also then went to the piano to write the rest of the song. And the piano changed the dynamic a little bit.__EOS__ But there's something so raw about the track. A lot of people see it as the kind of predecessor of punk. What did you hear...__EOS__ Well, that...",2
53205," How hard is that? I mean, you've used music by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. It probably doesn't get much harder than that.__EOS__ It can be difficult. I mean, you know, you have to - for those people who don't understand the process, each piece of music is - there isn't like a bluebook where you can just go in and order these things up. You have to deal with the creators or the publishers on each song. And each song, there's both the song, the composition and the recording that have to be negotiated for. So it can be complicated.__EOS__ Give me a sense of what you said to the Rolling Stones' people the first time when it was a very small budget and you wanted one of their songs. Because you've used their songs in most of the Wes Anderson films.__EOS__ Right. Well, we put our records out actually now on Abco Records. The last three records have come out on Abco which is, you know, which holds a good portion of the Rolling Stones' catalog. And so, I've sometimes said that the Rolling Stones have sort of become our house band a little bit.",2
53206," Well, we don't deny that we kind of asked for that, a male and a female singing songs about love and the lack thereof. You know, it's a common place that your mind will go. But we're both married to other people. And Joy and I have talked before about, yes, there's chemistry but there's more than just romantic chemistry and... __EOS__ Yeah. There's musical chemistry. I don't think that a relationship - if John Paul and I were together in that way, I don't think a relationship could be very sustainable. __EOS__ No. __EOS__ Singing I don't love you but I always will over and over and over every night, I think someone would wind up on the couch. ",2
53207," It's a guy named W. Kamau Bell. The show is called ""Totally Biased."" I would say it's kind of a cross between Bill Maher and Jon Stewart, but black and with a lot more jokes. And those guys have jokes, but it's a lot of funny stuff. And, you know, he's kind of political. He's from the Bay area and, you know, it's going to be pretty funny. I mean, if you've liked other things I've produced - you know, ""Everybody Hates Chris,"" or, you know, whatever - then I think you're going to like this.__EOS__ And why do you like producing? You know...__EOS__ It's not the - I mean, I think producing is like a calling. It's not, like, something - I'm not, like, Jerry Bruckheimer or something...__EOS__ ...you know, something, you know, like, I'm here to produce. I mean, just occasionally, you know, you see somebody, and you just want to help them. And I saw this guy, and I thought with a little help, he could have a television show. And, you know, and people did that for me. So why not, you know, if I don't help this smart black guy, who's going to help him? So there you go.",1
53208," Now was he doing that because he genuinely hadn't read the script or was he doing that to show you the obnoxious character he could be? __EOS__ I think that it was a mixture of both. He definitely hadn't read the script. He is in life, perhaps, the nicest guy I've ever met. But he just nailed this kind of - because, you know, I must say I stole my character in ""I Love You, Man,"" the Sidney Fife character, directly from Russell. Russell has, like I said, that quality of just not caring what other people think or at least seeming like he doesn't. And I thought what an amazing quality to have in your girlfriend's new boyfriend, someone who like - it's not that he's jerk, he just doesn't even feel weird or bad that he's dating your girlfriend. You know, it just like not on his radar that that should be an awkward situation because it was very important to me for all the characters in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" that they not be stereotypes. I didn't want it to be a diatribe against a cheating ex-girlfriend for example. It would have been really easy to make her just a real villainous character. __EOS__ If you're just joining us, my guest is Jason Segel and he's now starring with Paul Rudd in the new movie ""I Love You, Man."" He is also on TV in the series ""How I Met Your Mother."" I want to play a scene from the first series that you were on... __EOS__ Oh, sure. ",1
53209," Mm, let's get another caller on the line. Stefanie, Stefanie's with us from Berkeley in California. __EOS__ Oh, yes, hello, and thank you again for taking my call. I have a question for Miss Vincent about what, if anything, she has learned, or if there any lessons or concepts that you have learned or come across in your 18 months as a man, that you would be able to apply to your future life as a woman? __EOS__ Okay, well, I would say the biggest maybe advantage that I gained, if that's part of what of you mean is I experienced in the workplace especially, male privilege, I guess I would say, and a certain entitlement, a bearing more than anything else. I don't mean privilege so much in getting more financially or politically, but really just that people expect you to be more confident. They accept a kind of arrogance from you and a bluster, and I sort of responded to that to the point where, you know, I think women spend a lot of time, we spend a lot of time apologizing for everything we do. So you know when you ask for water in a restaurant, for example, I often will say, oh, I'm sorry to bother you, could we get some water when you have a chance? Whereas as a guy, I would just say, I'd like some water, or, get me some water. And it was just, it wasn't interpreted as rude. And so... __EOS__ Mm hmm, they use fewer words. ",0

53211," Well, with Jack Kennedy there was always this sort of, I would say, wary respect. The crucial thing with Lyndon Johnson and the Kennedys was his relation with Robert Kennedy. And there was a real hatred there. You know, as a writer, Dave, you hate to use certain words because they sound too loaded, and one of them is hate. But hate isn't too strong a word to describe the relationship between Lyndon Johnson and Robert Kennedy.__EOS__ Yeah, in the book you - there are some great descriptions of some of his early encounters with Robert Kennedy, when Kennedy was a Senate staffer. And yeah, this relationship was poisoned from the beginning. Lyndon Johnson, you know, thought seriously about whether he should accept the vice presidential nomination. Back then the vice presidency I think lacked some of the visibility it does today. It was considered a dead end.__EOS__ Yes.__EOS__ He took it and had ambitions of making it something because he was a guy who knew, understood power and thought he could do more with it. What was he able to do? What was his status? How was he treated by the Kennedy crew as vice president?",0
53212," Sure, Amy. Sure.__EOS__ As the clip you played showed, it's not a woman - a man against woman crime. It's a crime against both men and women, so it actually doesn't have to do with women being in the military or not. People are being raped.__EOS__ But there are those who certainly feel that way. I mean, you just know that there are certain people who believe that this is - that part of the issue here is that the presence of women is just somehow so provocative that that's why. Yeah.__EOS__ But that's - you can just point out, that's a fallacy because statistically men are raped at a slightly larger rate than women in the military, so it's not a crime against women particularly.",3
53213," ...when you call somebody a young lady who really like isn't young, it's actually really condescending because you are implying that they are, like, so old that you have to call them young and that you even think that that's flattering because they're ashamed of their age.

I'm thrilled. I love you so much for saying that.__EOS__ And then, I was so embarrassed. And then, I put my hand on his arm and I started saying I'm so sorry. I apologize.

53216,"  Very simple reason   I just love the characters.  I      grew--you know, I think many writers grew up reading and I grew up      reading just as much as anyone else did, but I was reading comic books.      That's what I loved reading.  I loved Superman; I loved Batman.  And I      think writing comic books is a little bit like when you were      little--there was that kid down the block who always had the best toys in      the whole block.  And you always wanted to go to his house and play.      Well, I think Superman and Batman and Wonder Woman are just the best toys      on the block, and I love my characters.  When I write my thrillers, I      love writing those characters, but there's something about playing with      Superman and Batman and Wonder Woman--putting words in their mouths. __EOS__  We had the Habivs who lived a few blocks over, our family and      friends.

53221," Yes.__EOS__ You write you had always told your students if there is an intruder in your home in the middle of the night, you just pretend you're sleeping because the vast majority of burglars who are home invaders, they want to get the goods and go. They don't really want to hurt you. But what you actually did, instead of taking your advice, was?__EOS__ In one split second I leapt out of the bed and grabbed him by the throat with my hand. I have no idea why I did that. I mean looking back; it's an instinctive reaction from the amygdala, the fight/flight system. I have no idea what I was doing. All I knew at that point is that, I mean he was hitting me with everything he had. It felt like he had four fists because he was kicking me with his feet and hitting me with his hands. What I didn't know is that during the fight - because it was dark - he had a knife in his hand and when he hit me hard in the throat, hit me hard in the head, I saw white light, he threw me against the door. What fortunately for me occurred is that the blade of the knife snapped off early on in the fight, so when he stuck the knife into my throat, there was only two or three millimeters of metal left on the handle so I lost my voice and I only needed five or six stitches in my throat.__EOS__ So he slit your throat but not much of it.",3
53222," Fun for me, too. I have to admit, I think part of me thought I'd stayed at the half-hour-comedy dance a bit too long, and I think part of me was going, wow, I'm not as funny as these other people who are coming up, and I was kind of boring myself in a way. Then ""Damages"" came along and really kind of turned things around for me.__EOS__ Well, you mentioned ""Damages,"" so this is a perfect opportunity to play a scene from it, and ""Damages"" is an FX series starring Glenn Close as a lawyer, and in this you play Arthur Frobisher, a billionaire CEO who cashed in his stocks, and then the company went under, leaving the employees without jobs or pensions.__EOS__ And slightly drunk.__EOS__ Slightly drunk, with a whole box of, like, your trophies and your ribbons and memorabilia that's designed to show him what each of these things represent in your life and what you had to go through to achieve the success that each of these objects represent.

53224," Yeah, I actually - almost the first story I ever wrote for the Wall Street Journal, where I covered broadcasting, was about Don Wildman, who founded the American Family Association. And so I was writing about it in, I think, 1981.__EOS__ Didn't he also push back against the National Endowment for the Arts when it funded gay-themed art, sexually explicit art, and transgressive art?__EOS__ Oh, definitely. It developed from, you know, just originally going after the networks to kind of a larger crusade against kind of modern transgressive, as you say, culture. They really wanted to sort of police the culture and keep it old-fashioned and in line with kind of biblical values and were - particularly on the subject of - anything sexual or any religious, they were on it.__EOS__ So Don Wildman, the founder of the American Family Association, is now the chairman emeritus. His son Tim is the president. Has the emphasis of the American Family Association changed?",3
53225," Well, you know, they're wonderful for certain purposes. You know, the fact that they're so bright means you can see them, you know, across the vast distances of the universe and then that means you're getting to look way back in time, which is what we want to do because we want to see how much the universe has been slowing down. That's all great. But the problem is that they're, you know, in all other respects they're a real pain in the neck. They only explode a few times per millennium in any given galaxy and, you know, how long do you want to wait around to do your research project? They don't give you any advance warning at all when they're going to explode so, you know, what we need to do is we need to use the largest telescopes in the world. You have to apply for them months and months in advance and you might get one or two nights. And, you know, it makes a terrible proposal to say, you know, I would like to use the, you know, Tech Telescope on the night of March the 3rd because some time in the next, you know, few hundred years a supernova might explode.__EOS__ And, you know, of course, they...__EOS__ Out of all things.__EOS__ You know, and they don't last long. They disappear in a couple of weeks and you have to catch them on their way up. So that's the sense in which you, you know, when we started the project it seemed a little bit quixotic. So what we had to do is we had to figure out ways to turn what would otherwise be a, you know, a very, you know, awkward project into something that you could make very practical and reliable. And what it meant was essentially you had to come up with technologies, we developed some new cameras that would allow you to observe many, many galaxies all at one time on a very large telescope so that now you had a reasonably good shot that on a, you know, a couple of nights of observation there would be at least a few supernovas that would be exploding. And then we had to figure out some ways to time things so that, you know, we would guarantee that when we caught them we'd only catch the ones that were on their way up by comparing it to images that we'd just taken a few weeks earlier so it didn't give the supernova enough time to reach their peak and then start to fade.",3
53226," Oh, guarantee is a strong word. __EOS__ It is a strong word. __EOS__ We're doing our very, very best. __EOS__ I have this image in my head of just scissors flying and clippers clipping wildly where you are right now, trying to get everything done in time. ",3

There are more that resemble small barns that can accept the day's light only through open doors. None is open. There is no cook smoke in the air. I'm thinking everyone has gone off. Then I see a tiny steeple on the hill beyond the village, and I'm certain the people are at evening prayer. I decide to knock on the door of the largest house, the one that will have a servant inside.  __EOS__ It's too bad that you can't read to me every night. ",0

The composer told Hampton he wanted an Englishman to write ""Appomattox"" because Americans carried too much baggage from the Civil War. ",2
53230, Yeah. I'm against it. I think invariably they're bad.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ Invariably they ruin a movie.__EOS__ Yeah.,1
53231, Yeah? __EOS__ ...the undertaker... __EOS__ Lord. __EOS__ ...he's getting ready... ,2
53232," In other words, people think, oh, Irish people are always talking. But there's no structure on that, and often what they talk about is not what they're thinking about. So yes, I don't come out of an oral tradition. I come out of silence.__EOS__ You come out of silence? What does that mean?__EOS__ I mean that what I noticed most in my childhood, or even in my adulthood, were the silences between the words, the things that were not said. The reason why the story was told, so some other story that was more true might not be told. And it's my job to tell that story.__EOS__ Colm Toibin, thank you so much for talking with us.",3
53233," And they were, of course, Roman copies of Greek statues that were originally, well, of different kind of marble entirely and painted. __EOS__ And painted, yes. __EOS__ So that they got them completely wrong. __EOS__ Well, the idea of beauty being white, that is another enlightenment idea, actually, an 18th-century idea by another German, named Winckelmann, who's the father of art history and who embedded a kind of gay aesthetic in art history. ",0
53234," Well, I think you should go out with the title track, ""The Man."" That's the one that is just kicking off right now.__EOS__  Oh, I like it.__EOS__ A perfect way to go out.__EOS__ Yeah.",2
53235," Well, you know, I just got this energy of just, you know, I wanted to make a monkey puppet. And so I saw the lining of my father's coat, and I took it out, and I cut it up, and I made a monkey out of it and realized what I had done afterwards. And I actually hid - after I built the puppet.__EOS__ Next time, ask. And so, you know, yeah.__EOS__ In what ways were they creative?__EOS__ Well, my mom, she sewed a lot, and she taught me how to sew on the Singer sewing machine. And she sewed clothes, her dresses, and also what she would do is she would take some of the material that was leftover, and she would cover some of her shoes with that same material. So she was very creative in her own way. My father drew a lot. We had pastel colors and paints and stuff that he would - he loved drawing and stuff, so...",1
53236," You know, when we talk about love stories and the thing that draws us in, sucks us in almost to a vortex, it seems like it's not the love itself; it's the - I don't know, almost like viewing the world from a position of absolute vulnerability __EOS__ It's vulnerability and the kind of heightened awareness, I think, that people feel when they're in love. When I think about a lot of my favorite novels — ""Portrait of a Lady"" by Henry James or ""Lolita"" by Nabokov, I mean, they are all love stories, Anna Karenina obviously is another one. And in the case of ""Lolita,"" it can be the kind of a perverse love story but still the force of the desire drives the prose and drives the plot. __EOS__ Do you consider yourself to be a romantic? __EOS__ I consider myself too old to be a romantic anymore. I was terribly romantic as a youth, and I think I retain a portion of that romanticism. ",0
53237," I don't know. I mean, I think it's all intertwined within the same just transformation of communications and culture and social media, but it's been interesting. I mean, you can look at small cases, like, you know, and ASAP Rocky's from Harlem and takes on a Texas sound. They're like, you know, a whole new wave and tempo of almost beat or sound becomes stylistically, you know, trendy. And regardless of what region you're from at this point, any rapper can kind of embody that sound within their newest project.__EOS__ You know, I've got to say, the album is a bargain. There's a lot of music on it. I mean, you guys packed that thing full of music. I wonder if there's anything that you think is absolutely taboo, that you won't be able to talk about in rap.__EOS__ No. I have tackled everything from gay marriage to white privilege to, you know, satire to different characters. I mean, if you look at my body of work, there is absolutely nothing that I've been - to me, what's exciting about being an artist is being able to tackle issues that you're afraid to speak on, and that's what pushes me creatively, is to be who I am, no filter, and put it all out there.__EOS__ OK. So you tell us. What song should we end with?",2
53238," I'm speaking with actor and author Andrew McCarthy. He has a new memoir out called ""The Longest Way Home  One Man's Quest for the Courage to Settle Down."" This book is, in many ways, about traveling - your literal travels over a period of time - but in more ways, it's about this kind of metaphorical journey that you had to take before you got married.__EOS__ Well, I guess I'll see you at the altar. What propelled you out that door?__EOS__ Yeah. That's an interesting question, isn't it? Look, I find answers to my questions when I travel. Some people go to therapy. Some people sit around and have coffee with their buddies. I find answers by traveling. You know, I'm illuminated to myself when I go.__EOS__ Enough of it. You know, I was so excited to be finally getting married. We finally decided after four years, yes, let's get married, and then the next day, I was leaving on a trip for a magazine down to Patagonia. So I was sad to be going, but at the same instant, I was so excited to be leaving.",0
53239,"  Boyd, I've been to Mexico. I don't think you'd like it.__EOS__  How so?__EOS__  There's a lot of Mexicans.__EOS__ That's Timothy Olyphant and Walton Goggins as Raylan Givens and Boyd Crowder in next weeks heard season premiere of the FX series ""Justified.""",3
53240," The funny thing to me is that his father has a laugh that is, like, 10 times funnier than his. Which I'm going to try to impersonate for you right now.__EOS__ I was - it's going to be incredibly loud.__EOS__ Yeah. That's exactly what my dad's laugh sounds like. We both have ridiculous laughs. But, yeah. People ask me. And it's just - people actually don't ask me, like, why you play the same character all the time. That's ...__EOS__ They know why.",1
53241," At the outdoor market at the foot of the Rialto, the woman known only as a longtime American resident is warmly greeted in the local dialect.__EOS__ This is real Venice. Venetian is music to me. I always feel very strongly at home when I come back after a trip and hear veneziano on the boats.__EOS__ When we part, and she walks back home, it's clear Donna Leon has the seaman's gait that Brunetti and all Venetians have - a gait acquired with the knowledge of centuries that the ground may be sinking below their feet. Sylvia Poggioli, NPR News.__EOS__ And we're keeping this series afloat all summer long. On Monday we'll visit Providence, Rhode Island, where the crime writing of author Bruce DeSilva draws on his former life as a reporter.",0
53242," Can we hear a little bit of ""Children Album Gangsta""?__EOS__ Indeed.  A children's show is harder than the ""Showtime at the Apollo,"" and they don't need a sandman to take you away pronto. Now, kids stay excited, but if kids don't like it, they ain't gonna boo you, but they will start crying. Children let you know that it ain't about the gold. It's about having good times and having a good soul. To keep it honest with you, they the realest of folks. It's crazy how much we could learn from them, even as adults.__EOS__ That's Christylez Bacon, performing in our studios, in his hometown of Washington, D.C. His new album is called ""Hip Hop Unplugged.""__EOS__  Society puts us inside these boxes, while sealing us airtight. But I'm Christylez Bacon. I'm a rip, what, in the patter, I could freestyle in the hood and then...",2
53243," The female dog word. What's up with that? __EOS__ Yeah. __EOS__ What's up with that? A lot of people view them as equivalent - at least in terms of disrespect. So tell me about that. __EOS__ Well, it's just crazy because, you know, a lot of - in a lot of interviews I get people have called me a feminist rapper. Like people have called me a feminist rapper and I would say, you know, I'm making music more geared towards women. But at the same time, you know, you get a lot of guys that will call you the B-word and stuff like that, but when you're within a group of your girlfriends it's different. Like all your girlfriends call each other that to get your attention or, you know, like in a joking way so, you know, it's all just in a joking way to connect with female fans because I mean if you called a guy that he would probably be pretty mad at you, you know what I'm saying? But if you call a girl that and you know this girl, like it's not in a disrespectful way. ",2
53244," Well, I should say you don't look a thing like Tootsie, by the way. We're going to take another call now. We got a call to Ed from York, Pennsylvania. Hi, Ed. __EOS__ Hi. How are you? __EOS__ Good. Go ahead. __EOS__ Yeah. I would just - makes you go back when you listen to all of these veterans, telling their stories, you know, about the combat and the sacrifices that they gave to this great nation of ours, you know. And it just - you know, on another somber, on another note, you know, it's also a somber occasion to remember all the people that didn't come home, you know. And I just want to say to everybody out there, you got to remember the veterans. You got to take care of the veterans. You know, there is veterans out here on the street corners in my hometown. They can't get jobs. They're not getting health care. They're not being taken care of, but they made the ultimate sacrifice to this country. Just like in prior - in wars prior, you know, it's always the common man, you know, the miner, the farmer, you know, the blue-collar worker, that drops his job, leaves his family behind to go serve at a cost and protect this great nation of ours.
