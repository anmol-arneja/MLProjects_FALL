0," Carlotta Gall will be back in the second half of the show. Her new book is called ""The Wrong Enemy  America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014."" She's now the North Africa correspondent for the New York Times. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.__EOS__ This is FRESH AIR, I'm Terry Gross, back with Carlotta Gall. She covered Afghanistan for the New York Times for over a decade, starting in November 2001. Her new book is called ""The Wrong Enemy  America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014."" Gall is now the New York Times North Africa correspondent.__EOS__ We were - it was during the surge, which was I think an incredibly important operation. You know, President Obama ordered the surge of troops to go in and clear the Taliban who'd become, who'd almost taken over the whole of the South. And so we both thought it was a really important trip but we also knew it was dangerous, so you had to go on patrol and follow exactly behind the soldiers in front of you. And what Joao did, he's a very experienced war reporter and war photographer. And he, three soldiers stepped over this mine in front and he followed them. He was the one who stepped on it, so incredibly. But, you know, we were taking those risks and we felt it was important to be there and report on what was happening in southern Afghanistan at that time.__EOS__ And by being back on his feet, he's back on, he's on prosthetic legs."
1," Yes. __EOS__ And just as he was terrific in supporting roles in ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" and so many other films. But how did you and Martin Scorsese choose him as a leading man? __EOS__ You know, originally, you know, in doing the research, we looked at pictures of the real Nucky. And I had gone down to Atlantic City on, you know, weekend trips, by which I mean to drink and gamble, and just informally polled people who I would meet down there and ask them  Do you know who Nucky Johnson is? And almost nobody knew. __EOS__ Oh, that's right. "
2," Absolutely. It's a great image. I mean it's a - he loves the tattoo and I think it's a - it marks his face in a very distinguished way. And also his other tattoos, which are Mao and Che, you know. He says that he hated America for putting him in prison unjustly when he didn't do what he was convicted for. And his protest against being falsely incarcerated was to have himself tattooed with symbols of anti-American fervor. __EOS__ So, when you were interviewing Mike Tyson for your film, what interested you most in what he had to say about his approach to boxing in terms of how he prepared mentally and what went on his mind when he was in the ring just before he went into the ring? __EOS__ Well, there's a fascinating passage in the movie where he talks about being consumed by fear during training and leading up to a fight, fear of the other fighter. And that only as he's walking towards the ring the night of the fight, does he start to feel that he can summon up enough ferocity in him to purge himself of the fear and inflict it on the other fighter. And he does it through his eyes, through his gaze, staring at the eyes of the opponent, walking towards the other opponent - and the opponent. __EOS__ He never gave you that look, did he? "
3," Right. Right. __EOS__ ...they'd be getting less oxygen to their brain. __EOS__ Yeah. You don't want diseases, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, anything like that - of course diabetes is not good for the brain. Anything that causes - of course a disease in the brain is not, is certainly not good. __EOS__ Yeah.  Let's go to Susan in Oregon. Hi, Susan. "
4,"  Mason, do not throw things at your sister.__EOS__  She's faking. She hit me first.__EOS__  Listen, both of you. I'm going back to bed. I don't want to hear another peep out of here for an hour. Go to sleep.__EOS__  Faker."
5," That's true. Senegal is a very interesting country. I lived there as a student for about a half a year in 2002, 2003. I mentioned this Internet penetration rate and, in Senegal, that's about 10, 12 percent. So about 10 or 12 percent of the population of Senegal is on the Internet. __EOS__ If you're just tuning in, I'm Tony Cox and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm talking to Cyrus Farivar, author and technology journalist, about how the rest of the world gets online. __EOS__ Well, I think that what that headline is referring to and what that story tells, I think, is this larger story of, yes, how in the last 10 years especially the United States has fallen in terms of Internet prowess in terms of level of connectivity. __EOS__ One of the things that we mentioned in the intro is the role that repressive governments are playing with regard to access to the Internet in places around the world. What are you finding, particularly as it relates to the Arab world at the moment? "
6," There are a lot. They represent about 36 percent of all voters in presidential elections, and in congressional midterm elections it's even higher. There are about 100 million white guys in America. Of course not everyone votes in any political block. But it's vital because they directly correlate to Barack Obama's majority. __EOS__ We only have a few moments, but you said that the white men felt abandoned by President Obama in a way that they didn't by FDR. __EOS__ I did. And it's  that goes back to priorities. And those priorities are of course that FDR focused his first year exclusively on the economy and jobs. And Barack Obama put health care to the front of his agenda. __EOS__ What - is there anything that the Democrats and the president can do to fix this just briefly? "
7," Without giving too much of the plot away, the film ends with a revolving door.__EOS__ Is that a big, fat metaphor . May I ask the writer and director?__EOS__ Well, that's David's touch of genius there. So I can't take any claim for that.__EOS__ I have to say that was - that was, I guess, metaphorical opportunism. When we went to one of the prison locations, I was very struck by the revolving doors. They just seemed to offer a kind of visual metaphor but also that sort of the sound of them slowing down as people go through them and the idea of them sort of always being in one direction. It was actually the Maze prison in Belfast, which is a very sort of powerful, emotional place."
8," We should also say you are estranged from your parents, so they were not a source of support for you through this.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ So you are taken to the psychiatric facility against your will. How long were you there?__EOS__ I was on the psych ward for five days."
9," Oh, my gosh. Sure.__EOS__  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every summer card I write. May your spring be merry and bright and may all the rest of your summertime be hot.__EOS__  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write...__EOS__ Michael Buble, he joined us from our studios in New York. His new album is called ""To Be Loved."" It is out now."
10," When a woman finds out that she's actually carrying multiple fetuses, that several of the embryos have become fetuses, there is a procedure to eliminate some of the fetuses, and some women opt to do that. What is the procedure and what are some of the larger issues that it raises? __EOS__ Yes, the issue is called selective reduction, and there are a number of doctors who perform this procedure. Most of them don't like to really have their names published because it could be seen as a form of abortion, I think. That's arguable. I had one doctor argue that, you know, abortion completely eliminates all fetuses in the uterus and selective reduction doesn't. __EOS__ Are there choices you can make during the fertility treatments that you're having to prevent or at least seriously limit the possibility that you'll be carrying multiple fetuses? __EOS__ Well, I think one of the first choices would be how many embryos to transfer back, and this is one of the first choices that patients face. And it's again, a little bit of a tug-of-war between the patient and the doctor. Typically, it's a choice that does reside with the patient, although I think doctors increasingly are willing to say, you know what, I'm just not going to do three. You're young, and you have a good chance of conceiving, and so we're going to do two or we're going to do one. But that's, I think, the first opportunity that patients have to limit multiples. "
11," I looked like my father, especially the moustache. No, I was not an attractive child growing up. I mean, my Girl Scout uniform, I didn't use it as a uniform. I used it as a tent. I was a fat child.__EOS__ And it was difficult. You know, I watch ""Glee,"" the television show ""Glee."" That wasn't my high school. My high school, the fat girl was not popular. My high school, the homosexual was running, but not running and dancing, he was running for his life. I just find that most of us went through very rough times growing up.__EOS__ So you say your parents hated you making a scene when you were growing up. What kind of scenes did you make?__EOS__ Well, not so much scenes. My parents just didn't like me. You know, until I was nine years old, my mother was trying to get an abortion, and that sticks with you. That hurts. What she'd say to the doctor  Is there any way possible to get rid of this thing?"
12,"  The rent got to be too heavy. Now it's a smoothie place, Re-Juicination. __EOS__  Oh, no. __EOS__  Yeah, Sid sells on Ebay now. __EOS__  Oh, that makes sense. I should be doing that. "
13," Bolero is a Latin love song or kind of a ballad. And boleros...__EOS__ Oh, people know ""Bolero"" here.__EOS__ Yeah, and boleros are always very tragic, no? It's always losing your love and getting together again or losing it again. So, we try to give the movie this song structure of the bolero, no? And to use all the conventions, the sentimental, the tragic center of the bolero to the movie, no? So, that's why Chico and Rita are always losing each other, and this kind of thing.__EOS__ I don't want to give away the ending, but let's just say it would be nice to see this film around Valentine's Day."
14," Nice, he sounds awfully excited.__EOS__ Yeah.__EOS__ You also met with - without question - my favorite of the Golden Girls.__EOS__ Yeah, Betty White. And I was in her dressing room. And she wasn't there yet, so I was getting my microphone out and my recorder. And then all of a sudden, I hear the sound of these little heels clicking down the hallway. And I look up and there she is, you know, Betty White. And you never really know how these initial interactions are going to go. But she offered me some Twizzlers and a Diet Coke, and she was just so welcoming and really nice, so it was great."
15," Now I want to ask you about that. You noted that that the tornado had gone through a town. Each one of these tornadoes causes potentially an awful lot of damage, and we've seen that this year. How do you balance chasing these tornadoes, this incredible, you know, acts of nature and capturing that on film and the obvious, you know, excitement that you get from that with the sheer devastation that's left in the path of these forces? __EOS__ Yeah. I've been chasing since 1999 and, you know, we've never encountered a year like this year. It's really taken that excitement and that passion that we feel when we chase and it supplanted it with dread of what you're going to find at the end of the chase. __EOS__ You know, I understand that your crew includes some who were personally affected by the most recent disaster, that huge tornado that just devastated the town of Joplin, Missouri. __EOS__ Yeah. Our navigator and meteorologist, Brandon Ivey, his cousin lives in Joplin. And she had a 5-month-old infant that she took into the bathtub as that tornado destroyed their house, and their house collapsed on top of them. They were pulled out by her husband. "
16," No. __EOS__ You didn't think  I'm hurting people's career, people worked really hard on this movie, they're probably decent human beings, this represents... __EOS__ I had that test come up. __EOS__ ...this is a heartfelt effort even though the product isn't very good? "
17," Yes.__EOS__ Listening to that, it sounds almost cantorial. It reminds me of some like Jewish music - some Hebrew music.__EOS__ Of course.__EOS__ You say of course. Why do you say of course?"
18," What's Going On? __EOS__  What's going on when all them guns is drawn? Here's a memo, remember there's a few wars going on. A couple overseas and on my front lawn, when common sense was common and now it's all gone. What's going on if that's going on? And what's going on… __EOS__ Now, when I listen to that that - now this features Chuck D - now this is completely different than the way Marvin Gaye put that song together. So tell me how you guys - you agreed upon this approach. __EOS__ Well, you know, it was really quite amazing, you know? "
19," I think what General Petraeus was saying is that there is going to be a level of violence in the society for a long time. And we know that societies have gotten to the point of this level of violence. That it takes a long time for it to get out of the system. And one of the things the president had said is our objective has to be to help the Iraqis get a government that can provide security, that can provide services, and can be an ally in the war on terror, both for their good and for our good. __EOS__ Will they be standing shoulder to shoulder with the American troops, though, as they try to cope with the violence over the next 10 years, will there be tens of thousands of American troops in Iraq? Yes or no? __EOS__ Well, what the president said yesterday was that we all want to get to the point where Iraqis have the government capacity and the security forces in order to take responsibility for security. Is there a role for the United States in helping that process after January of 2009? The president said, very clearly, he thinks there is. Where we are doing training and embedding, strengthening the Iraqi forces as they take responsibility for security. Being there to protect, obviously, our own interest, which are to go after al-Qaida, and to make sure that al-Qaida can never use Iraq as a safe haven from which to plan attacks against us. Help stabilize the country. Reassure the government. Keep the neighbors, in some sense, at bay. These are things that we can do in support of what over time everybody wants to be an increasing Iraqi role. __EOS__ Now, you talked about a precipitous withdrawal. What if we change the adjective there, and instead talked about a phased withdrawal? The president, yesterday, did - explicitly told members of Congress not to try to dictate… "
20," Yes. __EOS__ ...than - what happened? Did you start looking for different things, or did they see different... __EOS__ No. __EOS__ ...virtues in you? "
